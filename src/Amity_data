🎯 Insight 1: Mission Clarity + MTP Focus
Data Signals:
Amity’s Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP): Transforming mental health at scale through healing entrepreneurship and technological integration.

She has a clear multi-stage vision: course launch → build company → publish textbook → explore VR production.

Analytics Insight:
✅ MTP is well-formed and emotionally charged, with a clear personal “why.”
❗ Risk: Amity has too many simultaneous vectors (course, book, VR, film, marketing overhaul) without narrowed immediate focus, creating potential for overwhelm and diffusion of energy.

Suggested Metric:
➡ Mission Alignment Score: % of weekly actions Amity reports as directly serving her MTP.
(Estimate: ~60% — clear purpose, scattered execution)

🎯 Insight 2: Flow Readiness & Execution Capacity
Data Signals:
Amity has:

A complete course + inventory (TheraBox kits)

25+ interviews for book material

A dormant but existing email list (~1500)

Youtube channel + prior video content

She struggles with marketing, funnel optimization, and consistent audience engagement.

Significant cognitive load from balancing competing priorities and cash pressure.

Analytics Insight:
✅ Strong assets ready for deployment.
❗ Barrier: Execution bottlenecks (particularly marketing + funnel) + lack of clear weekly structure for flow triggers (clear goals, feedback, immediate progress).

Suggested Metric:
➡ Flow Readiness Index: Composite of (1) focus on clear daily/weekly goals, (2) primary flow activities, (3) recovery practices, (4) distraction management.
(Estimate: ~40% — high intent, low structured flow practices)

🎯 Insight 3: Leadership Leverage + Audience Building
Data Signals:
Amity aspires to lead a movement in mental health innovation.

She has prior proof-of-concept (virtual summit with 1000 attendees, industry speaking engagements).

Actively seeking to scale audience (email, webinars, Youtube, thought leadership).

Analytics Insight:
✅ High leverage potential — authentic, visionary, and with credible positioning.
❗ Needs consistent audience-building engine (newsletter, webinars, digital community).

Suggested Metric:
➡ Flow Leadership Leverage Score: Readiness to model and catalyze collective flow + build audience platform.
(Estimate: ~50% — strong foundation, audience engine still forming)
