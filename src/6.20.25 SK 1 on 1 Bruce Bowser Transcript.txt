WEBVTT100:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.080The Alliance: Record.200:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.450The Alliance: Hey Bruce.300:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.070Bruce Bowser: Sorry I was muted. Good afternoon, Steven. How are you?400:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.376The Alliance: I'm good.500:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.997The Alliance: One thing you should know is that there's a600:00:54.640 --> 00:01:05.675The Alliance: so wildfire burning 5 miles away from my house. I may get a new back order at any moment, so I may be up and running with the dogs. But700:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.249The Alliance: There's nothing to do.800:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.039Bruce Bowser: If you, if you prefer to, if you prefer to stay.900:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.610The Alliance: No, I honestly would rather just work through it, because otherwise you just sit here and you know what I mean. Like, I'm the cars are packed. We've got a plan, you know1000:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.780The Alliance: we've got hasn't1100:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.769The Alliance: regular systems. And hopefully we have some play. We've got a couple of places to go lined up. It's if our shit burns, then we've got a problem long term. But1200:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.810The Alliance: you know.1300:01:31.230 --> 00:01:48.669Bruce Bowser: As long as you're safe, and the pets are safe. Speaking about pets. Thank you for making my fucking life so busy with all your great ideas. My whole world has been consumed with the pet space, and1400:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.379Bruce Bowser: and I blame it on you. I mean I was in it before. But just1500:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.420Bruce Bowser: you know this, and it's where I wouldn't mind spending a little time talking a bit about today. But this you know, this new process that I've been working through. And honestly, please eat. I'll talk so.1600:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240The Alliance: Hold on one sec, sir. I'm sorry.1700:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.840Bruce Bowser: Yeah.1800:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.029The Alliance: Hey, honey, I'm in a meeting. Was that a real evacuation order or1900:02:13.401 --> 00:02:28.339The Alliance: Douglas County dispatch texted me and message me any back order for the Connor fire. But it it didn't, it said, evacuate the area now. And I was like, is it the same area, or did it move north, and we need to know.2000:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.570The Alliance: Will you find out for me and text me back if we have to get out of here?2100:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.929The Alliance: Sure. Thank you.2200:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.150The Alliance: Yeah. Okay, bye, all right. Problem solved.2300:02:41.440 --> 00:03:03.749Bruce Bowser: Yeah, well, I mean, let's hope. Yeah. So here's my what? I wouldn't mind focusing a little bit. So I'm teasing a bit when I say I blame you. But but I'm using this new process that you know, for an old guy, I'm surprised, you know, like the pieces make sense. But I'm surprised I haven't used this process, which is, you know, when I when I go to2400:03:03.800 --> 00:03:19.729Bruce Bowser: work on a problem or work on a opportunity. I'm now doing this stage thing where you know I I do. The brainstorming, I call it. We call it preparation, I think, in in your world, or when you taught us. But I'm doing like brainstorming, whiteboarding it.2500:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.589Bruce Bowser: and then I'm incubating it, letting things come to me illuminate. And then, you know, coming up with stuff to test2600:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.519Bruce Bowser: in the middle of all that I'm doing my microdosing. So I have, you know, guitars parked everywhere. So I do a little guitar playing. The things that work for me are guitar playing.2700:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.439Bruce Bowser: I'll go for walks2800:03:40.030 --> 00:04:09.949Bruce Bowser: because I live in a beautiful park area, so I'll go for walks which I never used to do, and I'll often put my earbuds in and listen to humor on my walk. So those are the micro doses that are working for me, and I'd be lying if I told you them, you know, spending a ton of time with drawing, although I am like, if I'm like, I'm drawing more ideas and like, I'm not drawing art. So it's like, I'm not drawing pictures, but I'm but it's on my to do list to keep working on have all the price. So my2900:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.289Bruce Bowser: my question to you is is3000:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.729Bruce Bowser: one of the things I'm not clear on, and maybe we covered, and I just didn't get it. But on that circle of the process I'm3100:04:20.839 --> 00:04:31.360Bruce Bowser: really finding helpful, like, what's timing like. So you know, I know if I've got a problem I gotta solve right away. I was gonna make a decision right. The the fire is now close my house. I gotta fucking go right.3200:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.191Bruce Bowser: But I'm thinking about and I'll stick with things that you know3300:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.967Bruce Bowser: maybe resonate with you. So I'm like balls deep into designing3400:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.009Bruce Bowser: pet friendly houses right? So I've.3500:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.130The Alliance: I have corrupted your soul.3600:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.840Bruce Bowser: You have corrupted my soul, and you've also created an opportunity that I like. But so I like.3700:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.209The Alliance: The Little People. Remember the little People, Bruce.3800:04:59.210 --> 00:05:22.719Bruce Bowser: I love the little people, and will always remember the little people so. But you know we've gone. I've worked with my builder. I've worked with the designer, and then I invented this shipping container years ago, that a huge success for me and I at the time I did it I hired an engineering firm that helps innovate and take things to market.3900:05:22.720 --> 00:05:45.769Bruce Bowser: So he, the gentleman that owns the company he partnered with me in the business. It's been a great 15 year success story for us. He was down here in Halifax a couple weeks ago, for a conference had reached out to me. Timing was impeccable, and I said, Hey, can we spend an afternoon brainstorming about some ideas I have around the the pet space one is, I'm going to create like an oral health4000:05:46.080 --> 00:05:57.360Bruce Bowser: device for dogs that I think will change, so we won't go down that path. We'll stay with the the design. So we started looking at us. Look, I want to create a pet friendly home. So.4100:05:57.593 --> 00:05:58.060The Alliance: Can I.4200:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.730Bruce Bowser: Yeah. Great.4300:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.319The Alliance: Time out for half a second.4400:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.379The Alliance: are we? I cause I do. I wanted to answer your 1st question really quickly about this timing of the cycle? Or are we still on that.4500:06:08.302 --> 00:06:12.997Bruce Bowser: Think I bypass that. So we let's go to the timing of the cycle because.4600:06:13.310 --> 00:06:20.889The Alliance: So let me, just because that's a quick, that's sort of a quick. It's a quick non answer. But here's the way I think about it.4700:06:22.700 --> 00:06:40.920The Alliance: flow neurochemistry peaks at about 90Êmin. Right? So if you drop into the zone, usually, and I'm I'm going from numbers that came out of the coding industry when they measured in the Peoplesoft survey. So I don't know if it applies to your you know what I mean. But they found that coders.4800:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.869Bruce Bowser: I got. This is my 90Êmin. Sorry.4900:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.980The Alliance: Yeah, and coders. It takes about people about 15Êmin to drop into flow5000:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.199The Alliance: on the front end. And so5100:06:50.500 --> 00:07:15.239The Alliance: there's you know what you know. That's like 90 plus 15 kind of thing which puts you in the in the sweet spot, anyways. So that's sort of going to be the maximum of a single flow state on average. Now, you know, Startup, rushing towards launch, should like to fucking flow all day long. I'm like me on deadline for a book, or maybe you on deadline for a book in flow all day long. Right, you know. So you know, it extends sometimes, and I don't know.5200:07:15.240 --> 00:07:25.111The Alliance: We used to think it was because of oxytocin, and we discovered that there's no oxytocin involved in solitary flow, so we can't actually explain it. But we know it happens.5300:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.960The Alliance: so. But I think about in terms of that. Then a release activity.5400:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.880The Alliance: And5500:07:33.450 --> 00:07:47.399The Alliance: usually then I like, I sort of busy work myself out and do like other people's shit, and then do a consciousness reset of some kind, meditation, eating nap whatever. And then I go back into another flow period, and5600:07:51.030 --> 00:07:58.460The Alliance: usually what I find is I could stay and struggle all morning, go to the release activity5700:07:58.760 --> 00:08:18.434The Alliance: in the afternoon I'll drop into micro flow. You know what I mean after I've sort of met, because I rew right. That's 1 of the advantages I think of having, sort of. If you can put 2 deep work sessions in the day. You could sometimes, you know, incubate in the middle, provided you have enough down regulation and state change in a sense. Calm yourself down, and you know, recharge the system.5800:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.260The Alliance: and recovery is interesting because I think it. You have to.5900:08:25.560 --> 00:08:51.829The Alliance: As you get better at this. You may be good at this already. You start to be able to sense neurochemistry in your body, especially norepinephrine and dopamine, norepinephrine vibrates right, it's speed. It's like, if you've ever done crystal math. That's what fucking feels like right? And dopamine is, Coke. So if you've ever done Coke, that's what it feels like one is one is Norepinephrine is usually a little more in the body, and, like6000:08:51.870 --> 00:09:01.569The Alliance: things are moving really fast in front of your forehead in the mind. Anyways, you learn to be able to sense the levels of that, those chemicals in your body over time, and6100:09:01.810 --> 00:09:10.679The Alliance: that sort of tells you like. Oh, this is where I am, and if it's really there, on the back end of a flow state you definitely want to recover6200:09:10.800 --> 00:09:24.030The Alliance: longer. Right. That's when you wanna like this, this stretching out is like, I'm tired, or I'm tweaking basically cause that could happen after a flow state like you get all those chemicals in your system, get excited and stuff.6300:09:24.280 --> 00:09:32.749Bruce Bowser: Yeah. So a question just on that recovery part. So here, is. A relatively new experience for me is.6400:09:32.960 --> 00:09:42.890Bruce Bowser: you know, I've you know my age. I've experienced lots of stress, right? And you know, some of it's been high pressure, negative stress from, you know, having to deal with banks and other shit my business.6500:09:43.000 --> 00:09:58.779Bruce Bowser: Now, my stress, I'm gonna say, is more on. I'm so fucking jacked about some of the shit I'm involved with, right like, you know, you talk with being in flow and and creating and and coming up with these ideas. It's like I'm have. I'm I'm finding hard to wind down right like it's like.6600:09:59.158 --> 00:10:18.479The Alliance: Okay. So yeah, yeah. Ease. I mean for me, it's so what? Literally I will at the back end if I can't come out of flow and up to Jack it's always one a sauna, always a sauna, because it automatically reduces cortisol. So you don't have to do it.6700:10:18.772 --> 00:10:21.990Bruce Bowser: I use this on in the morning before I'm jacked. Okay.6800:10:21.990 --> 00:10:45.389The Alliance: Yeah, so do it after do it as your recovery thing, because force it drops cortisol, as you know. Do. That's when you want to do the Vipassana meditation. It'll really slow you down and follow that by reading. And you want to just read something that's absorbed of a story that just sort of turns the brain off and sucks you in, and then on the backside of that6900:10:45.520 --> 00:11:08.359The Alliance: food will knock you out, because it'll slow your system down right? So like, that's when I put food in my system. And after food is literally when I do the stupid stuff that I know, like, I'll watch television. I'll watch, you know, videos on Youtube or a talk, or whatever because I know that stuff breaks flow intentionally, and I don't. And then I like. It takes me7000:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.560The Alliance: best of times.7100:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.120Bruce Bowser: 2Êh to wind down after my recovery activity. So I like.7200:11:17.470 --> 00:11:26.409Bruce Bowser: you're saying what I'm what I'm and apologize for, Stephanie, what I'm what I'm defining as stress you're saying is, I'm stuck in flow.7300:11:27.240 --> 00:11:53.249The Alliance: Well, I'm saying, either way, if you're heading towards Burnout, or you're heading towards over excitement. Right? And you're stressing the system that way. The the thing is that stuff is a little delicious. When you're in innovation mode, it's great. The problem is that when you notice, like, shit's gonna go up and down. You know what I mean. Stuff's gonna happen, and when it starts to tilt a little bit is a little less fun.7400:11:53.490 --> 00:12:12.449The Alliance: Now you're going to head towards Burnout. Because you have. You've been going so hard in fun mode you don't. You're actually not replenishing enough. So you just you just got to sort of look ahead and sort of like, as Branson says, protect the downside, because, you know, sooner or later it's going to come. So just try to build in these recovery activities.7500:12:12.450 --> 00:12:35.280Bruce Bowser: I've just got an ass backwards right now, because I'm I'm enjoying it to your point, having tons of fun. And look, there's not all roses, but you know I start my morning off with sauna meditation, cold plunge, and then I jump into my day, and and I'm not, you know. So I think what I'm going to do now is just a lot of my day where I'm doing this stuff is here in my home. I can jump into the sun like after this, and7600:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.509Bruce Bowser: and I didn't realize the Sauna actually drops cortisol. I knew what like all the you know, the other.7700:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.830The Alliance: Yeah. And you know I'll give you another one. So I don't. This is7800:12:43.940 --> 00:12:55.860The Alliance: this is really tactical, but but you may find yourself in these situations because you have to be on calls folks where it's important. I find that when I'm really in a generative mode.7900:12:56.000 --> 00:13:11.929The Alliance: or when I'm doing like a press tour, there's a lot of fucking dopamine. And so in between podcasts, because it's really dangerous to get too high on dopamine when you're talking to the press because you start, you get arrogant. You start saying, Stupid shit. The humility goes away, and like8000:13:11.930 --> 00:13:29.790The Alliance: bad, right? So I will literally there's a mountain right behind my house, and I will just like Dash, 500 yard, put on a weight vest, go 500 yards up the mountain, and come back down and take, you know. Do a 10Êmin up and a 10Êmin down or 5Êmin down.8100:13:30.060 --> 00:13:36.719The Alliance: Flush the dopamine out of my system. And then go into my next meeting. So I'll do that literally, like between.8200:13:36.720 --> 00:13:57.770Bruce Bowser: That's super helpful. Honestly, because I did not realize that it was more of a 1. i wasn't realizing that it's it's it's being in the state of flow, and not, you know, not. Give myself time to recover for 2. I didn't understand that. You know that the jacked up was an od of dopamine, so to speak, so that that's8300:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.830Bruce Bowser: that'll.8400:13:58.830 --> 00:14:03.020The Alliance: If you're jacked up, and it's fun, it's dopamine and norepinephrine.8500:14:03.020 --> 00:14:23.710Bruce Bowser: Yeah, no, that's what it is. So I'm gonna say, 75% of my world these days is jacked up and fine, because I'm working all these projects, you know, and we're still in the early stages of of the Vet. Space. You know, we got 10 clinics, you know, in in, either built in or open and you know, shit load more going. I hired a president, which means I can pull myself on operations which is negative.8600:14:23.710 --> 00:14:34.810Bruce Bowser: And now focus, you know, the last 3 weeks on, you know, vision. And you know, building the ship, that that we've talked a bit about the other question around timing is8700:14:36.800 --> 00:14:46.119Bruce Bowser: So you know, like you. To me it's like what you just suggested is sort of the micro timing of, you know, being when I'm working on a project8800:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.870Bruce Bowser: I was also thinking like, so I I do my prep.8900:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.910Bruce Bowser: I do all these micro doses. It's up in my whiteboard. How long do I leave9000:14:56.250 --> 00:15:18.919Bruce Bowser: it to incubate like like? I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing this in a day. I'm not right? So some of the stuff. It sits there for a day or 2. But is there, you know, some science to how long? So let's just use the the you know, the dog design thing as an example. I'm working on a particular project. Specific to that without getting into details. That's up on my board.9100:15:19.640 --> 00:15:29.169Bruce Bowser: I'm trying to think of my, you know. I probably could solve that today or not solve it, but, you know, bring it to a full circle today, if I spent, like, you know.9200:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.240Bruce Bowser: 3Êh with the breakups.9300:15:32.360 --> 00:15:41.080Bruce Bowser: But I'm I'm just not clear. Do I leave it? For you know? Better leave it for 2 or 3 days, and come back to it and let it incubate, or what like. That's what part of what I mean. By time, like.9400:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.730The Alliance: So I personally think9500:15:49.050 --> 00:15:57.030The Alliance: I don't know if I can give you an answer so. But here's how I think about it. Right one I have found historically with myself.9600:15:57.260 --> 00:16:12.729The Alliance: I'm never. I'm I'm rarely. I'm funny in the room. I'm witty. I can do pattern recognition, but I can't do long term lateral thing. I don't have big ideas in the room. I'm just sort of fun to have in the room. I have to hear all the information9700:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.379The Alliance: sleep on it, and if you catch me at 4 Am. The next morning9800:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.589The Alliance: I will have the solution by 5. Right? Like, that's what that that is. My standard incubation period.9900:16:25.040 --> 00:16:51.920The Alliance: for those processes. I think it's also the same when I get emotionally dysregulated and pissed off at somebody, and I need to make it businesses. Yesterday my old business partner, fucking, did something that pissed me off, and I was like I sent the text that I had to set that said you crossed the line. We're gonna take this project back right now and then. I waited 24Êh. You know what I mean like10000:16:52.500 --> 00:16:59.690The Alliance: till I respond, because I know it's gonna take that to get to a clear decision. Oh, this is what I should do. I got now. My emotions are out of the way.10100:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.390Bruce Bowser: Sure.10200:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.934The Alliance: Is how I think of it.10300:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.099The Alliance: And if10400:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.630The Alliance: that does not work, if that right, if I don't get, if the solution sort of like isn't.10500:17:14.880 --> 00:17:23.540The Alliance: I won't spend a ton of time on it. The next day I'll go look to see is there? You know what I mean like, are we there yet? If there isn't.10600:17:24.099 --> 00:17:35.049The Alliance: that's when I usually feed myself more information. You know what I mean. I like to get on a call and have a couple of conversations at that point. And10700:17:35.580 --> 00:17:58.610The Alliance: you know there's a bunch of so there's things I look for along the way that let me know. Oh, you've gathered enough information also. So sometimes it's I haven't gathered enough information to do the level of incubation I need. And I usually find that is to be the case. If I haven't gotten turned around on the idea, you know what I mean. If somebody hasn't convinced me that my idea is shit10800:17:58.610 --> 00:18:19.529The Alliance: once, and I've like almost given up and then been like. But wait this way. If that hasn't happened, I don't entirely trust it right, because I know you got to get turned around on good ideas, whether it's, you know, researching a story to report or starting a business. You gotta really get that until you can see all that stuff I don't go forward. Don't know if that's helpful. My answer your question, my.10900:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.649Bruce Bowser: No, no, that give me that's super helpful. So I you know I I think I was sort of11000:18:24.350 --> 00:18:31.610Bruce Bowser: I don't say stuck, but I was finding myself, you know. Okay, ideas up there. It's incubating.11100:18:31.985 --> 00:18:39.589Bruce Bowser: You know, like, for me, pattern recognition is when I'm brainstorming on it. Then I incubate do I let incubate for 24Êh? Do I let incubate for a week?11200:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.339The Alliance: Yeah. So let me give you 2 more quick answers.11300:18:43.340 --> 00:18:43.920Bruce Bowser: Yep.11400:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.610The Alliance: If there is a time constraint, if it's a business, you know I11500:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.490The Alliance: we'll create an art. I will create a deadline. I will have you?11600:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.000The Alliance: I'm gonna have this by Friday.11700:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.350Bruce Bowser: Yeah.11800:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.830The Alliance: One.11900:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.890The Alliance: I'm gonna flip.12000:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.560Bruce Bowser: Because I think it helps the brain. Time goes and stuff.12100:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.830The Alliance: Do12200:19:07.280 --> 00:19:17.119The Alliance: if I'm getting it's Thursday. Well, fuck, don't let the great be the enemy of the good. Now it's time to put those 3Êh in and just get to a fucking solution right?12300:19:17.420 --> 00:19:23.429The Alliance: And that's how I think about it. But usually, Bruce, what when I'm really incubating an idea.12400:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.740The Alliance: what I do is feed it on a daily basis.12500:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.759Bruce Bowser: 10 to 20Êmin a day.12600:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.440The Alliance: And never worry about it.12700:19:34.680 --> 00:19:46.500The Alliance: Usually, truth be told, once I'm like, Oh, I gotta feed this idea. I do it a couple of days in a row in my sauna at the end of the day the idea of the solution will pop in my head. I always bring a notepad into the Sauna.12800:19:46.946 --> 00:19:47.840Bruce Bowser: Same here.12900:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.070Bruce Bowser: Okay?13000:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.270Bruce Bowser: So I like that idea, you know, like, we'll use the.13100:19:55.659 --> 00:19:56.049The Alliance: Cool.13200:19:56.050 --> 00:20:25.920Bruce Bowser: Just use the example of the of the pet friendly home. Right? So that's not an overnight project, that's you know. I'm also using the 100 steps. Right? So I told myself down and say, Okay, you know, I want to get to a minimally viable product or service as quickly as I can. That makes sense. But I was, you know. I wasn't quite sure on how long this should leave. So with the. If you ask me to put the pet business, and maybe I'm kind of doing this. So the the pet friendly home business13300:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.250Bruce Bowser: I'm I'm seeing that as a 60 to 90 day.13400:20:31.550 --> 00:21:00.110Bruce Bowser: I guess. Maybe I call it incubation process. But where I need to gather information, right? So I get these ideas, talk to builder, talk to designer. Talk to engineers. Talk to you know, washing companies, because I'm envisioning something has, like, you know, a more friendly washing station than these traditional fucking, you know, mats with or not mats, but like, you know, a mini shower sort of thing. I don't know what's out there, so I'll go, and I'll do some some research, and it's sticking up there.13500:21:00.670 --> 00:21:07.079The Alliance: By the way, I have another one for you, because I was thinking about this. I don't know how to do this, and it's not13600:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.470The Alliance: we lose.13700:21:10.400 --> 00:21:22.179The Alliance: I I have to replace my washing machine or bring in a washing machine repairman like once every 4 months, because the amount of dog hair cause there are washing machines built for hair.13800:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.649The Alliance: and I don't like I just think about that. And I'm like, I don't know what that solution is, but13900:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.289The Alliance: hair gets into the ventilation ducts and into the washing machines in a way that, like14000:21:38.020 --> 00:21:56.120The Alliance: I like i, 1 of the things that I've always sort of wondered, is hair is very subject to static electricity. And what if you around the edges of your ventilation duct? We could run a microcurrent and sort of magnetize the outside. So the hair actually got trapped and traps around the ducts and didn't go in.14100:21:56.330 --> 00:22:03.790The Alliance: I don't know what the solution is inside the machine cause. I don't understand enough about how washing machines work. I think.14200:22:03.790 --> 00:22:12.760Bruce Bowser: And it just gave me 2 more, you know, problems to try to solve with with the engineers, because he'll know the answers to those questions about. You know, what can you do? Whether it's magnetized.14300:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.129The Alliance: So. But yeah, by the way, this, this is how I would.14400:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.169The Alliance: this is one of the things I would do to approach. That is literally like.14500:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.019The Alliance: have conversations with, you know.14600:22:23.930 --> 00:22:37.219The Alliance: the largest growth category right now is multi-ped households, so have conversations with multi pet household owners. Right? I met Bruce. When I 1st got into this I met a guy fucking up in Seattle as north of Seattle.14700:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.700The Alliance: He had built.14800:22:39.010 --> 00:22:51.880The Alliance: The bottom of his house was a barn where his horses were living, and he had, like this California modern house above it, and with like these balconies, so you could like look down onto the horses.14900:22:52.020 --> 00:22:59.960The Alliance: but he was trying to see, how do you integrate horses into? I wasn't even like just dogs and cats it was I was like. Oh, that's kind of interesting15000:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.850The Alliance: horses in the living room.15100:23:02.050 --> 00:23:28.309Bruce Bowser: Sounds like my girlfriend. She'd have the horses in the fucking bedroom. She's got the 12 horse. She's a show jumper, and and you know, 3 rescue pot cakes from Turks and caicos, she's like, I mean, and just, you know, off topic like it goes her boys. She has 2 twin boys who are, you know, going away to university this year? Then it goes horses. Then it goes. Dogs! She just added some cats to it, and then I'm somewhere between the cats and the.15200:23:28.310 --> 00:23:40.469The Alliance: Oh, yeah, dude, I'm married to that, I know. And, by the way, my my my niece is at Texas A. And M. On an equestrian scholarship. She won. She won Junior Nationals last year.15300:23:40.800 --> 00:24:01.079Bruce Bowser: If she, if she ever needs any. So one of my dearest friends again off topic. But one of my dearest friends is is a legend in the equestrian world. His name's Ian Miller. He was the Ian was the captain of the Canadian equestrian team for years, for whatever reason, I love horses, but I've never really ridden one, but we just became great friends 30 years ago, and so I've been partners with him.15400:24:01.492 --> 00:24:11.819Bruce Bowser: Throughout his entire career on on, you know Olympic horses. So the horses he's ridden so he's he's well recognized. If she ever wanted to talk.15500:24:11.820 --> 00:24:22.019The Alliance: Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, then. Now, I'll ask Matt Mia. His daughter's really like, just curious and engaging and cool, so that that might be a yes, yeah.15600:24:22.020 --> 00:24:38.129Bruce Bowser: The yes part would be, you know. I wouldn't be the one you want to talk to, but I would connect her with Ian's daughter is now the captain of the Canadian equestrian team, so pretty cool that the father was captain, for he's been to the most Olympics ever in the history of humans. So he's been to 11 Olympics, which means 44 years of.15700:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.430The Alliance: It's speech. Yeah.15800:24:39.430 --> 00:24:46.760Bruce Bowser: Yeah, just like MILL. A. R. Is is his name. Do you just give you just Google the most prolific. He's probably one of the top15900:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.650Bruce Bowser: 10 writers ever in the history of writing.16000:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.160The Alliance: Alright. Hold on! Let's let's do this after.16100:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.780Bruce Bowser: Okay. Cool.16200:24:51.920 --> 00:24:58.780The Alliance: Because we're gonna we're gonna go sideways on on animal decree for a while. Okay? So.16300:24:58.970 --> 00:25:06.249Bruce Bowser: But but those that's where I'm spending my time. And it's not that I want to talk about the animal stuff so much. It's just about I'm16400:25:06.400 --> 00:25:21.809Bruce Bowser: you've answered my 2 biggies, which is, you know, the sort of the timing on how to follow the process. I think I understand that you? You've answered the other one in terms of you know the you know the the build, the breaks that we built in release activities like the time.16500:25:21.810 --> 00:25:22.540The Alliance: Yeah, let's.16600:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.720Bruce Bowser: The big one was stress. Cause I'm I'm just finding like I'm16700:25:27.210 --> 00:25:38.489Bruce Bowser: you know, it's a new project for me. Relatively, I'm I'm now free to do visioning and creativity, and I'm like fucking wound up all the time. It's like I'm drinking Bourbon every night.16800:25:38.490 --> 00:26:01.089The Alliance: No, no, Bruce. I got off the plane yesterday after the Alliance event, and a big like a massive workday. I was so tired getting off the plane. I looked at Ryan. I was like, we're gonna I couldn't wait for him. I was like, I'm gone. I'll just like you. You get your car with. I'll see you later. I was just gone and got home, and I was like, Oh, I gotta work on this little bit of a science paper.16900:26:01.090 --> 00:26:13.610The Alliance: Next thing I know is 1030 at night. I still haven't gone to sleep, and I was like, this is insane. I'm like 4Êh past my bed. I'm I'm in it, too. I'm having that kind of thing. And what I'm trying to protect against17000:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.330The Alliance: is17100:26:15.270 --> 00:26:25.523The Alliance: where, if things get wildly like fire. You know what I mean. Now, this is no good for me, because, you know, so that I just I just try to get ahead of that. One thing I will say that17200:26:26.030 --> 00:26:33.240The Alliance: I haven't said about the incubation, because you're gonna find it helpful. I think usually what I notice with me is when17300:26:33.640 --> 00:26:41.880The Alliance: how I tend to solve the puzzle is, and this is what I do like. I'll gather information from experts, and then I will get on the phone with Ryan17400:26:42.070 --> 00:27:08.190The Alliance: and talk his face off for like an hour and freestyle. You know what I mean. And usually the answer will pop up, and I'll do that every 3 or 4 days, sort of along the way, just to sort of like, because I know it'll usually pop into my head sideways often because I said something funny. I was trying to crack a joke and like suddenly, there's the answer right?17500:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.840The Alliance: And I'm sure you've had that experience.17600:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.470Bruce Bowser: I mean I haven't. I haven't orchestrated like you just.17700:27:13.470 --> 00:27:24.889The Alliance: Yeah. And what I'm telling you. Here's the point I'm trying to get to. Which is the thing that I want you to really notice more than anything else is when solutions pop into your head.17800:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.809The Alliance: take a second to go. Oh, cool!17900:27:29.940 --> 00:27:39.069The Alliance: It worked right like. Just notice that it worked at the time, and check in with yourself and be like, Oh, cool! That worked. And the reason is18000:27:39.460 --> 00:28:03.369The Alliance: the real answer. Your question is, as you start to notice this stuff works, and you start to trust it and have confidence in your own ability, because people don't believe they have a pattern recognition system for a brain, because they've never actually used it to process for them. Right? They've they've let it process for them, but they don't actively use it. So until you see it a handful of times. You don't totally trust it. So what I'm18100:28:03.370 --> 00:28:19.069The Alliance: telling you to do is notice when it works, and if it doesn't work. Don't, don't sweat it. It'll start, you know. It'll it'll kick in sooner or later, because it's just the way the brain works. But notice it. That will shrink your incubation times also.18200:28:19.220 --> 00:28:25.900The Alliance: as you gain more confidence, incubation, time, your brain will. You'll those those breaks will come away.18300:28:26.290 --> 00:28:33.999Bruce Bowser: That that's super helpful. So on that note you just raised another wasn't on my list of questions. Ask you what's our timeline? By the way, I.18400:28:34.506 --> 00:28:45.029The Alliance: Wanna I got distracted for the 1st 10Êmin. Let me give you 10Êmin back because I got we've got. We're supposed to get off now, but I've got a little bit of time. I don't have another call for.18500:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.430Bruce Bowser: One of my other businesses. I own an orthopedic surgical hospital for Humans.18600:28:50.266 --> 00:28:57.590Bruce Bowser: And it was either in one of your books or something that I read on a plane or something. Recently.18700:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.421Bruce Bowser: it said, and you'll get this quicker than I will. But it said something about18800:29:04.870 --> 00:29:16.210Bruce Bowser: Surgeons tend to learn better and on a more ongoing basis than say, a Gp. And the reason it said, that is because they get instant.18900:29:16.210 --> 00:29:34.520The Alliance: Feedback. Yeah, that's they. They're the only that's they get immediate feedback. Somebody dies on the table, they know right? And the other ones don't. So the tighter feedback loops are right, we're gonna assign. So in 2 weeks I'm gonna assign you to a group of 3 people, and you're each, gonna you're gonna be feedback buddies. So you're gonna meet19000:29:34.610 --> 00:29:51.649The Alliance: every other week for the rest of the course, just to give each other feedback on ideas you can get. So you could 1st determine what's your minimal feedback for flow? And to start to put in protocols in place, because what you have to figure out is, how fast would it? So with writing.19100:29:51.690 --> 00:30:06.969The Alliance: I need feedback twice a week if I try to do it 3 times a week, unless I'm at the end of a book. It breaks the system. That's not enough incubation time, and it's not enough work time in between. So every project seems to have its own pace with that one.19200:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.170The Alliance: make sense.19300:30:09.450 --> 00:30:33.960Bruce Bowser: Yeah. And so it does make sense. And it's I'm looking for a little practical advice in this. So I have a group of orthopedic surgeons. After I'd read this we were, you know, the the leaders of that group were out for dinner one night, and I was talking about what I'd learned. And I said, That makes sense, and they said, totally makes sense. We never saw it that way, but it totally makes sense, because we're always going to these conferences, speaking, learning, doing research.19400:30:33.980 --> 00:30:47.440Bruce Bowser: Then I have part of my umbrella of health care that I look after. I've just been given a project to open up a colonoscopy clinic for cancer screening. Right big, big project.19500:30:47.970 --> 00:30:55.240Bruce Bowser: My colon cancer docs are. Most of them are Gis, right? So they're gastroenterologists, and they don't.19600:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.870The Alliance: Literally the worst.19700:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.260The Alliance: Yeah.19800:30:57.260 --> 00:31:10.610The Alliance: they never. They don't get feedback until you come back for the next fucking colonoscopy. So here's my answer to on that one which is a non answer. But you're going to love this. Do you know, Dan Kraft.19900:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.870Bruce Bowser: No? Oh, well, if I do it, it does not ring a bell.20000:31:13.870 --> 00:31:19.559The Alliance: Okay, so I'm gonna introduce you. I gotta get. I gotta email him.20100:31:19.940 --> 00:31:48.009The Alliance: It'll be a little slow because I don't have his text number. I just saw him, though. So it's perfect. I can email him this question, Dan is, he runs. He started at Singularity University with Peter, and was the expert on exponential medicine. He's a pioneer of stem cells, and has worked for doctors without borders, for fucking ever. So he's in the field doing hardcore field work, and he's a pioneer. He's the world's leading expert in what's at the cutting edge of medicine. His conference is next Med. You should go every year period.20200:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.380Bruce Bowser: Yeah, no, for sure. I'd love to. I mean, I'm always looking for conferences to go to. So.20300:31:51.380 --> 00:32:10.910The Alliance: Yeah, no. I was like, I want you should know Dan with your back with your stuff. But he if somebody's gonna know the answer to how do we provide cause? Your your question is, I want to tighten feedback loops for my oncologists. And right, and the answer is going to be20400:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.380The Alliance: something involving AI and some sent, you know, something along those lines.20500:32:16.380 --> 00:32:38.790Bruce Bowser: So here's a little more specific the problem because I think you're correct on on the broader sense of it. I'm so here's my situation with the just, quickly with the orthopedic surgeons. We're developing an orthopedic assessment center when I meet with them. They're super fucking, creative. They were like super adaptive. I'm talking to have you ever had a colonoscopy.20600:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.070The Alliance: Yeah.20700:32:40.070 --> 00:32:46.849Bruce Bowser: Yeah. So I'm talking to our Gis about, how do we improve the patient experience? The 2 worst parts of the experience are the prep.20800:32:47.070 --> 00:33:09.539Bruce Bowser: So the preparation night before and the beginning, unless they put you to sleep in Canada some places we don't put you to sleep. We just we sedate you, but you're not fully asleep, so I'm without getting into the details of what I'd like to do to make that a little more comfortable. So I had a group of 3 of them, I said, Look, I'd like to get together and have us do some creativity20900:33:09.540 --> 00:33:20.709Bruce Bowser: work around. How can we improve the process for the prep the night before, and I'm getting fuck all like, I mean, it's like they're they're not creative, like. Well, you know, that's the way. We've always done it, and it's like.21000:33:20.710 --> 00:33:28.150The Alliance: Got it? Got it? Okay, yeah, yeah, I have. So let me give you a quick answer. There, what happens in that room is so21100:33:30.130 --> 00:33:48.500The Alliance: it's essentially a version of analysis paralysis. By analysis. They're experts. They know what they they. So when you've got experts who are locked in. And they're all they want to do is tell you why that won't work, and why? Right and not give you shit right? You have to get them to.21200:33:48.520 --> 00:34:15.210The Alliance: Why, you have to ask the 5 why questions, hey? You got to get them up a level. You have to make the problem harder. So the problem isn't, how do we improve patient outcomes? The problem is, how do we end colon cancer once and for all, for example, right? Get them up a level so they can then get clear about where they are, and usually coaches. Do this by asking 5. Why questions in a row? Why do you do that? Why do you believe that?21300:34:15.370 --> 00:34:22.999The Alliance: Why do you want to do that? Why do you right? So usually, after 5 questions, you can get a room up above their expertise.21400:34:23.710 --> 00:34:34.560The Alliance: So you basically got to kick them side, kick their head sideways a little bit. And you're not going to get Gis laughing. You know what I mean you're not going to be able to do. You're not going to charm your way through this. You got to get them.21500:34:34.998 --> 00:34:45.480The Alliance: You gotta find a puzzle they wanna solve and lift it up above so you could get them past themselves. That's the issue. There are other. If if that doesn't actually work, there.21600:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.589Bruce Bowser: How do I go from there? So I get them up. We, you know, we we talk about. How do we solve.21700:34:49.590 --> 00:34:58.459The Alliance: So what happens is what what happens is once they pop above there. Usually the solution that you've been trying to sell, because I could tell you what this I mean. Like21800:34:58.730 --> 00:35:21.680The Alliance: you. The answer to your question is going to be threefold. I don't know what you do the night before, but there's going to be a VR solution to pre game. And I just met the woman who runs the largest VR wellness, mindfulness, app like thing in the world. So like, that's where that's gonna come from, right, plus21900:35:21.860 --> 00:35:29.290The Alliance: hopefully, the cocktails will improve a little bit. I don't know how you that fucking powder is terrible like all that's terrible before dude.22000:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.020Bruce Bowser: Yeah, it hasn't changed in 30 years. Right? So and again, not to.22100:35:34.020 --> 00:35:40.190The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I. So I think I think you're looking at the wrong end of the pipe on that one. By the way, I would say.22200:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.339Bruce Bowser: Don't play Nintendo.22300:35:41.340 --> 00:35:48.379The Alliance: You get like we're doing all this shit the night before, so you can run a sensor through me.22400:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.150The Alliance: Well.22500:35:50.320 --> 00:36:06.060The Alliance: we can have a poo chance chewing set, you know, nanobot sensors. You know what I mean that like. Solve that problem without you know what I mean. You just swallow the pills, and and there I would look that way rather than I don't like. I don't know how you.22600:36:06.670 --> 00:36:11.310The Alliance: That's a process that a lot of people have tried to optimize and optimize, but optimized to fucking dazz.22700:36:11.310 --> 00:36:20.220Bruce Bowser: I don't know. I don't know that they tried to optimize that look. I think what you're saying. There are. You know the signs out there that you can swallow a camera pill, and it will. It will go through the cold.22800:36:20.930 --> 00:36:26.790Bruce Bowser: The challenges. You know, knowing a little bit more about it is for them. So you know, the22900:36:27.240 --> 00:36:34.139Bruce Bowser: one of the primary purposes of doing colon cancer screening is removing polyps right? So polyp that isn't.23000:36:34.140 --> 00:36:42.159The Alliance: Oh, I know I like, I gotta go get like I'm overdue for a colonoscopy, because they removed the largest polyp that we've ever seen for my colon 5 years.23100:36:42.160 --> 00:36:49.059Bruce Bowser: Which is really good news for you, because that means that that's not going to become cancerous, left untreated. It'll become cancerous. So the23200:36:49.250 --> 00:37:14.170Bruce Bowser: you know the I don't. I think they need a clean colon, right? But again, without getting into details. So I'm trying to. I have my ideas right. My ideas are, you know. Bring them in the day. Bring them in an hour before, and you know we'll put them to sleep for a second. Shove a fucking garden hose up their ass and just blow it all up out their mouths. Right? That's not quite what I'm thinking, but you know, just we'll clear the fucking Colon with the garden hose, and23300:37:14.170 --> 00:37:19.410Bruce Bowser: you know, and a proper system that's just, I'm coming out from the other direction. I'm like, you know. Shove the hose down.23400:37:19.410 --> 00:37:24.830The Alliance: That's a colonic. You know what I mean. All you're saying is, do a colonic before the fucking procedure.23500:37:24.830 --> 00:37:48.290Bruce Bowser: Most people don't like things shoved up their ass right. And it's like, you know. So let's put them to sleep for that, like I mean, I'm big on Profifol, and you know, that gets us into another topic I've been talking about. I've actually got them to move, and I'm trying to think when you were saying that, like I got them to. So in in where you get your colonoscopy done, they probably put you on profile, which knocks you right out for the time. You're out23600:37:48.860 --> 00:38:18.720Bruce Bowser: some docs, if you Google, you know, for some research, they say, well, we really want the patient somewhat conscious so that they can move a little bit sedated. So they're not uncomfortable. The worst part of the experience, we all agree, is like the doctor himself is the insertion of the scope. So I'm saying, if we put them on propofol for the insertion and their sleep for that great, then we, you know we can withdraw it, because that's as soon as you withdraw. It stops working and put them on milder sedation. And I'm kind of my mind, and I'm getting the solutions, but it's like23700:38:19.290 --> 00:38:27.020Bruce Bowser: flush them out on Profifol. Put them on profool, you know. Flush them out, whatever you know, the the process is for flushing them out.23800:38:27.080 --> 00:38:48.639Bruce Bowser: They don't know the doctors have to be there. It's way too glorified for doctors. I'll hire, you know, asshole cleaners to come in and flush them out, and then they can go to the process. That's the type of creativity that we're thinking about. I was able to get the doctors to think about changing the protocol from? No, we're not putting them on profile. We're going to sedate them, and they're going to suck it up to now, saying.23900:38:48.640 --> 00:39:13.449Bruce Bowser: okay. You know. Maybe we'll do profile for the 1st 30 seconds. We're going to live. You hooked up, anyway, for the 1st 30 seconds not even. We'll do profile as soon as we're in. We withdraw the profile. I'm just trying to think what I did to get them to think about that. I was almost pleading. I think me saying, guys, we need to think outside the box like it's like all your questions. All your answers are very scientific.24000:39:13.490 --> 00:39:17.630Bruce Bowser: I'm talking practical like. Yes, you know you need the patient.24100:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.760The Alliance: Yeah, so what? You're yeah, it's24200:39:20.820 --> 00:39:39.849The Alliance: one. You gotta figure out what they care about. Yeah, right? What's important to them. Right? You know, the the 1st question is, guys, we all want to improve patient outcomes. So what? When I say that to you? What are the things that are interesting? What outcomes? Do you want to.24300:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.940Bruce Bowser: A patient experience. Right? So it's a it's not experience.24400:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.030The Alliance: Patient experience whatever.24500:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.059The Alliance: Why do you want to improve patient experience?24600:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.820The Alliance: I want to improve patient experience, because it'll help my bottom line24700:39:53.110 --> 00:40:10.470The Alliance: or right? Why do you want to help your bottom line cause I want my wife and kids to be safe. I want to have a future. You know what I mean, like those are, get them up above. So you could actually talk. What is the real problem? And then link that to the solution is how I think about that. Does that make sense.24800:40:10.470 --> 00:40:20.830Bruce Bowser: Yeah. Super helpful, Steve. It's been. We're 2, 10. Thank you for giving extra 10Êmin. I'm conscious in the back of my mind that you need to get out of dodge, so hope that everything goes well.24900:40:20.830 --> 00:40:30.939The Alliance: No, I I hold on. Let me just check. Okay, yeah, there's no evacuation. I got a second I just want to say, before I go, yeah.25000:40:32.260 --> 00:40:38.169The Alliance: talking to you has been like, it's just, it's so fun. Cause25100:40:38.170 --> 00:41:07.720The Alliance: you're such a creative leader. You actually don't believe you are. But you're such like you're. I think you're the most honestly between me, you and the wall. I think you're the most you like. Ryan and I both said, we think you're the actually best creative leader out of the group, even though you don't see yourself that way. It's really clear. And you are. It's so fun to watch how fired up you are. It's really fun. This is like everybody else is sort of in a different point on the pendulum. But this is, I built a creative velocity accelerator, and this is what it looks like. Right.25200:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.499Bruce Bowser: No, no, look! I mean it. It's been like it's working for me.25300:41:11.790 --> 00:41:38.590The Alliance: It's working for everybody. It's just when you're in a different place on the map they came. Everybody came in thinking they were creative leaders. A lot of these people are. I want to be a creative leader. But I'm really a knowledge worker making that transition in my career which is great, and some of them have made a lot of money along the way, so they're well funded into the next zone. But you cross that threshold already into creative leadership. And now we've sort of armed it. I think, a little bit.25400:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.239Bruce Bowser: Yeah, I know for sure.25500:41:41.240 --> 00:41:49.710The Alliance: It's just delightful. It's a lot of fun to watch, man, that's all I'm saying. Well, you weren't there. So just so, you know.25600:41:49.710 --> 00:41:59.750Bruce Bowser: My daughter is 5 days overdue. I would have been there. My! So my daughter was supposed to have a baby last weekend, and I was gonna come as soon as baby. She's 5 days overdue, so she's still in the baby, so I would have been there25700:41:59.960 --> 00:42:07.470The Alliance: No, no, don't worry about it. It's like, so I just want to give you the next couple because you weren't at the alliance. Ryan will send this out, but we're going to go to Hood25800:42:08.044 --> 00:42:26.329The Alliance: to go skiing on the 16th and 17th of June of July. And So we're gonna just do a meet up up there. If you want to come skiing again chase is gonna come and and and ski with the, you know, the slower group, and whatever.25900:42:26.330 --> 00:42:26.649Bruce Bowser: Oh, yeah.26000:42:26.650 --> 00:42:37.036The Alliance: It's sort of. I mean, this one is gonna be every person sort of for themselves. One because it's not that big, and there's nothing. There's no, there's nothing scary. Nobody can get themselves into trouble at hood.26100:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.670The Alliance: all right.26200:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.883Bruce Bowser: I think I can make that. I'll26300:42:41.200 --> 00:42:48.627The Alliance: The other with the next one. After that you might like this. We're gonna go to Chicago, August 11th to see Lincoln Park.26400:42:49.110 --> 00:43:04.199The Alliance: I'm dying to go see the new fucking lineup. I love that new lead singer. I think she's dope. I was the link bark fan. Now I'm like crazy about them. And I'm just like, Hey, I'm going to do this. Who wants to come. So a bunch of people actually want to come. So a bunch of people are doing that. And then.26500:43:04.410 --> 00:43:31.750The Alliance: if you happen to be on this coast right before we go, I I have to be in La on September 3.rd So we're, gonna I think, gonna do a dinner in la, really, probably low key and early, because I'm gonna have to cut out the next day. But or early. But and then we have, you know our clothes. So that's what's coming, and I'll run that down again on next next, or you know, at the beginning of the month, and Ryan will send shit out and blah blah.26600:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.089Bruce Bowser: Perfect. I wrote the note.26700:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.069The Alliance: It was fun. It was a fun event.26800:43:35.070 --> 00:43:41.171Bruce Bowser: I look. I I have regular conversation with Stephanie. She's my new, best friend, Stephanie, the vet26900:43:41.530 --> 00:43:48.227The Alliance: I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm so glad. Yeah, no, it's I like what's going on.27000:43:50.380 --> 00:43:56.710Bruce Bowser: Yeah, use me as a recommendation, because it gives me whatever you want. But tell Ryan that. But I've it's been like incredible.27100:43:56.710 --> 00:44:02.539The Alliance: By the way, so do you know what Amity is trying to do at our horse ranch, or horse therapy ranch?27200:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.869Bruce Bowser: Went to the site. I I I27300:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.190Bruce Bowser: I don't really know. I know that she's a therapist.27400:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.200The Alliance: She's interesting.27500:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.650The Alliance: and she's got a cool vision for the future with, for where she thinks she could take some of this stuff.27600:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.310The Alliance: her Chief Funder.27700:44:19.570 --> 00:44:29.800The Alliance: who is her partner just like ran out of money. So she's got. She's, you know. She's got an 80 acre horse ranch and no funding at this point, and is in scramble mode.27800:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.350The Alliance: I don't know if it's27900:44:31.960 --> 00:44:39.089The Alliance: a good investment, a bad investment. Good idea, bad. You know what I mean. I think there's really cool stuff in horse therapy28000:44:39.340 --> 00:44:54.260The Alliance: that is interesting. And she wants to bring technology into it and take it into the future. So I think it's interesting, like, I think there's potential there. But she needs some really serious adult supervision between me, you and the wall. I mentioned this because if you're interested28100:44:54.470 --> 00:45:10.140The Alliance: reach out, but know that I think strategically, she needs she needs some adult supervision, like I think she could do the therapy stuff and the horse stuff and the people stuff. I don't think she could do the business stuff to save her fucking life, and I think she's gonna get creamed if she doesn't get some adult supervision.28200:45:10.450 --> 00:45:29.300Bruce Bowser: Happy, I mean, look her. And I I think one of our breakout sessions said, let's have a call together and talk so happy to call. I'm probably like, I'm so hyper focused on the current vet space I'm in and and expanding that. And then the healthcare stuff that I've you know. Thanks to you, I've you know I picked like 2 lanes and some, you know.28300:45:29.300 --> 00:45:52.739The Alliance: I'm the only reason I put it like I probably was probably not even mine to share. Exactly. Maybe I'm putting in your head, not as hey? Do you want to take this on more as Hey, you're in the animal space. Maybe you know somebody who's interested in you know what I mean, like, whatever it is, I think she's I don't think she thinks she's in as much trouble as I think she's in, but I'm like looking at that going28400:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.550The Alliance: that like doesn't feel safe to me.28500:45:55.750 --> 00:46:17.959Bruce Bowser: Yeah. Well, look, I might just reach out to, because I I you know, for some reason it was on me to to say I should have a chance to. I should talk to Amity out of all the group. Her and Stephanie were 2 that you know kind of I think the 2 that kind of connected most with and maybe the lady in la, but but I'll I'll reach out to you because I think look, I'm I'm a huge fan of28600:46:18.140 --> 00:46:27.299Bruce Bowser: the power of horses. I didn't realize until I started dating this crazy, fucking horsewoman. You know the you know the.28700:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.509The Alliance: No, it's no, it's28800:46:29.560 --> 00:46:43.891The Alliance: it's the real deal. And I I really do. I like I I if you could get her the if she could find the right partners. She's she's got the right head for this and she's a pretty good spokesperson for it. So28900:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.137The Alliance: yeah, anyways, it is is what it is, but29000:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.649Bruce Bowser: You and I could talk forever. Is the thing so.29100:46:49.650 --> 00:46:54.559The Alliance: Yeah, I gotta I got. I gotta go now into my next thing. Thank you, sir. Be good.29200:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.420Bruce Bowser: Love, love, talking.
