WEBVTT100:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.300JasonTadros: There we go!200:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.159The Alliance: How are you, sir.300:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.950JasonTadros: I'm doing well. How are you?400:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.212The Alliance: I'm well, thank you.500:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.607The Alliance: Tell me, tell me what's going on. How are we? What's the600:08:22.150 --> 00:08:31.639The Alliance: What are the biggest biggest insights for the cap past couple of weeks. It sounds like from talking to Ryan that you're making some serious progress, and this stuff is really fired you up.700:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.100JasonTadros: Yeah, in so many ways.800:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.169JasonTadros: So progress. Let's see, I'll I'll just start off with. So from a from a research perspective.900:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.930JasonTadros: I started off.1000:08:46.443 --> 00:08:53.430JasonTadros: I don't know if I updated you last time on this but I had great success using my algorithms on turbulence data.1100:08:54.234 --> 00:09:03.131JasonTadros: That pretty much matches, some of the basically, the big labs1200:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.389JasonTadros: data much faster that itself could be a service. I took the same algorithms1300:09:12.570 --> 00:09:22.469JasonTadros: use that to train an AI model. And so attractive descent models actually work. And they perform very, very well.1400:09:23.165 --> 00:09:31.409JasonTadros: And then I took the same technology and use that back on flow. And Eeg readings.1500:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.780JasonTadros: And I saw some amazing things that I like to share as well.1600:09:36.432 --> 00:09:45.449JasonTadros: And so long story short, this algorithm is, or I don't know all the work that I'm doing to optimize these Gpu kernels1700:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.049JasonTadros: are working really, really well.1800:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.220JasonTadros: And I'm pretty much able to do1900:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.929JasonTadros: supercomputer stuff like on on desktop gpus.2000:09:58.650 --> 00:10:14.459JasonTadros: So that's pretty cool and applies to lots of different stuff. So I've had good conversations with researchers at Ub, here. Looking at using algorithm to sort of remove noise from electron microscope images.2100:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.150JasonTadros: I'm working on patents. I don't know if you can see me. Sorry I'm looking down2200:10:20.754 --> 00:10:49.050JasonTadros: working on patents right now, getting all of those out, and then I'm sort of sharing it with you as I'm doing this. But I'm also have a application. I filled out for Darpa a Darpa challenge for using sort of these algorithms to create a what's the word? A autonomous math agent? Basically. That can sort of solve problems using attractive descent2300:10:49.710 --> 00:11:11.999JasonTadros: and then a local incubator I've applied for as well. Down here in downtown buffalo. Because I'm looking to. Oh, and I did get aws and Amazon also to give me cloud credits and take me in as a partner, and all that kind of stuff as well.2400:11:12.451 --> 00:11:21.730JasonTadros: And so I'm waiting to next Friday have meeting with them? And then kind of my negative would be.2500:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.032JasonTadros: I can't keep up I gotta scale2600:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.970The Alliance: Hold on!2700:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.750JasonTadros: My God.2800:11:30.750 --> 00:11:41.190JasonTadros: if it's good, is doing great actually, part of that is is a bit of my problem. My wife2900:11:42.232 --> 00:11:46.679JasonTadros: was sort of gonna be CEO3000:11:47.183 --> 00:11:50.519JasonTadros: but we were gonna sort of grow this in that way.3100:11:51.397 --> 00:11:57.439JasonTadros: And because it's sort of taking off so quickly. She doesn't feel that she can3200:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.880JasonTadros: maybe fully support that role. So now I'm3300:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.249JasonTadros: you know, actively kind of try to put together a team, and3400:12:07.490 --> 00:12:28.990JasonTadros: you know, get get, get, get funding and launch this thing. I mean, at minimum, I can start launching some of the services I mean, even for for your work. I've already. I have a whole sort of plan for you and your collaborators. To optimize all of the work. And it's really, really amazing, because I'm able to like. See, now.3500:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.709JasonTadros: here is one of my amazing things. I'll just say.3600:12:33.020 --> 00:13:00.850JasonTadros: I think that you already know this. But I actually saw walking basically distribute network out to individual sort of pockets or island sort of working in an autonomous way. And then, more sort of deep thought and thinking, and high action sort of movie things and actual. See that coalesce3700:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.139JasonTadros: and that was really really neat to see in 3D.3800:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.940JasonTadros: So.3900:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.200The Alliance: I have no idea what you just said to me.4000:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.420JasonTadros: You really.4100:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.849The Alliance: No idea what you just said to me.4200:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.189JasonTadros: I would love to show so- so- so here.4300:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.769The Alliance: I, Jason, before we get like you're diving deep into your research.4400:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.099JasonTadros: Well, yeah.4500:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.370The Alliance: Totally cool. But we we have 25, 5Êmin.4600:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.519The Alliance: Do you want to spend it on that?4700:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.099The Alliance: Having like, what do you want to spend the next 25Êmin on. I gotta. I gotta pause you before we go too deep into this.4800:13:35.100 --> 00:13:45.279JasonTadros: Yeah. So here's my, my thing is I absolutely need to move forward. I think my company, everything's doing great. Just from a A4900:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.070JasonTadros: in this area of flow or neuroscience and thing. I would love to work with you5000:13:52.009 --> 00:14:06.490JasonTadros: and get access to some data and be able to run it through the system. And whatever comes out, you know we can. We can figure out figure out what what you want to process, and I'll I'll look at that.5100:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.450JasonTadros: let's see. And then other than that, I think I need to5200:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.550JasonTadros: figure out how I'm going to.5300:14:17.850 --> 00:14:29.060JasonTadros: So for the turbulence system. My plan right now is is to go out to some of the local defense providers, or, sort of, you know, tier one or primes5400:14:29.606 --> 00:14:32.523JasonTadros: and and basically see if they can.5500:14:33.110 --> 00:14:38.984JasonTadros: sort of come on and use this as a cost saving measure initially as as early adopters.5600:14:40.110 --> 00:14:47.600JasonTadros: But I'm you know, again. Business side is not my my my specialty. So that's5700:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.570JasonTadros: what I'm trying to just, you know, scale up right now.5800:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.170The Alliance: Do you have funding to scale it up.5900:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.009JasonTadros: I can get funding. Yeah.6000:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.920The Alliance: Okay? So that's not. That's an issue is the team. The issue.6100:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.940JasonTadros: A team of players that I actually would trust. Probably, yeah.6200:15:16.300 --> 00:15:25.590The Alliance: So I see a couple of immediate6300:15:26.650 --> 00:15:34.020The Alliance: opportunities, slash challenges, and and they make me wonder about things. So in my experience.6400:15:34.260 --> 00:15:52.460The Alliance: Ceos are really impossible to find good Ceos are really impossible to find. They, you know what I mean. They tend to emerge naturally, organically, in the project, but but the the more we could never find a CEO to run the Flow Research collective, because6500:15:52.730 --> 00:16:01.470The Alliance: blow was too complicated for me to wrap their fucking head around so they couldn't get the product, let alone the company right? Your stuff6600:16:01.710 --> 00:16:26.729The Alliance: is like, I mean, I've been listening to you talk for a while. Now I have a little bit of an idea of what you're talking about, but a little bit so I that that like that strikes me as a oh, I don't! I don't do. I'm not saying solution or not, but when I look at that one, I think oh, I also I've been listening to you now for a while, and it sounds like6700:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.127The Alliance: product development is solid like you've got some. It's working. It's doing a thing.6800:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.579The Alliance: do you have a sales deck6900:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.250The Alliance: like a sale, but like cause I've listened. You explain it7000:16:40.360 --> 00:16:52.239The Alliance: 4 or 5 different angles now 4 or 5 different ways, and I'm a really smart guy, and I listen to a lot of this stuff, and I don't have a clue what you're talking about most of the time with it. So if that's I'm I'm not trying to be a.7100:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.320JasonTadros: No, no! I love that.7200:16:53.320 --> 00:17:03.724The Alliance: I'm trying to be honest with you. So like now, some of these things are a little outside my area, but just only a little. So my point is, this is7300:17:05.540 --> 00:17:34.580The Alliance: this is cool, because it's actually like, it sounds really hard. It's not really hard. It's a creative storytelling problem. You just need to take this and like enlisting you up thinking, okay, he's right on the edge of funding. And he's right on the edge of building a team, and he's got to find the right. All that stuff. Otherwise you waste a time so. And it's a big idea. So I think, like, if it was my next step, I would think, okay, how do I turn this into a7400:17:34.660 --> 00:17:42.369The Alliance: 15 to 20 slide Powerpoint deck, where there's not an overwhelming amount of information on each slide, and7500:17:42.860 --> 00:17:55.080The Alliance: you could actually almost look at it without me in the room and understand what it is that I'm selling. And the opportunity here. If you you know what I mean like, that's where I would start, because what I like about Powerpoint is.7600:17:55.280 --> 00:18:18.389The Alliance: It's the ultimate like for me. It's the ultimate ego blow, because your brilliance goes out the fucking window. Right? You're like, Oh, shit! All I gotta do is like, what's the minimum like the right, and it's but I I get it because I know I've said in a Powerpoints that if you've got more than like headline and 2 or 3 details on the slide. It doesn't work right? It's really should just like, be a headline, a picture, and like7700:18:18.760 --> 00:18:27.570The Alliance: 20 seconds of what you say, kind of thing, but it might like that as a the next step7800:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.319The Alliance: might be interesting for you, I think. Do you like? Does that make sense.7900:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.189JasonTadros: Does that resonate at all?8000:18:35.420 --> 00:18:44.440JasonTadros: It it absolutely does. I've done drafts of that, I guess. Where I'm at. A bit of a crossroad is is what keeps happening with the platform.8100:18:45.134 --> 00:18:58.170JasonTadros: So I'll just kind of say where I've come to. Is almost coining something new. And I think that is you're saying, I, I need to create a narrative around it because it's basically an information topology platform.8200:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.630JasonTadros: So I mean anything complex systems.8300:19:04.686 --> 00:19:15.609JasonTadros: It works really, really well for finding needles in the haystack sort of pushing it up into different dimensionality and looking at it. It's kind of a math8400:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.010JasonTadros: system. But using topology as a information mechanism.8500:19:22.877 --> 00:19:32.880JasonTadros: And it speeds up lots of key areas. And that's what I think I can simplify. The key areas is, I have services that speed up Eeg readings.8600:19:33.415 --> 00:19:41.489JasonTadros: I can do that in real time. I can do 42Êh worth in like 36Êmin.8700:19:42.399 --> 00:19:44.839JasonTadros: So it's pretty fast.8800:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.800The Alliance: Okay, so this is a great like, okay. Now I got it.8900:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.300The Alliance: I just followed everything you said.9000:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.020JasonTadros: Okay.9100:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.815The Alliance: And yeah, like. And and in information, topology9200:19:56.670 --> 00:20:22.430The Alliance: I'm not gonna say that everybody you're gonna encounter is good, like, I know what graph theory is, I know you know what I mean, like, I right? And all that stuff so like when you say an information policy, I'm like, Oh, I know exactly what you built now I now I now I see, because if you built a way to visualize a much more complicated landscape and make it simple and speed up data processing. Okay, cool. I get that. That's very saleable.9300:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.849The Alliance: my question is, that sounds like a services company9400:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.149The Alliance: to me. Just to start. So hold on9500:20:34.560 --> 00:20:49.290The Alliance: with a services company. Are you sure you need a CEO? You may need a part time, Cfo. And a chief sales officer, and then somebody to make sure the digital product gets delivered on the back end right.9600:20:49.290 --> 00:20:57.749JasonTadros: You're you're absolutely right. Here's where actually, I kind of ran into a bit of a wall. I'll say so. I applied for this Darpa challenge9700:20:58.659 --> 00:21:12.330JasonTadros: and basically long story short, if you read through a lot of it, that's why I'm patenting everything as fast as possible. But the the problem that I I think I actually will come under import9800:21:13.665 --> 00:21:38.069JasonTadros: protections. So right now, I'm looking at basically putting it and bundling it with Nvidia. So either kind of like selling it in hardware on premise close, you know, sort of air gap type solutions or, as you're saying, services. But services I have to pass all kinds of things. If I'm doing medical, I have to pass a ton of licensing on most.9900:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.379The Alliance: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, I see those problems. I get it.10000:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.250The Alliance: That's it.10100:21:45.130 --> 00:21:59.620JasonTadros: Although the Pia is not too bad, because I throw away all the data, I just process it in the cloud. But still I have if I'm doing services. That's 1 thing. But if I sell you a box that just process your Eeg data near real time.10200:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.520The Alliance: Box, meaning you're going into hardware or box.10300:22:05.520 --> 00:22:16.639JasonTadros: Oh, I'm all I'm all in on, I think, partnering with Nvidia frankly, I'm accelerating everything, using Gpus. I could use neuromorphic chips. Jump on my own thing. But right now10400:22:17.050 --> 00:22:24.590JasonTadros: it's easy just to jump on to Nvidia hardware. Be a partner. Quote sell my pieces with that.10500:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.270JasonTadros: and then license. SDK, license usage, you know10600:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.700JasonTadros: the bucket, Eeg reading, or something. I don't know.10700:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.860The Alliance: Still need a good salesperson.10800:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.180JasonTadros: I do. Yeah, but that's the piece.10900:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.550The Alliance: Nice.11000:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.540JasonTadros: I got into as a service piece. That kind of broke me for a little bit.11100:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.979JasonTadros: And these specific areas I've solved at least.11200:22:48.190 --> 00:22:56.250The Alliance: Yeah. So beyond a Powerpoint that tells the story bum.11300:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.699The Alliance: And by the way, that Powerpoint could also have a little video, you know what I mean, like you.11400:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.020The Alliance: yeah.11500:23:01.020 --> 00:23:07.680The Alliance: messing up with a lot of stuff like that. You probably should, because I bet there's the visuals make this easy. I would.11600:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.870The Alliance: The next thing I would do strategically.11700:23:11.980 --> 00:23:33.599The Alliance: because I'm listening. And I'm like, okay, boxes are a long lead time, right? Selling somebody a new system, even if it's gonna save the massive time they know there's onboarding costs new right? It takes a while. That's a longer sales process. That's a longer sales cycle. That's probably 5 to 10, right? That's a team. So11800:23:33.940 --> 00:23:44.030The Alliance: and I'm not saying bad. I'm saying slow, right when I read your thing right? So if you wanna right speed things up. I would. I would start with saying.11900:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.569The Alliance: Where what kind of service can I offer?12000:23:48.060 --> 00:23:52.689The Alliance: That's not regulated? Where's the unreg? Right? Where's the unregulated.12100:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.990JasonTadros: Finance. So I landed in finance.12200:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.162JasonTadros: So I've got a quant friend,12300:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.273JasonTadros: looking at sort of turbulent systems. Lots of change lots of cool algorithms. The system does topology. Right?12400:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.920JasonTadros: yeah.12500:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.550JasonTadros: And that's kind of where I've landed. But I wasn't in any of those areas or working in them. So that's kind of a new.12600:24:17.000 --> 00:24:36.189The Alliance: Yeah, I get it. It's a pivot. I just when I look. When I listen to things like this, I always ask myself, where's the big vision? What's the Bootstrap version? And how do you bring them together? Because I find that the people, the the vision, gets crushed in the quest for money, the, you know, like the average.12700:24:37.630 --> 00:24:47.600The Alliance: even with the full team, even like when you're more than just a lone inventor guy, it can be 150 to 200 conversations. It doesn't sound like you have that kind of time.12800:24:48.020 --> 00:24:54.109JasonTadros: My goal is to peel off supercompute people waiting for supercomputer access.12900:24:54.310 --> 00:24:59.499JasonTadros: So if I can peel off people that just need this, you know that13000:25:00.060 --> 00:25:12.600JasonTadros: they don't have access to the National Lab. They're waiting for it. They want to run some of their stuff. I can take time. Mine's very, very fast. I can compress time for those people, and I can run it for cheap on a.13100:25:12.600 --> 00:25:22.179The Alliance: Alright, I'm gonna ask you a really weird question. This is just it just popped into my head. I don't even know this. This may be a nonsensical question. I don't want to use your time on it, but I'm gonna ask you this.13200:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.810JasonTadros: Yeah.13300:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.290The Alliance: So13400:25:27.230 --> 00:25:39.528The Alliance: data centers, even data centers that recycle their heat and capture heat and turn. Each is a turbulence problem. Data center. Heat is a turbulence problem. Am I wrong? It's not right. I'm right.13500:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.279The Alliance: being that AI centers are going up like. That's where I would start. I'd be like like.13600:25:46.540 --> 00:26:04.189The Alliance: like I'd look at like what market is exploding. What's a turbulence problem? If you could walk into data centers and say, Look, if we run your fucking system through my system. We're gonna find on average, at 30% savings of electricity. You're talking13700:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.360The Alliance: billions of dollars right there. So that's a like.13800:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.360JasonTadros: That's a good.13900:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.220JasonTadros: Yeah.14000:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.810The Alliance: I've just. I've just I. So when I'm looking14100:26:16.190 --> 00:26:41.820The Alliance: for my next thing, like when I'm trying to build something right, I'm building the alliance for creative leaders. You know what I mean, because that's sort of where I want to go, but there's also like, I'm also I always protect the downside, and I'll by protecting the downside. I'm always like, well, where's the market right now? The market's in AI and longevity. So I've been slowly talking flow and AI and creativity, and they dovetail together right? And we're going to be talking about all that stuff14200:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.160The Alliance: more than anybody14300:26:43.160 --> 00:26:53.611The Alliance: we have, right? We all know that. But like I've been slowly, like one's the one's the bottom one's the top. Because, right, that's what I'm seeing seeing for you.14400:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.900JasonTadros: Okay.14500:26:55.300 --> 00:27:03.840The Alliance: Yeah, I like, if you solve the storytelling problem first, st that's how you start onboarding the talent you need right? And14600:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.575The Alliance: if you find the service that just fits the market need right now.14700:27:10.880 --> 00:27:20.872The Alliance: then, you're kind of like, you know. Then you need one salesperson who deals with data centers, and you know what I mean. That's probably findable through an Internet Linkedin, like you know what I mean.14800:27:21.390 --> 00:27:21.960JasonTadros: Bye-bye.14900:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.519The Alliance: The other, and the other.15000:27:25.420 --> 00:27:32.730JasonTadros: Yeah, everyone I know is complicated. I know people in medicine, and you know, children, you know, they all all of that.15100:27:32.730 --> 00:27:43.770The Alliance: Yeah, no, I, yeah. All the hella regulated stuff I like, I I've learned this is from flow work like, where is it? Easy? Where is it hard? You know what I mean, and like15200:27:43.770 --> 00:28:04.320The Alliance: the military seems is really hard because they've got their procurement. It's so long. Medicine is really hard because the barrier barrier big Mega corporations are really hard because blah blah family foundations, on the other hand, are fucking simple.15300:28:04.490 --> 00:28:23.749The Alliance: You know what I mean because there's 1. Just you gotta get the person's attention who runs the fund. And then they got to convince the boss, and it's only 2 steps right, whereas right? How many gate? I always ask how many gatekeepers are in between me and where I need to get to? And do I have the right story. Once I get there.15400:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.049JasonTadros: Good call yup.15500:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.499The Alliance: That's why that's sort of how I think about that. Is that helpful.15600:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.970JasonTadros: Story15700:28:29.500 --> 00:28:39.920JasonTadros: identify the right targets? Yeah. And at the moment everything's been leading to the corporate areas that I'm familiar with, which are giant. Yeah?15800:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.210JasonTadros: Got it.15900:28:41.870 --> 00:29:01.960The Alliance: I'm not saying bad on the giant. I'm saying those are longer plays cool. What's the shorter play? Because I like what it looked like when I was looking at your conversation with Ryan. And what you guys were talking about you, even though it seems like you set up that Hasbro job, and it's probably gonna get offered to you. You might not want to take it.16000:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.569JasonTadros: Yeah, I just finished all those interviews last week. Yeah.16100:29:05.820 --> 00:29:15.589JasonTadros: then. And that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to race to the finish line, but I don't have to make that decision. But either way, I think if I you know.16200:29:16.360 --> 00:29:24.929JasonTadros: I mean we'll see how long I would be there, for. However, it performed. I just gotta look at the contract, and that's kind of what I'm wondering. Yeah.16300:29:24.930 --> 00:29:31.390The Alliance: Got it? Got it? What else what else can we last through left.16400:29:31.390 --> 00:29:38.560JasonTadros: Yeah. Let's see, I can maybe give you a quick update16500:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.810JasonTadros: of anything that might actually be familiar to you. Let's see here.16600:29:42.810 --> 00:29:54.669The Alliance: Well, what I, what I really want to use this with is talking about talking about how the flow triggers are working for you. Have you been playing with your shit to do and shit goes wrong? List might be real clear.16700:29:55.615 --> 00:30:06.889JasonTadros: I'll say my hand drawing, and just sort of that. That type of work for me16800:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.700JasonTadros: is really really tough.16900:30:09.180 --> 00:30:19.089JasonTadros: A for cause I'm I'm I know you tell me not to, and all the different things. But I'm a pretty critical of my my stuff. And just hand17000:30:19.440 --> 00:30:33.880JasonTadros: coordination isn't my my my best but I did create some digital versions of them. Just to go through the process of it. And so you know that17100:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.070JasonTadros: trying to.17200:30:36.880 --> 00:30:53.079The Alliance: Well, so let me let me ask you a question. The whole point of the drawing stuff the 2 or 3. Well, there's a lot of points. One was, learn a different perspective, learned a way to see things differently. Did you get that out of the digital version? Did that.17300:30:53.650 --> 00:31:00.530JasonTadros: I think I did. I think I did. I think I do. I think for me it's like thinking fast and thinking slow.17400:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.139JasonTadros: It took me to look at my week.17500:31:04.755 --> 00:31:07.600JasonTadros: I think slower and just kind of like.17600:31:07.720 --> 00:31:31.580JasonTadros: Understand the progression? At some point it was a it was a funny progression, because it was like Wednesday I was. I was really these systems. Sometimes I don't know if you ever do anything in Python or any of these programming languages, but the versions and the things that change all the time. It just you could be on top of the world the next day. There's updates and just kills it all. So that was really tough.17700:31:32.074 --> 00:31:41.609JasonTadros: And then, basically, Thursday, I kind of stepped away from it, looked at everything connected my family a little bit.17800:31:41.800 --> 00:31:54.839JasonTadros: Friday came back, rewrote it. And that's part of the reason why I missed that as well last week, because I was kind of like in all of those moments. As well as all the interviews that I was trying to like.17900:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.860The Alliance: Watch the recording from last week.18000:31:58.034 --> 00:32:03.199JasonTadros: I don't know if I caught up on the recordings yet. No, I have not.18100:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.240The Alliance: So you haven't done any of this shit to do when shit goes wrong. List work?18200:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.480The Alliance: Oh, no stairs.18300:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.439The Alliance: That's work that I gotta do. Okay?18400:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.840The Alliance: Well, we add, I added in. So18500:32:15.550 --> 00:32:25.540The Alliance: what we did in the class that might be useful to you is one. There's a very I formalized top to bottom, the entire goal setting structure for everybody. So like, if there's any gaps.18600:32:25.540 --> 00:32:25.950JasonTadros: Hmm.18700:32:25.950 --> 00:32:45.410The Alliance: That. That's the 1st 20Êmin. All the way from mission to clear goals. We emphasize that we talked a little about the flow triggers, and we added in a feedback trigger, we gonna be working on feedback this month and next month this month. It was a way. It was a long term feedback exercise. So it's sort of a retro casting where you look back.18800:32:46.020 --> 00:32:57.460The Alliance: Okay, what do I know now that I didn't know a month ago. And why was I wrong a month ago? And then you start creating a list for yourself. The point is, when we get stressed hardware brain18900:32:57.460 --> 00:33:25.837The Alliance: that actually could solve the problems get shut down. So it's good to have an outsource list of what to do, things you learn about yourself in a flow state where you have clear vision and this sort of retro. It's not a long process. It's sort of like, do the exercise in the class. And then, you know, it's just a couple of things to do along the way. I didn't want to overload you guys, because everybody seems to be moving pretty quickly and getting a lot of out of it. So I was like, Okay, I'm gonna see some of you on the 18.th And we're gonna you know. I'll see you on Thursday.19000:33:26.606 --> 00:33:34.740The Alliance: if you have relationship team questions, Annie's the experts will bring up.19100:33:35.267 --> 00:33:36.520JasonTadros: Yeah, yeah, yeah.19200:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.919The Alliance: She's she's and nobody thinks like her. I've never met anybody who thinks like her19300:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.728The Alliance: around these problems. So it'd be cool. But19400:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.994The Alliance: yeah, take a look at the recording, because,19500:33:48.741 --> 00:33:54.020The Alliance: one of the things that you told Ryan is that you wanted, you know, the next advanced practice. And it's there.19600:33:54.260 --> 00:34:13.270JasonTadros: That was that was really for me, and I I don't want to be that guy kind of thing of whatever. But, like I I love all the camaraderie and everyone but they're kind of like interested in in a different sort of place, kind of figuring out where those things are, and I'm more than anything just trying to like balance and slow, and19700:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.709JasonTadros: take off in a in a in a in a solid way. I guess.19800:34:18.350 --> 00:34:23.639The Alliance: I think the truth of the matter is, as far as I could tell, to be like.19900:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.769JasonTadros: Reading it? Wrong? Yeah, yeah.20000:34:25.770 --> 00:34:29.480The Alliance: No, I so so, Jason, what I what I think is this.20100:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.909The Alliance: I think one. I think there's20200:34:34.190 --> 00:34:45.110The Alliance: there's no way everybody's going to be at the same spot in a in a at all. And we wanted a diversity of of people for cross pollination. 2, 3.20300:34:47.510 --> 00:34:52.440The Alliance: We are building an alliance, but there's no way like I kind of figure like.20400:34:52.560 --> 00:35:17.530The Alliance: By the end of this it may be start to solidify a little bit more, but like it takes those relationships. Take a while. So I love the fact that every showing up and building on them. But like that, that's a slow like, think about how long it takes to trust people. Right? We're we're pushing it. But you could only push it for so long, or so hard. And you know, if you're not showing up to stuff, it's hard, you know what I mean. So so there's there's all that stuff20500:35:17.640 --> 00:35:38.920The Alliance: I really am thinking that, like. Whatever this turns out to be, it might benefit from being a much longer program. Like, I'm not. I'm wondering like, Are we all gonna be where we want to be in 4 months or right? Or should this just be an ongoing? You know thing? So those collaborative20600:35:39.050 --> 00:35:49.109The Alliance: bonds form tighter and like, etc, etc. and how could I even do that in a way that would be affordable for you guys and would make sense like there's no way it works.20700:35:50.550 --> 00:35:58.350The Alliance: Well, my thing is, if I do it like if we do it ongoing and everybody's sort of in different spots, it's definitely gonna have to be a bigger group.20800:35:59.025 --> 00:36:06.465The Alliance: For sure, and which means less or no one on one coaching and more group calls20900:36:07.150 --> 00:36:32.900The Alliance: which may work with like more, maybe like same kind of meetups, because they're those are easy and anybody can come. And then, like maybe 3 bigger events a year kind of thing is sort of. I'm like. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. You know what I mean. Everybody's moving like everybody's. I've been talking to people, and it definitely seems like there's momentum across the boards. I haven't talked to anybody.21000:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.900JasonTadros: Yeah, yeah.21100:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.630The Alliance: You know what I mean. It really feels like people are moving. It just feels like21200:36:39.130 --> 00:36:56.154The Alliance: they're wildly different places. And like your research was based. You were chased basically at launch. And you needed, like somebody to sort of go. And you went. And it just clicked for you. And so you're now in this like massive period.21300:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.989JasonTadros: You just said right now today for me, you know. Sort of put me on the.21400:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.020The Alliance: Well, it also, I mean, I think the so I've noticed21500:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.990The Alliance: I'm doing 2 sets of coaching 2 kinds.21600:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.620JasonTadros: Hmm.21700:37:09.900 --> 00:37:16.139The Alliance: One half is folks like you where most of our conversation21800:37:16.360 --> 00:37:23.730The Alliance: it's not really flow coaching like I gave you the information you seem to have run with it like you. You know what I mean. We'll advance it. Watch the feedback that like21900:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.179The Alliance: that sounds like the strategy.22000:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.580JasonTadros: Go ahead!22100:37:28.580 --> 00:37:37.299The Alliance: Tactics feedback. It's like what we're really doing together. And that's what I've been doing with people. So it's funny, because when I 1st started this with people. And we were talking about business coaching. I was like.22200:37:37.590 --> 00:37:49.220The Alliance: I wanna see what it's like, because if you're gonna do anything business out of coaching, consulting, whatever it is. You really have to sort of be able to impact somebody's roi right? And you have to be able to22300:37:49.430 --> 00:38:10.340The Alliance: be comfortable doing strategy and tactics. And let's just see what that looks like, right? And what I'm learning is like with 50% of the people I'm talking to. That's what I'm doing right. The people who are farther along who are probably closer to creative leader status. I'm having strategy conversations with the people who are lower down. I'm having goal setting22400:38:10.340 --> 00:38:31.039The Alliance: conversations with right it seems to be, and and some mix of both with like little flow micro tunings. But it seems like, you know, everybody's sort of taking the triggers and going like, Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good on that. And it's just interesting. I'm sort of fascinated. I'm like, Oh, this is what my22500:38:31.430 --> 00:38:39.049The Alliance: clients actually like are sort of wrestling with on a day to day basis. That's interesting. I like I would have never.22600:38:39.700 --> 00:38:50.670The Alliance: I would have never really thought. Oh, it's the strategy, I mean, of course, I've started 16 companies. Like done a lot of stuff. So yeah, I'd like, I've seen a lot of different strategies, and all I know is like22700:38:51.090 --> 00:39:10.329The Alliance: the big stuff. Always the Richard Branson protect the downside. How do you protect the downside? How do you protect the downside? And how do you keep moving towards the big stuff? Because, as you know, as long as you move towards the big stuff every day and never stop you get there. It happens right? So the question is, how do I buy my pardon me.22800:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.009JasonTadros: That's why I trust you from that perspective.22900:39:13.010 --> 00:39:18.819The Alliance: No, I mean, like the in a weird way. If you could protect, if you could find a way to get it to pay for itself.23000:39:19.780 --> 00:39:25.770The Alliance: and continue to advance the big dream like an hour a day every day. You just don't stop and don't23100:39:25.890 --> 00:39:32.292The Alliance: air. When it happens. It all seems to happen. That is my experience. Right?23200:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.399The Alliance: I you know I like, especially if you're you're not23300:39:39.460 --> 00:40:01.919The Alliance: for a lot of people. They get so caught in the research. They can't. They keep going in circles? They can't. Actually, I see that my wife is the queen of that like they'll research things for 5 years and not be able to like what? And and in my experience, the research is actually almost worthless.23400:40:02.040 --> 00:40:19.050The Alliance: Once you're 6 steps in, because once you're 6 steps in. You're off the you're off the map of everything you've you've like. It doesn't matter. You actually have to learn on the fly like we just had a conversation about data centers, heat and turbulence, right? Which is a probably a really good right?23500:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.089The Alliance: I think maybe.23600:40:20.090 --> 00:40:24.170JasonTadros: Did something recently on it. But yeah, I'd love to be outside.23700:40:24.170 --> 00:40:29.710The Alliance: No, there is so like sent a couple of talks this weekend, and then I should get off the call.23800:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.219The Alliance: I listen to a couple things. I listened to. The fact that23900:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.700The Alliance: the biggest problems you know the government is facing right now is are is like24000:40:39.810 --> 00:40:53.919The Alliance: metals that we can't get from China right? Really big issue. And if we're gonna go to war, it's gonna be over rare Earth metals that we need for like this stuff. We're making right? Or energy24100:40:53.920 --> 00:41:09.860The Alliance: were the 2 things I heard like the real flash points right now are going to be metals and energy. And I was like, well, okay, you've got like, if you're reducing turbulence, you're reducing heat that solves one of those. I don't know how you start applying your stuff to.24200:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.889JasonTadros: I have a.24300:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.840The Alliance: Materials.24400:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.310JasonTadros: No, no, I you why, it's great. I'm just gonna leave this last thing24500:41:17.214 --> 00:41:27.429JasonTadros: I created a a thing that basically converts the waste heat to infrared using a metamaterial. So it gives off a photon24600:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.389JasonTadros: at the right frequency for the heat, and it just24700:41:31.620 --> 00:41:40.219JasonTadros: the certain type of jump that it makes. When you when you heat up the the material, yep, certain type of mix24800:41:40.790 --> 00:41:49.079JasonTadros: that jump can, or to infrared, allows me to capture it into as sort of like a beam or a laser, or something. Right?24900:41:49.580 --> 00:42:13.309JasonTadros: And I had designed this to. Actually, this is going to sound even more crazy, but to beam into space and use space then as the mechanism of storage. And the reason why I beam it into space is because at that infrared wavelength you can actually punch through a hole in the atmosphere at that frequency. It's how the Arabs used to make like ice in the desert.25000:42:13.440 --> 00:42:31.389JasonTadros: but that frequency allows you to basically create a heat sink to space. And with that heat sink, then you can basically create a differential and now you can store away the heat like a battery, and then you can beam it back to earth, converting it the same.25100:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.370JasonTadros: So you take waste heat.25200:42:35.590 --> 00:42:56.379JasonTadros: which you've got a lot of loss in now don't get me wrong. There's a ton of loss in the early sort of versions of this, but it's waste right. And so then the whole idea that you kind of gave me with the last piece of the turbulence is, can I optimize that waste in a better way to get a higher output, and if I can, then it pays for itself.25300:42:59.770 --> 00:43:07.540JasonTadros: And the reason why it's being in space, you, you know, you could just recycle it into the building. Reason for that is this was a Dod sort of proposal.25400:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.209The Alliance: No, yeah, it's it's all interesting. Yeah, I would like.25500:43:12.990 --> 00:43:26.804The Alliance: you know, again, like you have cool tech, find big problems and find the easiest, least gate path of least resistance to start and make a storytelling deck along the way.25600:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.670JasonTadros: Way to be love it.25700:43:29.553 --> 00:43:30.680JasonTadros: Thank you.25800:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.280The Alliance: And probably honestly.25900:43:38.110 --> 00:43:53.020The Alliance: yeah, I would like I would. Well, I would ask myself the following questions, what's the storytelling deck? What is the simplest, cheapest, bootstrappy way to deliver this. So like let me give you, let me give you26000:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.939The Alliance: an example.26100:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.109The Alliance: If you could.26200:43:57.980 --> 00:44:06.270The Alliance: Either you have to take the Hasbro job. If you could get the storytelling part completed and get a salesperson on it who's being paid commission?26300:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.890The Alliance: They go off into the world, dart26400:44:13.070 --> 00:44:31.409The Alliance: it can take a little while so, and all you're doing is getting there. You've got the Hasbro job. Meanwhile, while they're building up their stuff and all, then you have to do is advance towards the big stuff every day right like. That's a lot simpler than trying to find a CEO. The other thing. And the other thing I'm hearing is, if that's the setup.26500:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.169The Alliance: Your wife probably can manage that one like that right like.26600:44:36.170 --> 00:44:42.800JasonTadros: My brother's an Hvac. From Siemens, so maybe he can run sales in that technology and waste.26700:44:42.800 --> 00:44:51.828The Alliance: It's true. Yeah, I mean, like, it's true. By the way, Hvac, technology is another waste heat problem like, there's another like, right like they're talking about another waste heat problem.26800:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.484The Alliance: which is interesting. Okay?26900:44:55.340 --> 00:45:14.930The Alliance: So we've got a good set of next steps. Right? We're we're actualizing around the deck we're strategizing. For how do we protect the downside and create like a small revenue stream with a really small tight team? That sort of drives itself, while you, you know, essentially have to do the other stuff.27000:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.619The Alliance: did it, and I would tell you that once you have the sales deck.27100:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.390JasonTadros: Hmm.27200:45:21.390 --> 00:45:36.000The Alliance: Then it might be the website. Because you're gonna you're gonna need a sales deck. You're gonna need a website with a little more information right? And a way to buy whatever it is kind of thing. And then a salesperson, right? Like it's these are, these are really sort of minimal minimal27300:45:36.210 --> 00:45:41.789The Alliance: steps. And if your wife can't handle that, I I might look for a part time, Cfo.27400:45:42.050 --> 00:45:46.699The Alliance: that you could get for like a couple of $1,000 a month, and sort of like be done with it.27500:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.338JasonTadros: I know a good Cfo as well. He was in New York27600:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.909JasonTadros: for the city of New York at 1 point.27700:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.570The Alliance: Alright good!27800:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.120The Alliance: It doesn't excellent! Next steps.27900:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.180The Alliance: Alright, I will.28000:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.409The Alliance: We see you. We'll see you on Thursday. Bro.28100:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.530JasonTadros: Yes, absolutely.28200:46:02.530 --> 00:46:04.570The Alliance: Good. I'll see you then. Thank you all.28300:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.500JasonTadros: Alright! You too! Bye.
