WEBVTT100:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.580Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh!200:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.690The Alliance: Yeah.300:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.550Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hello! How are you?400:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.939The Alliance: I'm excellent. How are you?500:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.437Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Pretty good, pretty good. I have a lot of questions for you, so this is great.600:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.574The Alliance: Excellent. Okay. So700:00:57.530 --> 00:01:22.239The Alliance: this is really, about your time, the only thing that I want to do first.st Just so I know literally like this is the I want to scale a 1 to 10 answer. So there's a bunch of things you sort of been assigning this creative path finding I'm working on that 4 flow triggers to think about, including the feedback list, the past creative, microdosing scale of one to 10,800:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.530The Alliance: and you know, and the and the sleep stuff, the regular stuff. Where are you in terms of? I'm following the protocol.900:01:29.993 --> 00:01:33.886Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay. So I would say that I am following the protocol.1000:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.876Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But I definitely noticed dips in my ability to get into flow like I don't like. I don't feel like I1100:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.610Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I stopped doing the meditation or the Microdosing with the creativity, like, I seem to always make time for that1200:01:51.570 --> 00:02:02.309Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But yeah, like, I kind of go through these periods where, like, the flow blocks just end up being like, Oh, I just gotta do a bunch of emails, or they just feel scrambly sense.1300:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.240The Alliance: Yeah. Totally.1400:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.029Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And and I find the1500:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.509Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: this month's 1 to steal. The style is harder for me way harder.1600:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.350The Alliance: And the draw.1700:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.130Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. So I'm kind of sitting there. I'm just like, Oh, my gosh, I'll get like one sentence done. And I was like that was kind of painful, but I want to learn it, too. So I was, I'm kinda yeah.1800:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.890The Alliance: It'll really so.1900:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.260The Alliance: This is the one with the most practical benefit in the real world.2000:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.230Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I bet.2100:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.020The Alliance: You. Really it.2200:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.650The Alliance: It is, cause it. Yeah, it's your marketing copy is your every kind of it's about is your ability to write speeches, your ability to stand on. Stay, it's all like all of it.2300:02:39.650 --> 00:03:04.279The Alliance: because if you can steal a style in writing, you can steal a style in speaking right like it's all that stuff you just have to understand. This is how words work. And this is how I take somebody else's stuff and do it for me. That's the that like that. That's sort of the puzzle there. And it'll also train different muscles, creative muscles in the brain. So like2400:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.420The Alliance: I would. By the way, I think you're the only person doing it. I don't know anybody else who's actually trend the most. Everybody is still stuck in drawing. And I'm like, guys, guys, yeah.2500:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.120Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Still do the drawing. Still, I also do the the drawing on days off well and like with the kids, I draw all the time, too.2600:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.579The Alliance: Nice.2700:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.389Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But yeah. And and then let's go to next week.2800:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.789Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, I was gone for a week on another retreat, so I didn't do go ahead.2900:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.230Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Cheers.3000:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.860The Alliance: Okay.3100:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.579Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Locked me out of my routine. So that was kind of annoying.3200:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.530The Alliance: Yeah, one thing that. Well, I think everybody's having same problem with it is an3300:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.589The Alliance: so I think I'm gonna cover it next time is.3400:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.200The Alliance: I have a home protocol and an away protocol.3500:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.810Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No, no.3600:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.580The Alliance: Really different. They're really different, like.3700:03:49.970 --> 00:04:11.499The Alliance: home. Home is home. I do a million things away is when I read away is when I really, I'll go away for 4 days, and I'll read 5 books because I won't. I'll all I'll do is a workout to start my day. A 10Êmin of pasta meditation and my day, and then read every other time.3800:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.080The Alliance: Every other moment I get, because3900:04:15.370 --> 00:04:29.559The Alliance: I know I can look at 5 books and go. Whoa! Do you know how much fucking smarter I'm going to be after I read those 5 books? That's a lot of roi for for my job? You know, I can read an entire neuroscience textbook over a weekend on a trip4000:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.880The Alliance: pretty big deal, or at least half of one, which is4100:04:33.660 --> 00:05:01.060The Alliance: So you can do a lot of that stuff. That's how I think about it. I reduce it. And I I make the reading there because I want the dopamine from the goals right on top of the knowledge. I want the oh, I accomplished my shit, and so I'm still on the program and doesn't. So my motivation doesn't drop, so I don't have what the face you make when you're like. Oh, yeah, I got off my protocol. And then, yeah, so I don't have to do that.4200:05:01.060 --> 00:05:21.559Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, well, and because I think to almost cause. And and I know I think you spoke about this before, too, where it was. So it was a retreat. So I'm with like a bunch of women. And and it's almost like we're what I think would be in flow like a lot, and it was pretty overstimulating honestly at times, and then and then I never sleep. When I go pacific time. I4300:05:21.560 --> 00:05:36.880Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I I just I like I'm for sure, only sleeping 6ÊHA night at most, whenever I go West. And so then I got back, and I slept so much, and I was so groggy during my days that it was almost just like. And then the other thing that happened is this week I have a4400:05:36.880 --> 00:05:52.139Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like a workshop that I'm doing so instead of on my regular. Okay. These are the things I'm doing on, you know, to get towards my high, hard goal of doing this course. I was like, okay, I need to kind of scramble to piece together this workshop. So then it kind of threw me with.4500:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.209Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, kind of feeling overwhelmed honestly, and that was one of my questions. As far as4600:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.799Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like, I feel like I have way too many different things that I do, and I think we.4700:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.230The Alliance: Well.4800:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.360Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But last time too, and so.4900:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.169The Alliance: Yeah, I mean. So so there's there's a couple.5000:06:08.520 --> 00:06:24.620The Alliance: There's a handful of steps here, and it depends on how ruthless you want to be like when we're just like working with people. Ceos, if like, if Rians working with a CEO, by the way, his rule is okay, 27% rule now applies, though.5100:06:24.680 --> 00:06:45.249The Alliance: take shrink your daily workload by 20%. What would that take? So you do that by picking a start time and an end time and sticking to it. And then you have to force yourself to be efficient within that time. That's a really ruthless way to do it. You have to start saying, Okay, I'm gonna start my day here. I'm going to end my day here. How do I do it? What would have to go?5200:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.640The Alliance: I5300:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.250The Alliance: think that is a useful second step. I think there's this. I think there's a thing you do long before you do that. So5400:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.630The Alliance: one5500:06:57.030 --> 00:07:04.999The Alliance: I do. I always do the top 10 list for fun, my 10 favorite feelings in the world. And if it's not on the top 10 list, I never do it.5600:07:05.756 --> 00:07:14.380The Alliance: Why would I? Why would I like? I made a list of my 10 fit. So let me let me give this to you. I don't know how to do it quickly, and I won't take up too much of your time. But, like.5700:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Bye, bye.5800:07:14.860 --> 00:07:22.239The Alliance: I made a list a bunch of years ago. I realized a bunch of years ago that powder skiing in about 8 inches of powder to 10 inches of powder is my favorite thing in the world.5900:07:22.700 --> 00:07:30.670The Alliance: When everything is perfect and completely healthy that nothing gets injured, and we have a normal snow season. I get 7 of those days a year.6000:07:31.090 --> 00:07:45.260The Alliance: so if I have perfect seasons from now to my average, and I die. Never mind the smoking at 82 like a man is supposed to die these days, and let's say I get even an extra couple of years. I have6100:07:45.610 --> 00:08:04.859The Alliance: roughly 212 powder days left in my life, and I have a chart that shows that. So I know that. So I have a list of my 10 favorite feelings in the world. Skiing is one laughing with my best friend is to, you know, blah blah! And I literally like, if it's not on that list.6200:08:05.130 --> 00:08:30.610The Alliance: I say no, because why? My time is so limited. I want to feed my soul maximum. So why say yes to anything? 11 on doesn't make sense, right? I kick something off the top 10 list like, Oh, I'm sick of this. I'm gonna move this on. But like, you know, I'm I'm literally not like I. So that's 1, 2. I look at everything that I'm doing. And I say, where do I want to be in 3 to 5 years.6300:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.980The Alliance: What is moving me in that direction? What isn't? If it's not moving in that direction, it goes.6400:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.820Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, yeah, I feel like.6500:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.800The Alliance: 3. I'm just gonna say this very, very quickly.6600:08:42.809 --> 00:08:43.449Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: For sure.6700:08:43.450 --> 00:08:51.529The Alliance: You do not want to join Andy's Andrew Huberman's lab. I see what you're trying to do. I love it, and that's smart, but you don't. He's6800:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.390The Alliance: one is very strange. There are pretty women6900:08:54.610 --> 00:09:21.449The Alliance: so like, I'm just saying that between me, you and the wall, because you're actually thinking about this. He's he has a mixed track record with friends of mine. They wrote an article about it like that article was, I was a hit piece on Andy, and I was really mad about it, but he also has, like I've seen that behavior, and I think he's confused, and I would be a little as like I would look at you and go. I don't know.7000:09:21.650 --> 00:09:33.849The Alliance: I don't necessarily like one I don't know, and you don't want. You don't want to have that problem later, because it's annoying, even like to. He does vision research. And that's really what his lab is about. He doesn't.7100:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.280The Alliance: He talks about. And truth of the matter is this, Stephanie.7200:09:40.080 --> 00:10:08.599The Alliance: I have been doing this work for a long time. I've quoted everybody I possibly can quote in my articles. I've cited one Eberman article ever now. It was big, and it was on, and he his lab did it. But it's not. His name is not on the papers, so whatever he's writing. I've literally never seen a paper. He's never come across my desk ever. My point is, I don't think he's the guy like if I was. Gonna now that said that said7300:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.140The Alliance: what what I really started to wonder is so7400:10:16.060 --> 00:10:36.079The Alliance: notice, I don't know if you want to go to New York because I wouldn't want to. But George Bonanno is the world's leading expert on resilience and adaptive flexibility. He's a psychologist in New York, but he's interested in the neuroscience, and I've had flow conversations with him, and he agrees that flow is the best way to train this stuff so like maybe that you know what I mean. Like there's.7500:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.110Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: There's other.7600:10:37.110 --> 00:10:52.759The Alliance: Possibilities I've got like, if it comes like, if you really want to get a you know what I mean like, that's a conversation we want you to have on the phone with Michael Menino. Who knows? Right? Like I and I, you know, whenever you're ready to have that conversation, I'll just set it up7700:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.070The Alliance: for you.7800:10:54.660 --> 00:11:06.849Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because, yeah, that's the thing, because that's what I thought I liked what human was, because, like, he does seem to blend like the science with like the spirituality which is very much what I like, and then just even how he likes to bring it to like the general public, which is kind of what I wanted to do right with that.7900:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.149The Alliance: Yeah, I'm just saying, I don't want. Let's be really clear on something.8000:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.575Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.8100:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.369The Alliance: Nobody in Andy Eberman's lab but Andy Eberman gets famous.8200:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, I don't really need.8300:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.809The Alliance: He doesn't share.8400:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.410Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. Go ahead.8500:11:20.410 --> 00:11:37.549The Alliance: I've no, this is something else I know secretly about Andy. Andy. Andy has been. He likes to go into other people's communities and bring them into his community, but he doesn't share. He doesn't play well with others, and so we have a very hard time playing with him, and he's the8600:11:37.650 --> 00:12:04.187The Alliance: literally the most irresponsible person I've ever met. I can't like. He doesn't return phone calls. He's literally like everybody knows this. Even my friend the Navy seal who works with you and like he doesn't. He's so like I would he'd be the last guy I'd want to work. He's he'd be a he could be a disaster for a career. So you don't want to go there. There's there are a bunch of places you probably do want to go and8700:12:05.510 --> 00:12:14.067The Alliance: in a bunch of different directions. You know what I mean like depending on depending on on who, what or where? So8800:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.319The Alliance: And if I get my way and confined8900:12:21.690 --> 00:12:34.230The Alliance: 100 million dollars to do what I want to do, you could come to the University of Reno in Nevada and get a degree in advanced performance neuroscience, which is what we're trying to do. But it's not. It's not yet. Yeah.9000:12:34.535 --> 00:12:34.840The Alliance: Oh.9100:12:34.840 --> 00:12:44.369The Alliance: we're we're we're. Gonna I think we're gonna have that. I mean, I have to. I have to raise a lot of money because I want to build a high performance lab with a wave pool attached.9200:12:44.370 --> 00:12:44.880Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.9300:12:45.100 --> 00:12:53.469The Alliance: So I could actually do this work the way I've always wanted to do it. So it's a big price tag. But I want to do it in Nevada. I wanted to, you and I. So you know.9400:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.379The Alliance: 100 million dollars.9500:12:56.510 --> 00:13:04.289Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, you gotta get the vet corporations involved, and then we can train all the veterinarians, and that'll be good for the vet corps.9600:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.889The Alliance: Well, we're starting with Pt.9700:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.420Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Interesting.9800:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.260The Alliance: We're starting with it. I gotta start with the dod thing and do it and do it. Really.9900:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.900The Alliance: it doesn't matter. All right, let's do your questions. Let's do your questions next.10000:13:16.111 --> 00:13:22.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, no. And and that's really good advice. Because I think I was kind of like, you know, yeah, kind of or similar, right. And that's where, like.10100:13:22.040 --> 00:13:41.290The Alliance: Yeah, I just want to stress that we're similar. You're making a smart decision. You're saying I need a Phd advisor who's media savvy? And right it could help that way. My point to you is in my experience, those kind a lot of people that way are very covetous of those contacts. They don't share.10200:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.670Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right. It's fun.10300:13:43.670 --> 00:13:56.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Media savvy like. I don't know if if that's quite it, it's more so. The blending the science with like the psychology, with the spirituality, with maybe even like the consciousness studies like, because all those things I find very10400:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.859Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: interesting and kind of the solutions I.10500:13:59.860 --> 00:14:09.990The Alliance: Depends on what level of rigor you want to play. You know what I mean, like, what level of rigor you want to play, how much math you want to do. There's a bunch of questions that you know.10600:14:10.610 --> 00:14:20.557The Alliance: If you want to go flow and physiology, you would go to our friend Micello's lab at Florida lab like we like. A lot of these people are friends of ours as well.10700:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.185The Alliance: So10800:14:24.870 --> 00:14:42.550The Alliance: There's the entrepreneurship school at Usc. That our friend Glenn Fox is actually a neuroscientist in the world's leading expert on. Gratitude runs so there's like way there's other ways to sort of like, cobble it together. It's really about like, what do you exactly want? And then we can figure that out like this is10900:14:42.870 --> 00:14:54.660The Alliance: like, yeah, like, this is not gonna not gonna provided you test. Well, you certainly work on paper. You know what I mean. Like, you're gonna I think we can get you into a neuroscience program. Not a problem. Right?11000:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.890Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So, yeah.11100:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.219The Alliance: And I gotta tell you something.11200:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.180The Alliance: I think you're kind of crazy to not look at Mcgill.11300:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.120Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, okay.11400:15:03.120 --> 00:15:14.499The Alliance: Because it's fucking Mcgill like they, I mean, like Wilder Penfield, like the birth of altered States. Neuroscience is Mcgill like Wilder Penfield was Mcgill.11500:15:14.750 --> 00:15:40.900The Alliance: you know. Yeah, he's he's a legend, and and he's the guy who figured out that. Oh, you touch the spot in the brain. You can provoke memories. No, you can provoke out of body experiences. No like that was. It was Penfield's work that led to the creation of the god helmet, which is nonsense. But the God it does sort of work, and transcranial magnetic stuff came out of that which works even better. And blah blah, so like there's there's a really, there may be a little clinical for what you want to do.11600:15:41.450 --> 00:15:41.790Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Like, when.11700:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.600The Alliance: Knows where they've gone lately, but like11800:15:43.750 --> 00:15:54.050The Alliance: you're in Canada, and I was just like, well, you know, Mcgill Mcgill has a long tradition here. Of this stuff. So it's worth thinking about.11900:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.630Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.12000:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.279The Alliance: There's other. Yeah.12100:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.350Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, no, that sounds so good. So maybe I'll get like, super more specific, because I kind of started looking. And then.12200:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.679The Alliance: I want. Yeah, I want, I wanna know, what I need to know is like.12300:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.429The Alliance: and this is before I put you on the phone Menino, because let's not waste his time12400:16:09.950 --> 00:16:21.680The Alliance: specific as possible. So like, ask yourself questions. If you want to do cutting edge flows research. That's computational neuroscience. If you really want to do the crazy, computational cutting edge flow research.12500:16:22.710 --> 00:16:39.000The Alliance: it's possibly Richard Husky, Uc. Davis who we write papers with. But he's in media studies and focus on video games. So we're like, would he have any interest in doing something? Your way is an open question, and he's not going to be open to this spirituality. Flat out like I, I know.12600:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.930The Alliance: like that's not a conversation I would even have with Richard, or like for your shit.12700:16:45.130 --> 00:16:58.330The Alliance: Andy Newberg at Jefferson is probably great. My mentor. He's an amazing human being, is one of the 50 most popular neuroscientists in the world. He doesn't have a great12800:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.750The Alliance: tree. If you end up right working with him, he's you're gonna do all the work.12900:17:03.367 --> 00:17:15.059The Alliance: But like literally like his books on, I mean, he defined the study of the neuroscience of mystical experiences. And he's a Jefferson center for integrative medicine. So like vet stuff13000:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.071The Alliance: like, you know what I mean?13100:17:19.380 --> 00:17:33.487The Alliance: But he may have left, and he may now be in Florida. Running a startup. I gotta figure out where he is and what his position is before I. But there's a there's a bunch of people like you know what I mean, that like that that are really interesting.13200:17:33.770 --> 00:17:47.409Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, cause maybe to like I could see myself going a couple of angles. And this is where I'm kind of like, well, I'd like someone to be like. Yes, that would be a really good one, or write some feedback on it. So maybe what I'll do is just like put together kind of 3 things, I'm thinking, or something. And then.13300:17:47.410 --> 00:17:53.980The Alliance: I want, like, I want all this stuff, you're thinking. But I also want to know how much math do you want to do? How much chemistry do you want to like? Where.13400:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.460Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.13500:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.929The Alliance: Gonna have to do neuroscience. So what tools do you want to work with? Do you want to work with Eeg? What's.13600:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.830Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, like, I, want each.13700:18:00.830 --> 00:18:08.719The Alliance: Gotta think about, how do I transfer this like, transfer this to bets? Do I want to take this to the animals themselves?13800:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.200Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. Hold on.13900:18:10.200 --> 00:18:17.270The Alliance: Just start answering those questions for yourself. Right? I mean, our healing product. Our healing protocol is based14000:18:18.170 --> 00:18:28.910The Alliance: around a a bunch of I mean, we get 5 to 6 extra years in dog's life, but putting them into flow states, feeding them really high quality food, getting them regular dentals and giving them14100:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.870The Alliance: acupuncture and sort of that kind of preventative care. Law, I mean, like our dogs fucking, live for14200:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.679The Alliance: and hike for up like. That's the thing we did. We developed a longevity protocol for dogs.14300:18:40.680 --> 00:18:50.210Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: This gives me idea, because I'm talking to Bruce about different things with for animals. And maybe that's what we need to do is like an Hr device or so like an hr.14400:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.920The Alliance: I've got.14500:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.950Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Your your dogs to see.14600:18:52.950 --> 00:19:03.669The Alliance: I've got a whole list of pet products that I want Bruce to make. So my, here's the other. This is my secret goal, secret goal, secret, conspiratorial me, and you only talking golf.14700:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.040Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay.14800:19:04.040 --> 00:19:16.829The Alliance: I want a private airline that is pot friendly and dog friendly and flow friendly. So you get like little cabins around the edge and in the center you get a shared dog park and a pot and a weed bar.14900:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.269The Alliance: You'd have booze there, too. But I want the weed. I want a pot friendly15000:19:24.970 --> 00:19:34.090The Alliance: weed friendly dog, friendly airlines. You could walk on with a joint and a dog like a civilized human being.15100:19:34.276 --> 00:19:34.650Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That way.15200:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.060The Alliance: What's so fucking hard about that.15300:19:37.950 --> 00:19:53.740Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that'll have to be in your top. 10 list feelings. That's super cool. Okay, that's super cool. Okay. One big thing I really wanted to ask you was, okay. So you're saying, like coming back to that like, yeah, like, top 10 list. So what comes to mind when I think of that is15400:19:54.540 --> 00:20:18.389Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: because I was so burnt out, and I still feel a little bit like I have this hesitation like, I've kind of enmeshed the experience of like really working hard, going hard and like being really excited and like, really in the creative zone with then it being like, okay. But then it's gonna really suck. You're gonna get burnt out. And you know, feel miserable, basically. But yeah, like, as far as I don't know any advice there's like, because I.15500:20:18.390 --> 00:20:29.530The Alliance: One thing, I was one. Yeah. One thing I was looking at, looking at your schedule and looking at in your notes, and I was just. You may be doing this already. We may have talked about this. You talk to your husband about like15600:20:29.970 --> 00:20:35.450The Alliance: having nights off, where you can go to sleep earlier where you don't have to15700:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.749The Alliance: do kid duty in the evening.15800:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.709The Alliance: so you can regularly block recovery a little bit more.15900:20:42.550 --> 00:20:56.109Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Just like well, I mean, just like the way our house is laid out, like the rooms are all beside each other, and I hear them either way, and it's not that like cause. Now what? I've been going to sleep around 11, and then I'll I'll I'll sleep to like 7 if I can.16000:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.110Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: and I'm like I've been sleeping way better, and they're gone during the day.16100:21:00.110 --> 00:21:07.710The Alliance: Do you use a do you use like rain, rain, or any of those things? Oh, yeah, white noise, app of some kind.16200:21:07.710 --> 00:21:13.489Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, like, there's white noise. And like, yeah, like, sometimes, I'll take valerian route like I like, I don't take a lot of sleep Aids, because.16300:21:13.490 --> 00:21:24.559The Alliance: Oh, if you want so the best sleeping one, if you need it, that it is all natural for sure. Without a question, mode plus method. You gotta order directly from them.16400:21:25.065 --> 00:21:31.439The Alliance: Yeah, mode and method. It's because the best indicator of a good night's sleep is Hrv, so it's specifically.16500:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.900Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: You know.16600:21:31.900 --> 00:21:40.340The Alliance: It was built for Hrv, so it's it's essentially Cbd Cbg.16700:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.349The Alliance: Numeric cucumin and black pepper and a couple of other things. But like16800:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.240The Alliance: it's the mo like I can't.16900:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.630The Alliance: I use Benadryl for years until they figured out it's gonna cause Alzheimer's right. And I was like, Oh, I can't.17000:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Emancipated.17100:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.079The Alliance: Oh, that's interesting! Never did that to me.17200:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.979The Alliance: I only like every now and again.17300:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.680Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: You are using.17400:22:05.680 --> 00:22:18.439The Alliance: Again on the road. What you know, what it did do for me, though, is it kept? I overloaded my histamine system, and I didn't know, because I was taking it for so many years when I stopped taking it. I'm now like17500:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.949The Alliance: so susceptible mosquito bites.17600:22:20.950 --> 00:22:21.560Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, yeah.17700:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.420The Alliance: Like all that stuff.17800:22:22.420 --> 00:22:35.819Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Liver. Detox. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, that's hard. Okay? Yeah. Cause I think that's kind of my thing like I like, I feel like my active recovery is there? But sometimes it's more just. The excitement about doing anything at all is.17900:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.719Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: What I feel is missing. So when you say, like a top 10 list.18000:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.440The Alliance: Oh, I see!18100:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, God, like, yeah.18200:22:40.850 --> 00:22:45.010Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And then then, even if something came up on the list, I might just be like, Yeah.18300:22:45.010 --> 00:22:56.809The Alliance: By the way, I like. I do that too, but it also one of the other reasons I use that list is, I realize that when the opportunity to do something on that list comes up, I need to try to say yes.18400:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.659The Alliance: because I'm gonna fucking die like I'm gonna die.18500:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.090Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: You know.18600:23:02.090 --> 00:23:22.229The Alliance: I'm literally going to die, and if I don't choose to make the memories, no one else is going to do them. That's the other reason I have the list. So it reminds me that laughing with my best friend is a super priority, right? And I need to make time for that, or, you know, having.18700:23:22.450 --> 00:23:30.739The Alliance: you know, Experience XY or Z are like, Oh, shit! They're on my top 10 list. I gotta pay attention right? So18800:23:32.400 --> 00:23:50.762The Alliance: That is another thing that I think about, too, because I can very easily forget to edit out fun and flow from my life, and that like the fastest way to burn out is to not have a double, not be doing your primary flow activity once a week right.18900:23:51.130 --> 00:24:07.920Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's what I don't do either. Consistently, I don't cause my probably the only thing I can consistently get into flow doing is playing piano like it's the easiest for me. But I probably play it like yes, some weeks I'll play it a few hours a week, but then I'll go like months without it.19000:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.000Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So I probably need to do.19100:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.990The Alliance: Yeah. So if you so let let me just put it to you in really simple terms. If you don't want to burn out19200:24:16.940 --> 00:24:28.570The Alliance: you, you wanna like you have to be feeding curiosity on a regular basis. You gotta be reading and learning. You gotta be reminding yourself that life feels great.19300:24:28.930 --> 00:24:34.943The Alliance: So you have to double down on your you gotta double down on your primary flow. Activity right? And19400:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.750The Alliance: those sorts of things.19500:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.840Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.19600:24:41.340 --> 00:24:47.422Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And I think there's still something that I'm working on with myself that I've somehow paired.19700:24:49.260 --> 00:24:58.439Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, it's almost like, yeah. Cause I am really curious. But then sometimes I'm like, I don't have time for this, anyway. And I'll just get like. And it's like, almost like this, yeah.19800:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.870The Alliance: Well, one of the I mean one of the things that like, I think, is true. So19900:25:06.380 --> 00:25:16.170The Alliance: as long as you steadily progress, the goal is what the question is like being able to look back in 5 years and being like Whoa, look what I did right you!20000:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.840The Alliance: I would like to see you do a little less a lot better.20100:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.520The Alliance: I really would. I like you're trying you're at, because when you came in20200:25:27.900 --> 00:25:52.640The Alliance: like you were trying to grow that business and do a bunch of stats thing. And now you're like going for a neuroscience degree. And you know what I mean. And I'm all for creative pivoting. And I knew there was going to be a lot of that inside the Alliance, because you can't do this kind of work without something going. Oh, wait! I was a little off. I was a little. That's why I always say, like purposes are directional. They're not fixed.20300:25:52.640 --> 00:26:00.650The Alliance: Our goals are fixed purposes are directional because you're gonna actually wiggle right to to as the trajectory. It's an evolving.20400:26:00.850 --> 00:26:25.900Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, no, for sure, because I definitely had my neuroscience train, like more like whether it was a Phd. Or whatever I had that on my list for a while, but I didn't see until we talked last like how it could go together with the other stuff I'm doing, and then, like the vet clinic like like, that's what makes us money. So that's where, like, yeah, honestly, I would probably almost like to sell it. But I mean, I own it with Dave. And it's like20500:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.579Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: it's just hard. Yeah. Cause even this past week, like I spent I don't know how many hours looking at20600:26:30.700 --> 00:26:44.180Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: clinic drawings, because we're adding a second clinic. And then it's, you know, which I actually really love doing that. So it's kind of. But I don't like the rest of it, because I also have to hire like a human resource manager. And, you know, hire like a hospital system team lead. And20700:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.720Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: so like that stuff I don't like doing, which I'm doing less and less of, thank God.20800:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.540The Alliance: Yeah, I like, it's very clear to me that, like20900:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.429The Alliance: you have to get out of that job.21000:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.109Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And again.21100:26:58.110 --> 00:27:08.879The Alliance: I mean, like you, really, I mean, like, every time I talk to you, you're like, there's this big chunk of my time that is spent essentially being an operations manager.21200:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.350Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, like.21300:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.080The Alliance: Right.21400:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.130Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Sure, but more and and like I don't.21500:27:14.880 --> 00:27:33.410The Alliance: May not, you know. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't look at you and go. This is a woman who's going to be an operations manager. You know what I mean. Like, I literally like I I think the only reason you probably are a good operations manager is because you're a good mom. And you're drawing on your mom skills.21600:27:33.410 --> 00:28:00.389Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Not even a good operations manager. But I'm really good at noticing what needs to get done. And I think that's where like, that's how I'm creative is is, I'm is I? Yeah, like, I look at like, I'm just really good at being like, Hey, this is the whole organization. And I can zoom out. And I'm like, this is what we need. And then I zoom in and with a high attention to detail like this is exactly what needs to happen like when everyone else is going nuts. I'm just like, Okay, everyone stop. And it's like, it's this, like, this is what you need to do, not this21700:28:00.750 --> 00:28:15.529Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: over here, and like like, that's what I do. Well, and I haven't found anyone that can do it as well as me. So then sometimes it just comes up and I'm like, No, stop like, this is where you need to like focus. And then it's like, Oh, yeah. And then it like everything ripples up from there. And so like, that's where21800:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.760Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I don't really think I'm good at actually doing the operations management. I'm just really good at the problem, solving.21900:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.040The Alliance: Okay.22000:28:23.690 --> 00:28:37.029Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So. But at the same time I'd like I'd be okay to not do it anymore. And and like, I honestly given up a lot of it, and then they kind of make some mistakes, and it's only like really bad when it comes to me. But they also do it really well like, you know, good enough to do it.22100:28:37.030 --> 00:28:45.180The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, that's all I was saying is like that stuff looks like undoubtable forever. Okay, so we've got a few minutes left. What else can we blast through.22200:28:45.800 --> 00:28:56.029Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, sorry. There's a list of here. Yes. Cause it was. Yeah, the over. Yeah. So I guess, like, that's the other 2 thing, too. So when you are22300:28:57.070 --> 00:29:21.210Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: kind of coming back, yeah, because I came back from this retreat, and then it was like I was so tired, and I felt kind of low, just because I think it was like a lot of different things. And then I felt behind. And then it was like the kids. And then, like, I thought I was going to work on this stuff. But I had to do the clinic stuff. And then I also was like, Yeah, I have to prepare for this workshop that I said I do. And then I just get kind of, and that just comes down to like that like the shit list.22400:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.400Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: and then, like the chunking down right to get into the flow zone.22500:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.620The Alliance: 2 or 3 things, the one22600:29:29.240 --> 00:29:35.130The Alliance: this is the second or 3rd time you've told me you come back from a trip and gotten creamed. This is a pattern.22700:29:35.373 --> 00:29:35.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I could.22800:29:35.860 --> 00:29:57.069The Alliance: Come back from trips and get creamed as well energetically. So I know, for example, that the day after a trip I'm actually gonna feel good. When I come to work I'll be energized. But I have no reserve. So I'm gonna get overwhelmed very early on in the day, because there's 0 reserve, and everything's gonna stack up. And I'm gonna freak out right.22900:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.260Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, and then.23000:29:58.260 --> 00:30:09.659The Alliance: The second day is totally fucking miserable because I don't sleep right. It's really terrible. And then I start getting my shit together. On the 3rd day. The one thing I do is I allow myself23100:30:09.950 --> 00:30:25.190The Alliance: get an exercise day to give myself an extra day. I don't love it because I don't feel reset until I go to the gym, but I can't. If I do that it pushes everything too far over. I have no reserves left, so I cut.23200:30:25.190 --> 00:30:43.890The Alliance: I've cut a lot of things out of my schedule. My team is trying to work really hard to let me recover for a like a full day afterwards, but I won't like I don't like taking a full day off, so I can't do that. It doesn't like, you know. I would have to like schedule a massage or do like I'd have to live in some way that I don't normally live. It'd be weird. But23300:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.960The Alliance: What I'm saying is, you know that about yourself. So the question is.23400:30:49.190 --> 00:31:06.800The Alliance: I now get way out ahead of my work before I leave on a trip, because I'm like, oh, I'm gonna come back overloaded. And there's gonna be like 6 fires that I can't see now. So I actually have to get out ahead of next week's work. So like23500:31:06.860 --> 00:31:29.729The Alliance: I was on a crazy deadline with my novel to get to the Alliance event last week because I knew the novels due tomorrow or Wednesday. I knew it. But I was like, I got to get 90% of the way through because I'm gonna have, I'm gonna lose. I not only did I lose a couple of days to exhaust it, we had a wildfire, so I lost another day to a wildfire.23600:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.115The Alliance: so23700:31:31.810 --> 00:31:39.750The Alliance: But I knew it was coming. And so I'm now. And the the main thing about that is, and this is what you're not yet doing. So23800:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.800The Alliance: over time. If you really just immediately come back from the trips and try to kind of go in back to the routine and just23900:31:46.980 --> 00:32:00.300The Alliance: get it up. You'll notice that you get the results you want. You're getting farther faster. So it's gonna get less stressful. But right now, as you're coming back from your trip and all those things are true, and then you're beating yourself up for it.24000:32:00.300 --> 00:32:00.620Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: To you.24100:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.240The Alliance: Do you feel.24200:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.401Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I'm like. I may as well have taken the day off, because I just kind of sat there like, oh.24300:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.550The Alliance: Yeah, and the other.24400:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.020Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Didn't like.24500:32:07.020 --> 00:32:13.830The Alliance: Here's the thing that I do is when I am actually crushed like when it when I'm like, Oh, I'm fucking overloaded.24600:32:14.010 --> 00:32:41.239The Alliance: I'm done like I'm out like I make sure that I can like cause there's nothing good is going to happen from that point forward. I just have to like expect it. I expect to be depressed, I expect, like I don't take it seriously. I don't make decisions. I try not to have a serious conversation. My wife. You know what I mean, like, we have protocols in place where we're like, okay, we're gonna avoid each other for about 24Êh after a trip, because I'm not safe.24700:32:41.400 --> 00:32:47.999Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, and and then do you just kind of distract yourself through that kind of dip, like, I, just all agree.24800:32:48.000 --> 00:33:01.009The Alliance: No, I. So I can usually write really well, so I could put about 3 or 4Êh of focused work in then. I I go for like low grade exercise, so I'll take the dogs for weight vest hike.24900:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.590Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.25000:33:01.590 --> 00:33:09.351The Alliance: To wait vest time, and I'll go for a long hike with the dog. So I get. I get that. It won't be too tiring, but I so then I25100:33:09.790 --> 00:33:15.470The Alliance: I'll draw and read, and Sauna and.25200:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.330Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.25300:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.470The Alliance: You know.25400:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.750Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, double. Down. Like, active.25500:33:18.750 --> 00:33:36.081The Alliance: What I yeah, what I do is I'll I'll what I wanna do is I want to be like, Okay, this is gonna happen, I got to overload. So I have to totally shed stress. That means sauna meditation, creative microdosing good night's sleep, because otherwise it's gonna cost and snowball. And I don't have time for that.25600:33:36.907 --> 00:33:50.010Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, cause I, yeah, like, yesterday, I talked to Dave, too. I was, like, I feel, like, we need someone to manage like, help us manage the household, even because or even maybe I just hire someone to cause like, even today, I'm like working on slide decks and whole like 4 months.25700:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.740The Alliance: Here's the here's the other thing.25800:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.799Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hire someone to help.25900:33:52.800 --> 00:34:07.490The Alliance: Yeah, here's the, here's the cause. I could say this to you. I wouldn't say this to most people. So I I have a rule, basically, which is, and you gotta figure it out for yourself. But I know, for example, I can sort of work my ass off for 2, 9 weeks.26000:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.919The Alliance: and if I've gone 9 weeks without, like a deep break26100:34:13.060 --> 00:34:25.786The Alliance: and restorative, I either got it like, and it's not ski season ski season. I use skiing to reset. But if it's not ski season and I can't go surfing or do like one of those things.26200:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.799The Alliance: that's when I'll actually do psychedelics.26300:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.399Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, got you!26400:34:29.409 --> 00:34:33.159The Alliance: What I'll use is I'll use it because I need a vacation. I don't care about the trip.26500:34:33.159 --> 00:34:33.869Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes.26600:34:33.870 --> 00:34:48.080The Alliance: The day after, because I won't work. I'll take the day after, because I know I'm rushed, and I take the day after I force myself to take that day off, even if I just sit around watch TV all day book on watch TV all day. Even if I do that, I don't care, but like.26700:34:48.159 --> 00:35:06.180The Alliance: so I like. I force myself to reset, and there's only a handful of experiences like that's also what was good for the top 10 list where I'm like, okay, I can. This is the social experience I can use to reset. This is like, you know, blah blah. So26800:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.559The Alliance: like I you. I think you gotta really get out ahead of your burnout.26900:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.020Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.27000:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.400The Alliance: It's right at the. It's right at the edge there, and active recovery27100:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.980The Alliance: is good. The you know, the creative. All those things are good. The flow stuff is good, but like27200:35:23.260 --> 00:35:33.030The Alliance: you gotta slim your schedule down enough that you can buy yourself if it's piano time like whatever it is. You need a little more of the27300:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.669The Alliance: I feel good inside.27400:35:37.410 --> 00:35:43.779The Alliance: Otherwise is otherwise. What are you working for? Cause? It's really when we all, when your dreams become a prison.27500:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.490The Alliance: the only way to get out of it is to remind yourself why you love life.27600:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.010Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No.27700:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.070The Alliance: You know.27800:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.580The Alliance: you could send the kids away. You could do a bunch of like crazy drugs with your husband and have wild sex all weekend.27900:35:58.490 --> 00:36:05.989The Alliance: That's 1 way you know what I mean like. But you gotta do. You gotta do one of those things where you're like. Oh, I gotta remember, I'm fully alive. I gotta like.28000:36:05.990 --> 00:36:16.159Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And like with the kids, too. And I think that's the thing like I love doing. I love traveling with the kids. That's why, even I wanted to ask you. And we're probably over. But like whether the mountain hood thing was happening. Because, like, that's the kind of stuff.28100:36:16.160 --> 00:36:25.910The Alliance: Oh, the back, right? So yeah, I gotta. I gotta call Ryan right now and yell at him. I don't fucking. Understand why what his, his damn problem is. We're going to Mount Hood28200:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.519The Alliance: on the 17th and 18, th I believe, is when we're going might be the 16.th28300:36:31.135 --> 00:36:39.120The Alliance: But I think it's the 17th and 18.th We're also gonna go, if you want, in Chicago on the 11th of August, we're gonna go see Lincoln Park.28400:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.899Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. Chicago. Nice.28500:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.771The Alliance: And and then28600:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.729The Alliance: on this coast, just because I have to be there. I'm going to be in La on in28700:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.819The Alliance: September. So I told people I'd have dinner if they want to have dinner on September 3rd before New York.28800:36:53.186 --> 00:36:54.839The Alliance: Because I just have to be in La.28900:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.409Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Chicago's better. It's nice and close same time. Zone. Yeah.29000:36:58.410 --> 00:36:58.800The Alliance: Yeah.29100:36:58.800 --> 00:37:07.591Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's the kind of stuff I love doing is just like traveling with my kids like, I love that like, I love going on adventures with the kids and exploring new places, and just.29200:37:07.850 --> 00:37:20.439The Alliance: I mean. Come, you know what I mean. Come on, get get the dates from. I'll get Ryan to get every the dates. Put it on the Whatsapp group or whatever. But get like it. Just get it, you sort of29300:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.659The Alliance: you'll you'll you're gonna need to rent a car. You need a card. Hood.29400:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.629Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that's fine. We fly into Portland. I kind of lost. We fly into Portland.29500:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.300The Alliance: Yeah, you.29600:37:28.300 --> 00:37:37.839Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Drive up, and then we would go to the coast and probably drive maybe down like to Salem, and then we kind of looked up and back up to fly to Portland to like 5 days. We probably come that like.29700:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.359Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, I'd have to look because I have to be back on the 20. Second is the only thing.29800:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.380The Alliance: Yeah, it's a. It's dope country.29900:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Of course.30000:37:48.860 --> 00:37:58.243The Alliance: So yeah, it's it's really beautiful. It's Hood itself is is gorgeous government campus. It's fun. Your kids will really love it.30100:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.019The Alliance: it's just.30200:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.560Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, well, they love, they love it.30300:38:03.560 --> 00:38:11.830The Alliance: Yes, like they love skiing. And they're literally gonna get to ski and see like you're gonna get to stand next to the train park and watch30400:38:12.010 --> 00:38:22.029The Alliance: Olympians throw quadruple, silly stuff. You know what I mean? It's just like it's like the show. Besides, the skiing, the show is just like, are you kidding?30500:38:22.180 --> 00:38:29.089The Alliance: Yeah, I don't know if anybody I know is gonna actually be in Hood. Everybody we know is there this week.30600:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.279The Alliance: or having a baby.30700:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.890Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, it's fun!30800:38:34.090 --> 00:38:35.210The Alliance: The fuckers.30900:38:35.664 --> 00:38:42.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I'm so glad. Okay, sounds so good. Thank you so much. That's awesome. Yeah.31000:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.664The Alliance: And I I don't. Last thing I want to say to you is31100:38:47.870 --> 00:38:56.270The Alliance: It may not look like it, or feel like it exactly from the inside. Because acceleration31200:38:56.860 --> 00:39:08.399The Alliance: often doesn't feel like acceleration early on, because it can go in a lot of directions at once. Sometimes, like you make a lot of progress in certain things, and then, like other things, just sort of31300:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.739The Alliance: you like you know what I mean.31400:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.370Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.31500:39:11.370 --> 00:39:19.629The Alliance: That's what happens when you amplify creativity. That's what happens when you start thinking critically about mission like this is my point to you is.31600:39:21.840 --> 00:39:30.349The Alliance: unless this is the way you normally are. This looks really like normal, like good, normal, solid progress to me like this is why.31700:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.250Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay. Good.31800:39:31.250 --> 00:39:46.609The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, like, you have, like, I said this in the beginning, and people didn't believe me because nobody believes me. When I say things to them, I said. It's a creative velocity accelerator. And along the way we're gonna turn up creativity, which is, gonna turn up your emotions.31900:39:46.610 --> 00:40:04.348The Alliance: And right, because it makes you more both and and more empathetic and flow. Does that and all like all this stuff is going to happen. And we're going to give you a little more flow, which means more dopamine. So like you're the roller coaster is bigger, and you haven't yet learned how to stabilize it32000:40:05.070 --> 00:40:11.420The Alliance: And all those things are like, of course. Yes, you know what I mean.32100:40:11.420 --> 00:40:11.920Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So.32200:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.069The Alliance: From the out and and like, and it from the outside, like there's there's like.32300:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.030The Alliance: I don't know if there's 15 people in the alliance. I want to say, like32400:40:20.330 --> 00:40:40.559The Alliance: 7 or 8, energetically. I didn't notice it until I was talking to you, and I was like, Wow! You feel like Courtney like the same energy with where she is right now. You have same thing with wit, like there's people I can point to where I'm like, Brian like it's sort of like a32500:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.750The Alliance: it's a crystal like it's a weird crystallization acceleration, you know.32600:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.310Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm! It's like 8.32700:40:47.754 --> 00:40:54.859The Alliance: Well, it's not angst. It's like it feels like angst. But what it really is is32800:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.279The Alliance: so much of life is exactly figuring out what32900:40:59.550 --> 00:41:06.899The Alliance: kind of like, what shape you need to fit into like? What's the exact? What's the fit right.33000:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.710Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.33100:41:07.710 --> 00:41:29.550The Alliance: How do I build a life? So it really fits my strengths and the directions. I want to grow it. And you know that sort of stuff, and until you start one, you you start learning about flow and people form which you don't like the possibility space. You don't know how big. It is right. So you've got a limited ceiling. And suddenly you meet me and you meet groups like this. And you're like, Oh, wow! The ceiling is a lot bigger.33200:41:29.550 --> 00:41:48.860The Alliance: But okay, interesting, cool. So like the upper canopy. Just got a lot bigger. And that's interesting. And we're turning up creativity, which means your ideas about how to inhabit this new adjacent possible are firing in all directions the same time we're giving you good goal, directed frameworks to help you.33300:41:48.870 --> 00:41:59.510The Alliance: Oh, it exploded out here. Here's how narrow it back I floated. Here's how I narrow it back. This is just what like I've been in a creative velocity accelerator period. For, like33400:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.609The Alliance: the past 2 years.33500:42:02.240 --> 00:42:31.370The Alliance: it's Matt it was. It's awful until like the past like month, when the things that have been developing are like coming to fruition, and I'm like, Oh, the books are gone, the papers are coming. The like social medias were like all this stuff is working. And now I get to like. Now it actually feels fine. But for 2 years it felt awful, and you just have to not care and keep going, but you can't not care and keep going until you do this work for long enough to believe that it's gonna work.33600:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.070Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right.33700:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.619Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I can't convince.33800:42:33.620 --> 00:42:48.940The Alliance: Right. You got to see it work for yourself before you're like, Oh, wow! Just I just keep doing the checklist, and I get where I want to go. Like. That's the lesson. But you have to prove it to yourself, and like once you prove it to yourself a couple of times you're like, Oh.33900:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.699The Alliance: oh, this is how you do those impossible things. It's not.34000:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.280The Alliance: It's nothing outside what I'm capable of. It's just this. But.34100:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.700Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.34200:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.100The Alliance: At the front end of that34300:42:59.520 --> 00:43:24.314The Alliance: you don't have any confidence. You get like little bursts. Oh, I see more flow, or I'm a little happier a little, whatever, right? Like you see stuff. But it does. It's not yet stable. And you know how long. It's funny, because, like, I I know we're gonna like, you know, we'll find out because we're measuring it. But well, I like flow numbers are going up. I could tell tell you to people. Probably not huge yet, except for a couple of people. But34400:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.739The Alliance: it hasn't yet34500:43:30.870 --> 00:43:51.869The Alliance: like everybody's more on the roller coaster than like, because what you once you're on the roller coaster for a while you start to go. Oh, don't ride the highs too high. Don't take the lows very seriously right, and you start to be able to respond appropriately. But right now flow is so delicious you ride the highs all the way up, and then you get too tired and too excited, you know.34600:43:51.870 --> 00:44:11.849Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Frustrating to stop, I found, and this is where, like, before I got super burnt out, I would get into like a flow state, working on something with a clinic. And it was it was painful to stop. And I would basically. Yeah, I would just ride it for a few days, and then I would crash. And but then I was so high functioning anxiety, it worked until it didn't. Oh, my God! But yeah.34700:44:11.850 --> 00:44:40.849The Alliance: Yeah, it's yeah. Like, if you're, I have pretty strong like Ocd tendencies. So like, once I get on task, it's really hard to get me off task and I don't like it, could I? We were like I don't know what I was trying to do. The other day I was exhausted. I was trying to pack for a trip, and somehow I got was like folding my T-shirts and my T-shirt. You know what I mean like doing the total Ocd thing, and I was like halfway through the door. And I was like, Stephen, what are you doing like you like? The job is to like pack for the trip.34800:44:40.930 --> 00:44:51.340The Alliance: Like, really like, really like this, like, what are you doing? You know? I you you gotta sort of monitor for that anyways, I should go.34900:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.090Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay. Awesome.35000:44:53.386 --> 00:45:02.890The Alliance: We will. I will see you next week for the kickoff call, and I'll get Ryan to get you the shit you need. I'm gonna go yell at him right now.35100:45:03.702 --> 00:45:04.429Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No, it's good.35200:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.470The Alliance: Loud. I'm gonna yell. I'm a.35300:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.100Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Extreme, as you can tell.35400:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.059Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, I can tell. You're very angry, hard to work with, I'm sure.35500:45:14.180 --> 00:45:42.560The Alliance: Well, most people can't handle the speed. By the way, like, I'm very easy to work with. But most people can't handle the responsibility to speed. So we're gonna we're gonna talk a little about how to. That's the the next class. One of the things I've done this for a couple of people already, because people have asked, people have been like, How do I get my team? I'm moving at speed. Now I'm moving faster. How do I get my team to move a speed and there's there's no great answers for that. But I like35600:45:42.900 --> 00:45:52.231The Alliance: I do have some kung fu there. You know what I mean like this is what I do. And I laid it it was talking to. I don't know who I was fucking, talking to somebody asked me35700:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.060Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, wow!35800:45:54.200 --> 00:46:03.089The Alliance: Kim Crow asked me how I did it, and he was like it was all news to him. And I was like, really okay, like I was gonna sort of teach this around group flow. But like.35900:46:03.200 --> 00:46:11.000The Alliance: we're gonna teach less of the group flow stuff. Because we're just we're gonna focus on feed book again this month. We're gonna give you guys feedback buddies. By the way.36000:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.050Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But it's gonna be.36100:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.689The Alliance: More work. Yeah, yeah.36200:46:15.070 --> 00:46:19.699The Alliance: we'll tighten down the collaboration, this one that because now you're halfway through. And you guys trust each other enough.36300:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.090Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: We can see.36400:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.729The Alliance: Sort of assign you feedbacks. What are you gonna pair it to other people?36500:46:23.990 --> 00:46:30.250Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, cool. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, that's cool. Cause I did actually do some feedback with like another group. I mean, I'm like, let's do some like like, actually.36600:46:30.250 --> 00:46:39.873The Alliance: Yeah, we're we're we're gonna we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it here and cause we're gonna start to try to figure out what's your minimal feedback for flow? What's the best kind of feedback you need? And36700:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.210Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's so good.36800:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.829The Alliance: Yeah, I think the best kind of feedback you need is somebody who reminds me to chill the fuck out.36900:46:45.830 --> 00:46:52.780Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And and then just to be like, Yeah, that's good. And I'll be like, okay, cause I I have trouble still, kind of trusting myself.37000:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.500The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, like.37100:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.049Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Want it to be really good.37200:46:57.050 --> 00:47:05.490The Alliance: Yeah, you like. So the the role that chase plays on my team. So I I37300:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.749The Alliance: because I move fast and I'm a perfectionist.37400:47:09.950 --> 00:47:20.270The Alliance: I need somebody on my team who moves fast and is an expert at not making the break the enemy of the good. So Chase moves really fast.37500:47:20.420 --> 00:47:20.830Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.37600:47:20.830 --> 00:47:45.450The Alliance: His quality suffers. Ryan is really fucking slow, but he nails the quality most of the time. So I have Ryan. Look at Chase to make sure he stays on Brand. And that's how Chase moves really fast with all the stuff that has to be really fast like the marketing emails. And if you give it to me, I'm gonna care too much. It doesn't. I like, I literally like.37700:47:45.480 --> 00:48:05.780The Alliance: people don't need me to write a perfect email to buy a class. They want to buy the class. They don't actually need the fucking, perfect email. But I'm gonna spend days on it. And it's not even going to be as effective as Chase. They're like, I have a guy who does the stuff that I need to have invested. And I got another guy who polices the guy who goes fast37800:48:06.410 --> 00:48:28.119The Alliance: with my standards. That's that's 1 of the ways I sort of do that. There's certain roles you have to hire for speed, and there's certain roles where you're like is slowness. I can use to my advantage right? Because Chase will go too fast, and it'll break the brand. Not right, just a little too fast. It'll break the brand. But if I make him pass this stuff through the filter of Ryan.37900:48:28.120 --> 00:48:28.940Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.38000:48:29.620 --> 00:48:38.620The Alliance: Ryan just will, through a review process, can say Yay or nay, this is on brand. This is off. It doesn't like it works right. So that's how I anyways.38100:48:38.870 --> 00:48:43.059Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, no, that's perfect. That's awesome. Okay, so good. Thank you.38200:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.360The Alliance: Bye, you're welcome!38300:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.370Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Bye, okay.
