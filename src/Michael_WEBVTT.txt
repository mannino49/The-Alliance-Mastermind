WEBVTT100:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.633Whit: Is he?200:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.420The Alliance: Good to see you.300:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.790Whit: Good to see you.400:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.697Whit: How are you.500:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.660The Alliance: Where's my damn pen?600:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.370The Alliance: Had it? I had my good plan.700:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.986The Alliance: I guess I lost my good fan somewhere. Alright. So800:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.190The Alliance: let's jump in. Because, I wanna respect their time. And it's limited. And this is900:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.930The Alliance: 95%. Gonna be your time to focus on what you think is most in front of you. But before we get there.1000:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.749The Alliance: one of the reasons I love the1100:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.099The Alliance: the fire hose approach to learning that that is, that is a a class that I teach is1200:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.780The Alliance: because by about about now.1300:01:59.920 --> 00:02:26.209The Alliance: bunch of shit has stuck bunch of it has sort of evaporated fine. But a bunch of stuff has really landed, and I always find that, like those emotional allows to do this in my writing, and how you should structure learning. But I you know. So I think about it. So what? You know what was like, immediate, actionable, punched in the face that you just immediately were like, Okay, I'm getting after this, you know, this was this, this really helped.1400:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.359The Alliance: or or or maybe nothing at all. And and you you wasted your time and your your money, and you know this is an entirely different call than I expect.1500:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.490Whit: No, yeah, so I've totally changed my daily routine. You know, particularly during the week. So I1600:02:41.780 --> 00:02:57.179Whit: now you know I I it resonated, that you're closest to flow when you 1st wake up the the Alpha theta interface. So what I've done is, you know, I used to. I'd always get up early. 6, 6, 15, start my days. But I would. Typically.1700:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.459Whit: you know, grab my phone from the kitchen, you know. Maybe check some messages, things like while I'm getting my coffee and getting a little snack. And then I'd go into my office. And I typically started my days with1800:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.860Whit: you had kind of like1900:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.849Whit: for lack of better term. Clear my email, like, I have various things that come in newsletters, things to read like I would kind of start my day2000:03:17.120 --> 00:03:37.679Whit: slowly, with some of that knowledge gathering and I've done a few things. So one I you know I the only thing when I wake up now that I check my phone for is emergency messages from my elderly parents like I just, you know, I'm like, all right. No no text for Mom and Dad. Good, we're like. And then I leave the phone plugged in which, if you if you notice the2100:03:38.150 --> 00:03:50.010Whit: the drawing assignment that I put in, which I don't know if you've checked out the uploaded ones. But I I Urban, sketched my kitchen command center where the phone plugs in at night with the phone plugged in. And so that's the that's the story.2200:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.789The Alliance: Is that not the most? Is his? Is Toby loose sketch not the most fucking fun. Am I wrong.2300:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.470Whit: This is my sketch of.2400:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.840The Alliance: Oh, dude! See!2500:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.189Whit: The kitchen with the phone plugged in and the little space. And it's like.2600:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.709The Alliance: Yeah, yeah.2700:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.850Whit: It's symbolic of the change to my morning. And then I go into my office, leave the lights down low.2800:04:12.010 --> 00:04:37.309Whit: so I'm usually in there within 15 min of waking up, and you let the dog out. Feed the dog, get some coffee, eat a couple of nuts and a bit, you know, piece of banana like I like to have a little food when I wake up and then I spend the first, st you know legitimately. I can get about 45 min to an hour of undistracted time in the morning. Now, the only thing I check on email is, I have Chat Gpt. Deliver me both a curiosity drop2900:04:37.480 --> 00:04:56.819Whit: and a thing to advance. The idea that I, some of the Mtp. Stuff that I've been playing with in the space and the curiosity. So I have, like a couple of topics where I have it. Send me a new nugget around those topics each day that could potentially spark the like. How do I reenter3000:04:57.510 --> 00:05:14.789Whit: the area and go like some days? I know where I want to reenter. And some days I'm like, Okay, I'm just. I'm reserving the the non time for no one space, and I want to explore it. But I like having that little bit of a of a queue, but I don't. I? You know I don't deal with any of the rest. It's a quick. It's a kind of a quick little hit3100:05:15.130 --> 00:05:25.049Whit: entry, so that's 1. That's how I've kind of rewired the early part of the day. And then I'm consistently every day when I'm not traveling writing3200:05:25.200 --> 00:05:38.180Whit: on my whiteboard in my office clear goals for the next day. At the end of the day. I used to track stuff in Asana kind of, but like I find writing on the whiteboard, and then having the act of crossing it off the whiteboard when I finish it the next day3300:05:38.270 --> 00:06:02.669Whit: gives more of the dopamine hit and the momentum. And one of the things I'm playing with in general, in my like Mtp. And interesting space is the concept of earned dopamine versus cheap dopamine, and how you know that the benefits of moving more towards an earned dopamine approach or dopamine economy coming off of the the buzz of the cheap dopamine that social media and the screen based. Economy has been driving, and I find.3400:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.279The Alliance: I should warn you. Language wise. Just so, you know.3500:06:07.920 --> 00:06:36.299The Alliance: literally, we get dopamine every second of every day, because it's constantly like, if our error correction software doesn't detect a violation. In reality, we get a little bit of dopamine. So like it's you have to be a little like people use those terms really fast and loose. And it's not like anybody's wrong, right? It's nobody's wrong. It's just that it's really fucking like psycho way, more nuanced in terms of like3600:06:36.300 --> 00:06:53.508The Alliance: what that actually, maybe. And it's also like we got dopamine for movement. And we got dopamine for pleasure. And you know, 6 different dopamine receptors, and I'm not saying bad. But I am saying that when you start to language it that way, especially when you're talking to clients right? It's going one down the chain.3700:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.154The Alliance: yeah, you just want to be a little bit like, especially if they know anything about neuroscience. Now, because dopamine is so popular.3800:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.640The Alliance: I see pushback from people.3900:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.080Whit: The the, you know. It's a good point to play with the language, the the concept still of the like.4000:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.840The Alliance: So you're totally right. You're totally right about everything.4100:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.280Whit: How do you know how you're gonna start?4200:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.950The Alliance: Talking about.4300:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.219Whit: Yeah, no, I appreciate.4400:07:16.220 --> 00:07:25.810The Alliance: I like. I see where I know where it's gonna go. I like. And I was like, Okay, this is great. I like everything you're doing and I hear how you're gonna language is. Let me just give you4500:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.449The Alliance: no, I appreciate it.4600:07:26.862 --> 00:07:28.100The Alliance: Yeah, that's all.4700:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.240Whit: Cause.4800:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.789Whit: The broader, like4900:07:33.630 --> 00:08:00.979Whit: space that I've been playing in is around the you know, the parallels of the the social media lost generations of you know where we essentially, whether it's social media, whether it's screens in schools or these things where we've run mass experiments on people without a general sense of what the impacts are going to be. And we're running another one with AI right now. And and the general concern is that if we don't structure or think think thoroughly about how you5000:08:01.369 --> 00:08:10.870Whit: set up people of all generations to collaborate with AI in ways that elevate human creativity, mastery and grit, it will erode them like the default state will be to erode those 3 things.5100:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.920The Alliance: You know. I mean, by the way, you're you're you're stealing my thunder from the next class.5200:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.602The Alliance: Yeah. So shut the fuck up.5300:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.720Whit: Design, like.5400:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.909The Alliance: I I get to talk about this stuff in class.5500:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.849The Alliance: Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you exactly.5600:08:26.150 --> 00:08:37.969Whit: And it was interesting going through the parallels of like, you know, infinite scrolling and algorithmic addiction to cheap AI assistants that give you the easy answer and dull curiosity and deep work, right or highlight, real culture.5700:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.280The Alliance: I actually think it's worse than all than anybody anticipates, because5800:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.392The Alliance: social media unleash mental illness, right period. That's what social media did.5900:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.530The Alliance: this is much sneakier, because it will6000:08:52.790 --> 00:08:58.750The Alliance: literally erode creativity. It will erode intelligence like it will literally eat your brain.6100:08:58.910 --> 00:09:12.840Whit: And it'll it'll like, take away the desire for mastery right? If you think AI can always do it better like, why do you ever pursue mastery and everything, and going deep? If you just think that the easy answer is out there, or the grit to do it, or the problem solving when the easy button is like.6200:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.230The Alliance: The Google effect for AI boy.6300:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.030Whit: A lot of different ways.6400:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.909The Alliance: Agree with that.6500:09:17.910 --> 00:09:39.249Whit: Culture was one that we were playing with. That I thought was interesting of like Instagram and others. You see the best version of everybody else's life. Well, the AI's arts always better than your art. If AI is writing is better than your writing, why try right, like you know, at what point does it erode the that pride in your own flaw potentially flawed output, or even the pursuit of more mastery of that output?6600:09:39.250 --> 00:09:49.820The Alliance: So it does 2 things. So this is, there's a double edged sword here, and this is the sort that other people don't see it like. I have this argument all the time with Peter Diamandis, which is6700:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.970The Alliance: AI. So6800:09:52.840 --> 00:10:20.329The Alliance: people think AI can write better than they can like. They like, which it probably can in a lot of cases. But it is not a good writer from a writer's perspective. When, like you look at AI, it, the output is dreadful, and we now recognize the pattern. So we tune it out because we know it's not made by a human in the way. Same way we tune out the message from Zimbabwe about the guy wants to give us money.6900:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.030Whit: Right. No, but it's not7000:10:23.518 --> 00:10:28.450Whit: it is not a good writer to those that have mastered writing to some degree.7100:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.700The Alliance: Yeah, no, I mean, that's so. That's what I mean. Like.7200:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.040Whit: Kind of.7300:10:31.040 --> 00:10:52.999The Alliance: All sides of this. It's not just that it does the deflation which you're talking about, but it also sets a false like it's a fake target. It's like, yeah. And I mean, and what's happening is to good writers. We're seeing the uncanny valley effect. You know what the uncanny valley is a robot that's too lifelike.7400:10:53.000 --> 00:11:13.599The Alliance: too human, like we see a robot that's too human like. And it's slightly flawed. It actually produces revulsion, instant revulsion. It's the gross out response. It's known as the uncanny Valley. We're getting it from. AI produced stuff. Now we see stuff that's machine made. It makes us feel a little queasy, and we don't know why.7500:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.068Whit: Yeah, no, that makes sense.7600:11:18.030 --> 00:11:41.329Whit: and you know, the other thing that's going to be so much worth with AI, right is like social media was largely in your leisure time. AI is going to be everywhere like it's getting infused into everything. You're not going to have the escape, whereas social media. Maybe you broke from work to do it, but it was still actively like it was not some places. AI, that's going to be really hard to avoid with AI. So you've got the exponential pace of introduction and the inability to escape from it.7700:11:41.350 --> 00:11:49.969Whit: And then the thinking through of like, how does that impact multiple generations. You typically think generational of like school kids coming up, which clearly, that's an area of like, how do you not?7800:11:50.040 --> 00:12:18.070Whit: How do you not end up with an exponential decay in the creativity of. We already see an age wise decay of it. How does that echo exponential with AI as the kids come up. But you've also got the corollary to the social media moms, right? The people that like the moms that went on Facebook and stopped interacting with their families, and like in engaged over there, like, there's going to be the people at home. And how does it infuse in the home life and interact with or interfere with family engagements and the exploration and imagination at home. And then there's work7900:12:18.070 --> 00:12:26.089Whit: and the like pursuit of mastery and the ability to like the current workforce, to make that transition in a productive way, and8000:12:26.230 --> 00:12:43.000Whit: stay motivated and gainfully employed and other things. So it's like, like, I think of 3 generational buckets. It's like school and the kids coming up. There's like work and the employees, and there's like home and families, as all of which have8100:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.220Whit: significant risk of being lost.8200:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.660The Alliance: This is the this is the. This is the thing you're trying to advance. This is our8300:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.450The Alliance: frame of the masterpiece in a.8400:12:53.450 --> 00:13:03.120Whit: Yeah, like, how do you shape a future? And where people of all generations can collaborate with AI in ways that enhance creativity, mastery, and grit not erode it.8500:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.830Whit: and.8600:13:03.830 --> 00:13:09.120The Alliance: Is this? Is this a book, a course, a.8700:13:09.120 --> 00:13:16.960Whit: That's what I'm not sure yet, like. There's a few ideas on the what like you could go raise a venture fund that.8800:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.869The Alliance: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is, yeah, exactly. Yeah.8900:13:19.870 --> 00:13:30.780Whit: Invest in companies that promote flow science and AI that is scaffolded to encourage grit and exploration and mastery. Or you could.9000:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.470Whit: you know, come up with a competition that's like.9100:13:33.690 --> 00:13:33.910The Alliance: Right.9200:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.010Whit: All right, so.9300:13:35.010 --> 00:13:41.480The Alliance: Good now, alright, so so I will. I will. It's interesting.9400:13:41.870 --> 00:13:55.490The Alliance: You know. There's we're we're gonna cover this again. and this is also. If I would have known now what I what I would know, I would have done what I'm like the the goal setting stuff that we're gonna9500:13:55.530 --> 00:14:19.989The Alliance: sort of do next month at the start of this whole thing, like, I think that's where I would just start. But one of the exercises. I've got a lot of people running. I don't. I'm not so concerned about you with the 1st step of this, because you don't know where you're going yet. But here's how I want to give you a little more frame system, an easy frame here. So one, I usually tell people, is like, once you have your high, hard goal. You don't have a high, hard goal yet. You've got your.9600:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.550Whit: I've got a space of interest.9700:14:21.810 --> 00:14:31.269The Alliance: Yeah, you got a space of interest that's crystallizing, and I love that. And I think you've got the right approach, and you're letting it breathe? Once you get the high art goal.9800:14:31.545 --> 00:14:54.669The Alliance: what's the like? What? What's a hundred steps between where you are and the achievement like layer? And all this stuff, you know. You know, there's gonna be a marketing phase, you know, there's gonna be a production, right? All that stuff. So get yourself a hundred steps, and it's usually like way more than a hundred. But, like the whole point of that, exercise is, never get blindsided by what you're what's about to come, because that's how you lose all your motivation.9900:14:54.670 --> 00:14:59.489The Alliance: Yeah, because what people do is they're like the line that says, Okay, figure out the marketing for the book10000:14:59.490 --> 00:15:19.000The Alliance: we'll figure the barking, for the book is a year long project that involves a hundred $1,000, and like a huge team, and like no, it's not all like. And so you get there, and you haven't looked at the 50 things it is. You're demotivated. But if you know what the 50 things are they just become items on your clear goals list? Then it's just a question of what comes next. Right? So10100:15:19.000 --> 00:15:29.979The Alliance: you're not there yet. But there's a second layer of filtering that I always find useful here, that everybody leaves out for the equation, which is the really simple one, the fuck. Do you want to do.10200:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.380Whit: Yeah.10300:15:30.380 --> 00:15:55.288The Alliance: Right like, what are your strengths? What's really fun for you? What plays to your passion? You know what I mean, like, you wanna like the business like. Wherever this goes, you don't just want it to go there. You want it to map onto exactly who you are. People make this mistake fairly frequently. And I'm not. It's weird. There's probably a cognitive bias or something that has us doing this.10400:15:55.973 --> 00:16:07.470The Alliance: it's the same thing that allows us to be creative like, you have to be super naive, the front of end of any creative project to like get it off the ground right? You can't be realistic. And I I sort of10500:16:07.690 --> 00:16:14.399The Alliance: people assume that. Oh, I've got this big mission level purpose. It's totally aligned up. Now I'm going to be a different person.10600:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.230Whit: Right.10700:16:15.230 --> 00:16:43.499The Alliance: Well, no, actually, you're you're not. That's not like you might get to be more of you. But you will definitely not be a different person. You're not. If you're an introvert, you're not gonna suddenly because you have an extra like a big dream. You're not suddenly gonna wake up and be like, Oh, yeah. And now I want to speak in front of a thousand people every day, for like no, that's right. So one of the things that you could do along the way towards your incoherent target of is10800:16:43.670 --> 00:16:51.809The Alliance: start figuring out exactly what are like. These are my invisible skills that I love like the the, you know. So you can start.10900:16:52.300 --> 00:17:10.159The Alliance: People tend to think of those things as limitations. In a sense like, I want to be this kind of if you were an engineer, though that's a boundary condition. You're just describing the boundary conditions of a system that you engineer inside of. So I'm saying, use use yourself as like11000:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.279The Alliance: set of preconditions that will help filter this. That might. That might be a useful next step.11100:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.740The Alliance: Step. It's sort of like a passion filter.11200:17:17.890 --> 00:17:24.230Whit: Yeah, I've started to think about that to some degree, you know, particularly in the last few days. Like I,11300:17:25.300 --> 00:17:33.000Whit: I tend like my biggest strength is, I'm a multiplier, right? Like I'm really good at taking.11400:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.260The Alliance: I was. I was division myself, really, but.11500:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.010Whit: You know I'm not necessarily a like create from scratch11600:17:41.330 --> 00:18:08.879Whit: is my biggest string. I did it once. I did my startup, but like that's not my I'm not wired to like. Go start 3 different businesses from scratch and go over that. Take the huge risk like, put my family's finances and security on the line. Like all that kind of stuff, I am really good at multiplying, of like taking getting in with ideas, making them better, figuring out how to take potential and turn it into progress. And so there's things of like whether it's11700:18:09.000 --> 00:18:21.370Whit: the fun type concept where you're like, you know, go engage with a bunch of different companies, not just as in financial year, but in a studio type thing, where you're helping to take the AI solutions that they're building and turning them into ones that11800:18:21.410 --> 00:18:36.860Whit: promote the future. That I want to see versus not, you know, going in the other direction, or a big foundational company like a thinking machines. Lab right Mira Marathi, that from open AI that's supposed to be all around human AI collaboration11900:18:36.860 --> 00:18:59.189Whit: to advance science to these other things where, like, they're not talking about a lot of this stuff like they're talking about. They're not talking about like, how would you bring some of the flow science principles into it. How do you create an environment that that advances mastery and grid and and creativity? They're more like, how do you use AI and humans to advance scientific progress right? But but a company that would potentially have massive scale12000:18:59.440 --> 00:19:06.509Whit: to touch a lot of different places could could influence generations like either of those feels aligned with kind of12100:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.370Whit: who you know my12200:19:10.170 --> 00:19:21.009Whit: who I am. To some degree. There may be some others, you know, like I I put down some business ideas of where you would go. If I did that I'd have to feel pretty confident to take the financial12300:19:21.370 --> 00:19:26.680Whit: leap of going into startup phase like I'd have to have some real funding, and the right people with me if.12400:19:26.680 --> 00:19:41.010The Alliance: Yeah, and I would. I mean I would all I always tell tell you on that stuff like always, always, always fucking nights and weekends, man nights, and we start with nights and weekends. Don't fuck with your safety and security nights and weekends.12500:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.970Whit: That's the way I operate.12600:19:41.970 --> 00:19:42.510The Alliance: Yeah.12700:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.050Whit: Fully aligned.12800:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.399The Alliance: Fully. Yeah. Bootstrap the entire. It's got to pay for itself.12900:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.120The Alliance: Yeah. Well.13000:19:48.120 --> 00:19:59.029The Alliance: at a certain point, it's got to pay for itself. And it's gotta work. It's gotta work nights and weekends. And it's only when it becomes like, truly, financially viable that that I will let it actually compete.13100:19:59.840 --> 00:20:10.330Whit: That was one of the questions I had for you, who started so many businesses is like, where do you like? What is your moment that you shift from being like I'm playing with something to be like. I'm chasing it more fully.13200:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.406Whit: For nights and weekends.13300:20:12.810 --> 00:20:18.229The Alliance: Like it all. So usually to me it's a number.13400:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.305The Alliance: I mean, like, literally like the Alliance was13500:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.424The Alliance: when it actually was the so13600:20:30.360 --> 00:20:53.860The Alliance: somewhere around 20 customers for the year. Is like the break even. I haven't gotten paid, but pretty much everybody has gotten paid, you know, like on my team and my tech stack, and like like. So I was. So the to me it was. This is until we hit that threshold. I was just committed to a 4 month thing13700:20:54.433 --> 00:21:18.899The Alliance: to check it out to see if I like it, because, right and you know, it was, it's a lot of time. But ultimately, I mean, I'm still writing 3 books, and you know what I mean. Like, I've gone skiing a little bit. You know what I like. I'm not. My life hasn't been completely mortgaged to the alliance. It's just it's and I've and I've and because I tuned it so well for whom I am.13800:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.829The Alliance: Everything is fueling me. It's not like I hang up this phone call, and I'm like, Oh, God!13900:21:24.850 --> 00:21:48.600The Alliance: That took my fucking soul. You know what I mean. Like none of that. It's all like I hang up this vocal. I was like, oh, that was so cool. I learned this this and that you know what I mean, and I'm fired up a little bit. So that's how I think about it. I think about it. I want it paying for itself. I want it fueling itself right? Because I want to get through like, cause it's gonna like, it's a business14000:21:48.600 --> 00:21:58.630The Alliance: you fucking. Know, it's gonna get hard like the unexpected is gonna punch you in the mat like all that stuff's gonna happen. It's a business. So like I look for all the like.14100:21:58.680 --> 00:22:19.790The Alliance: It's gotta be financially solve it. And really like it's gonna take care of the future. So I don't have to, because I'm worried about how my staff's gonna get paid over this next, I can't freestyle and do my shit. I gotta get my staff paid. You know what I mean. Like, yeah, okay. So I look at, I really, I go a lot slower than other people. I'm very cautious about taking anybody's money. I don't like. I did it14200:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.690The Alliance: once, and I don't think I'll ever do it again.14300:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.719Whit: My Bootstrap my startup with just money from my dad, right like I didn't take anything.14400:22:26.720 --> 00:22:36.824The Alliance: Yeah, I like, I I mean, I've done it. And I did it for all the right reasons, with all the right people and all this stuff. And it's still like,14500:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.899The Alliance: yeah, it's still like we brought people in in my in my life. One of my older companies were like.14600:22:43.230 --> 00:22:48.779The Alliance: Okay, if we have this guy and his money, we don't ever have to hire a Cfo14700:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.380The Alliance: you could have, and like that made sense.14800:22:52.380 --> 00:22:52.770Whit: Yeah.14900:22:53.160 --> 00:23:03.019The Alliance: Until we reached the limits of his knowledge, and then we got into problems that he had never fucking solved. And I was like, oh, now I like now I've got to pay you and hire. It's like, Oh, fuck!15000:23:05.025 --> 00:23:05.730Whit: Yeah.15100:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.100The Alliance: Up.15200:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.773The Alliance: Okay, so15300:23:11.410 --> 00:23:21.800Whit: One of the ways I'm approaching that right now is, I'm trying to set up a dual architecture where a lot of the stuff that I'm interested in. I can bring into my current job and work environment to the benefit of the the work generation.15400:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.489The Alliance: That's yeah. That's what I was. Gonna say, is, it sounds like you've got this incredible15500:23:26.990 --> 00:23:37.219The Alliance: spot right now, where you can test anything coming out of your brain and like, is it a workshop? Is it a book? Is it a movie? Is it like15600:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.899The Alliance: right? Exactly like you could go anywhere with this fucking thing, for sure.15700:23:43.900 --> 00:23:59.219Whit: Yeah, and I've done a lot of it. I'm very comfortable in workshops. I haven't really gotten into the. I would love to do more. Speaking like I'm an introvert, but I love to speak and and talk. I haven't really figured out the path to. It's hard to break. It's a little hard to break into the like.15800:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.830Whit: you know, keynote speaker bringing in unless you've done it because you can't show the others like I can go do workshops because.15900:24:04.830 --> 00:24:18.779The Alliance: Yeah, it doesn't. I like, I mean, if if so, what if that stuff is of interest that like I can tell you how to do it. It's a lot longer and slower than you realize, and the thing you have to understand is16000:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.900The Alliance: you're getting into an arena where, like16100:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.030The Alliance: like, we are. The money is huge16200:24:26.260 --> 00:24:41.780The Alliance: and there are not. This is like, there are a lot of jobs. But like, there's a lot of competition. So people like. It's a thing it's not like. You don't just sort of waltz into speaking, and like you can waltz into speaking and occasionally make $5,000 to show up and like16300:24:42.190 --> 00:25:00.880The Alliance: there's a way. And we could. I could tell you how to build towards that. But if you want to actually start making real money speaking. The competition is insane, and people have armies, and like you're playing social media. You're playing a lot of games. I don't necessarily know if you want to play right like.16400:25:01.090 --> 00:25:14.130The Alliance: which is neither here, here. There's other ways. There's other ways to walk, walk, walk in that way. But I would tell you you want. I mean, like more than anything else you want to walk into the expertise of this stuff that you're doing anyways right. And16500:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.550The Alliance: that's how that's how you do it. Tag16600:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.750The Alliance: alright! Tell me, what? What are we up against? What can I help you solve.16700:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.920Whit: I mean, we're we've been starting to explore it. I think, a little bit on the call of like I feel like my16800:25:32.190 --> 00:25:39.920Whit: my space of interest is crystallizing much more than it was at the start like this. Talked about it with my wife.16900:25:40.280 --> 00:26:01.190Whit: you know. I think it's a shared passion of this concern of what happens to these generations as we go into this AI world that is going to erode some innately human capabilities unless we shape it. We still have agency. We still have some ability to do that. It's trying to influence that space. You know. I you know, I have my kids I can influence with my kids. I have17000:26:01.530 --> 00:26:07.649Whit: my work. I can influence it with my work. I am regularly reading some of the papers and trying to get17100:26:07.840 --> 00:26:24.889Whit: up to speed on like the science and feel like I can converse on what I'm trying to do. A lot of is just talk to people about this people that don't know the space to test my own knowledge and to to go deep, whether that's guys on my softball team or people at work, or my CEO or others, and and get into that uncomfortable space of I've got to be able to17200:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.869Whit: talk about it while I'm learning it and test like, when does it? When do they go.17300:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.940The Alliance: Yeah, hold. Okay, hold on, hold on. I'll get a I'll get a17400:26:33.270 --> 00:26:38.240The Alliance: I'm gonna give you one other thing I want you to pay attention to as you're doing this. This is awesome17500:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.610The Alliance: spears.17600:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.620The Alliance: What I want. So what you have to write down.17700:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.600The Alliance: If you test a thing, you're looking for 2 things really? One.17800:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.040The Alliance: Well, 3.17900:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.360The Alliance: One.18000:26:55.060 --> 00:27:02.449The Alliance: Most important engagement like, which stories are they following? Where are you losing them? What is lighting them up?18100:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.530The Alliance: It's the 1st one. The second one is anytime anybody laughs18200:27:07.820 --> 00:27:28.949The Alliance: anytime you actually get a laugh out of somebody. You write down what it was right, and how you generated that everything you need to sort of be able to recreate it, either in writing or on stage, or like you write down the, get the laughs and get the times they started to pay attention and and then18300:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.779The Alliance: the most important thing is always18400:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.680The Alliance: when you're communicating ideas that we care about.18500:27:37.130 --> 00:27:56.610The Alliance: This is the thing that Sarah was talking the other day. And it's really important. When you're doing this sort of stuff, they're gonna be times where you're trying to make a point that's really important to you, and nobody's gonna get it right. It's gonna fall flat. And our urge is to run away from the bad feeling immediately, and get like the good feeling back. So like.18600:27:56.610 --> 00:28:21.870The Alliance: you know, when a comic bombs, the next thing they want to do is reach for the tried and true trusty joke, right? And that's fine, but that's what you want to do is start to lean in when your point bombed and try to figure out. Why did it bomb? Because those are the points you're gonna want to make right? So you don't want to dodge the oh, I fucked that up. You want to go. Oh, I fucked that up cool. Why.18700:28:21.930 --> 00:28:29.639The Alliance: right like, why did I fuck that up? What didn't land? What was your hidden reservation like here.18800:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.640The Alliance: My mom is reading my new novel, and my mom is not18900:28:38.160 --> 00:28:53.153The Alliance: the world's most sophisticated reader. Not bad, but she's not. And it's a complicated metafictional sci-fi extravaganza. You know, it's really got a lot of layers. It's both from 8 different perspectives. It does a thing.19000:28:53.900 --> 00:28:59.689The Alliance: she calls me up. We're talking yesterday or 2 days ago, you know. She really likes the book she's like.19100:29:00.920 --> 00:29:08.870The Alliance: But how come you gotta use some goddamn, many big words, How come? I gotta like use the Google in the dictionary every like 10 min like.19200:29:08.990 --> 00:29:14.958The Alliance: And she wasn't talking like that. That was actually like my mother's Italian cheerleader, I think. But19300:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.550The Alliance: And she had a couple of comments like that, and19400:29:18.680 --> 00:29:39.599The Alliance: it was the greatest thing in the world, because I went back to the beginning of the book. I was like, I don't mind in my, you're gonna work, anyways, and there's vocabulary in the book from a bunch of fields you've probably never heard of, so I'm good. There's like the book has terms I got to use, no matter what. So I went back to the 1st 25 pages I was just like, let's just assume19500:29:39.600 --> 00:30:04.690The Alliance: I don't want my readers to hate me right off the bat, and, like excessive work should be earned, not just. And I look, I reread the 1st 5 pages, and I was like, Oh, wow! There's like 11 words in there, all of which are going to lose an unsophisticated reader. And worse, they're not going to get what I'm trying to say. They're gonna miss the theme. Because, my pretty. You know, my storytelling got in the way of my communication.19600:30:05.010 --> 00:30:17.379The Alliance: And so, like, my mom was basically like communication, Buddy, it's gotta come first, st like before I can't follow the story if I don't know what the story is, and it's such a simple sort of like duh.19700:30:17.670 --> 00:30:42.030The Alliance: but like, if you don't have it in like a less sophisticated reader who's gonna give you that? You're not gonna get it because you're just talking to smart. You know what I mean, like. So it to me. That's the like most invaluable stuff. It's why I always like talking to strangers and bars and on airplanes, and like I try to cross like, you know, I try to cross. If you if you could explain your idea to somebody at a bus stop.19800:30:42.350 --> 00:30:46.850The Alliance: you're doing really. You know what I mean like. Now you now you're really cooking kind of thing.19900:30:46.850 --> 00:30:52.529Whit: Yeah, the like. The big, definitely, the big space, I think, is resonating quite broadly in terms.20000:30:52.829 --> 00:30:55.819The Alliance: Getting more coffee, so I can really listen to you.20100:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.940Whit: Yeah, no worries.20200:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.595Whit: Okay. I was just gonna say, the20300:31:02.190 --> 00:31:08.449Whit: The general space, I think, is really easy to get to resonate, because it's a gnawing feeling that everybody is whether or not.20400:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.040The Alliance: Totally.20500:31:09.040 --> 00:31:37.059Whit: AI or not. They are concerned about what is gonna happen to the kids. What's happened, they feel behind. They feel left out. They don't know how to make the transition themselves the like. You know. How deeply do you go into? Where does flow science come in? How do you get to a flow state like I tell personal stories there of, like, how I've actually made some changes to try to unlock, that I've talked. We talked to my kids about it so that they start to understand what's you know the general space and.20600:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.969The Alliance: 2 quick. 2 things. One. Have you had this conversation with Courtney? Are you guys in touch talking.20700:31:42.250 --> 00:32:03.629Whit: So we are gonna have a conversation like, I. I'm leaning deeply into the network here of trying like I reached out to Rob, who wasn't at the original thing. I've got calls with Rick's Session House and up in Canada, the Edward Jones guy on Friday. I haven't connected with Rick, the other Rick Watkins. He didn't. He hasn't.20800:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.760The Alliance: Pizza.20900:32:05.570 --> 00:32:11.299The Alliance: I love Rick. He was the 1st guy to jump in. He came in through abundance 360, and I think21000:32:11.980 --> 00:32:25.349The Alliance: he's he was. He loved, I I we had a great call like he got a lot out of the onboarding, and he's really a fire. His company very big company is being sold right now, and I think it's swallowed his fucking life.21100:32:26.006 --> 00:32:27.320Whit: The software.21200:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.919The Alliance: Yeah, I I yeah, I think anything. He's selling it. And I just like, I think it's a i think it's just like21300:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.560The Alliance: I think he's. I think he's bummed, and I don't wanna like.21400:32:36.720 --> 00:32:51.960Whit: Yeah, when I sold my company, I was so nice. I was like, oh, 2 weeks before it's the deal closes. Everything should be done at that point like took a went to Vancouver Island with my wife, and I had to like climb a hillside to get a cell signal from the Us. To take a diligence call because the deal was falling.21500:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.470The Alliance: With.21600:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.300Whit: That's fucking.21700:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.610The Alliance: My my company.21800:32:54.850 --> 00:32:55.090Whit: My.21900:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.570The Alliance: Company. The flow research collected the training side of that. It's still not as put to bed22000:33:02.030 --> 00:33:08.920The Alliance: till July. And, by the way, I love like we're just trading. We're still training people. But like22100:33:11.630 --> 00:33:19.060The Alliance: all the little like the refund request from 3 years ago that got buried and nobody found until now.22200:33:19.060 --> 00:33:25.006The Alliance: Yeah, it's on your books, and you know, you're just like, yeah, alright.22300:33:25.560 --> 00:33:25.960Whit: So, yeah.22400:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.990The Alliance: That's what I say. So good on, good! Good on you and all that. Let me get to the22500:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.410The Alliance: okay.22600:33:29.410 --> 00:33:35.240The Alliance: Get to the second point which is buried under this. But it was the more important point. Because I really want you to think about this.22700:33:36.680 --> 00:33:42.090The Alliance: This. You are the 3rd or 4th phone call I've had in22800:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.159The Alliance: 10 days, maybe 8 days with somebody who wants to fill this exact gap.22900:33:48.690 --> 00:33:53.550The Alliance: Several of our alliance members. Those are just friends of mine calling me up to talk about a thing.23000:33:53.800 --> 00:34:18.700The Alliance: I think I am in a particular position where I'm filtering for it. So I don't think this is a mass thing right. But I am saying I'm seeing a lot of people say, oh, this matters to me. I want to be at the front end of it. So all I'm saying is, you wanna really specialize? So like in listening to you. One of the 1st things that I was thinking is.23100:34:19.020 --> 00:34:35.239The Alliance: you're doing something interesting. If you're talking at the softball team you're talking, you're talking to parents like you're already sort of doing that. And I was like, well, what happens if you get a room full of like 25 parents together and have that conversation. I'm not saying23200:34:35.949 --> 00:34:39.379The Alliance: this is where you want to end up, but I'm seeing a niche already.23300:34:40.170 --> 00:34:47.670The Alliance: and I would like I would. I would put a like. Okay, 3 months from now or 2 months from now. I'm gonna know enough to like, have a23400:34:48.420 --> 00:34:58.539The Alliance: father. AI, father, son AI conference right like for what you know. 2 h with with with win company. Kind of thing. I would tell you to like23500:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.910The Alliance: that, maybe not right now, but like23600:35:02.090 --> 00:35:26.859The Alliance: put sort of like. Look at the places that you find yourself specializing, and try to specialize a little bit more, and just create little events for yourself. Little things that you have to do. Maybe this isn't what you're gonna be, you know. You like the idea of workshops a little bit. You said it, you know you like the idea of a little more public speaking. And what you're really trying to figure out is like, I mean, look, dude if you be if you have the most compelling hour23700:35:26.860 --> 00:35:43.789The Alliance: of public. You know what I mean. Like you, you know you we could we you could we could! You could bypass all over the Youtube Channel. You know it's a marketing budget. If you you know what I mean like, there's lots of ways here. Once you get to mastery and specialty but like.23800:35:44.050 --> 00:35:50.416The Alliance: go keep going fast, go fast and hard, because there's a lot of people at the front end of this and23900:35:52.290 --> 00:36:15.189The Alliance: you know it like, there, it's a big space. There's gonna be lots of winners. I think, for sure. I think this is like, I think I think the joke is that prompt engineer is not a real job. There was never a real job. That was a lie. Come on, guys, right. Not a real job that was like a thing. For like 2 weeks before you figured out how to talk, to chat, gpt like a normal human, you fucking idiots. But, on the other hand, like24000:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.290The Alliance: AI,24100:36:17.340 --> 00:36:36.499The Alliance: psychologist, AI, marital count like all that, like the stuff where we are, where the the human AI friction is gonna be, that's the that's where we're actually gonna have. Have you gonna have to have humans for a while. You want an AI watching your relationship with AI to make sure you're not outsourcing your brain like, are you gonna trust24200:36:36.500 --> 00:36:52.109The Alliance: like? You know what I mean? It's sort of like I don't trust Chat Gbt. When it tells me writing is done, because I know, if I take a piece that my chat tells me is totally polished and wonderful, and I take it to my editor, and we read it aloud. He will come on hand like the end of paragraph one.24300:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.730Whit: Right.24400:36:52.730 --> 00:36:59.479The Alliance: Like in terms of the amount of errors in it. So like, that's a human. You're gonna need a human in that chain for a while.24500:37:00.450 --> 00:37:17.370The Alliance: and that like Fekanda opportunities. So what I I want, I think you want to just start trying to specialize a little bit more based on your own nature and curiosity. Just take it a little bit farther than you would to like, you know. Force yourself to get stay on the cutting, stay on the front edge of it.24600:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.070Whit: I like that. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.24700:37:21.710 --> 00:37:31.790The Alliance: Like, you don't think there's gonna be a parental organization for AI emerging in the next year. You know what I mean like, of course there is. If we had May24800:37:32.410 --> 00:37:39.289The Alliance: and and all that other shit, you know, we're gonna have like mothers against AI. It'll be may mothers against AI.24900:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.420Whit: Yeah,25000:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.029Whit: yeah, no. It's25100:37:50.670 --> 00:37:56.110Whit: I like that. I've definitely been, yeah. The the 2 places I've been drawn.25200:37:57.680 --> 00:38:10.119Whit: One is the the kids, and at the different age levels, right? Like, I've got a 14 year old. I've got 11 year old, but we've also got. You've also got the younger kids coming up. But I like my kids are really in the sweet spot for a lot of this going into middle school, going into high school25300:38:13.100 --> 00:38:19.239Whit: generation, not millennials like slightly older in the workforce that's trying to figure out how to25400:38:19.500 --> 00:38:26.619Whit: actually use this stuff in their job is the other place that I'm having a lot of conversations at work with.25500:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.200The Alliance: Yeah. The.25600:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.209Whit: That's a that's a busy like. That's a like I don't wanna like.25700:38:31.210 --> 00:38:41.560The Alliance: Let me. I'm gonna I'll give you something else. Because I'm not gonna I will. I may do it. But if this is my new book with Peter. I've been talking a lot about it. Nobody talks about it. But25800:38:42.030 --> 00:38:48.820The Alliance: if you're going to talk about human AI collaboration, you have to talk about interface design built for flow.25900:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.055Whit: Yeah.26000:38:49.290 --> 00:39:18.540The Alliance: That's thought right like, if you're right. And it's really that it that's huge, because the downside of AI is you could overload cognitive load in 2 seconds, and literally take the take yourself out for a day. Right? So like interface design to keep you in flow. And, by the way to keep you. So if you have interface design that keep where part of it is the challenge skills balance where the AI is designed to push you up the challenge skills balance legitimately.26100:39:18.540 --> 00:39:33.120The Alliance: you have an AI that will not rot your brain because it's literally by trying to keep you in the challenge skills switch. But it has to be. Actually, you can't fake that. But that's earned up mean that you were talking about earlier. So I think there's a26200:39:33.570 --> 00:39:40.380The Alliance: I think there's an interesting question there of interface design. And I also think.26300:39:41.470 --> 00:39:50.000The Alliance: then this is where I was. Gonna tell you to start hunting is you've got these. This is great. You've got these 2 categories work and and parents basically. And26400:39:50.320 --> 00:40:10.029The Alliance: where do they intersect like right? And one place they intersect is interface design. I'm not saying that's where you want to spend your life. But I am saying the same interface challenges that you're trying to solve in a work environment. Parents are gonna stall with one need to solve for their kids for the exact same reason. So it is an intersect.26500:40:10.030 --> 00:40:29.879Whit: I mean, I actually wrote down today, like, Do I do, I try and build an interface for how? My kid, how I want my kids to interact with AI, since I know they're using Chat Gpt and Gemini and trying to do that in a way that's promoting the the characteristics that needs flow. It's also, like, you know, some of the grit side and the the like throttling of information right? Like the lot.26600:40:29.880 --> 00:40:37.729The Alliance: No, it was. It was interesting. I was playing with Grok, and I was trying to get like information out of China, and told me. I could have the information if I paid the tax. It was really odd.26700:40:38.484 --> 00:40:44.300Whit: But yeah, that was the one of the things I wrote on my whiteboard was that26800:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.230Whit: you know, as as26900:40:46.440 --> 00:40:53.980Whit: intelligence becomes less of a nodal and more of a network property going forward right like. So the the intelligence of a system.27000:40:54.060 --> 00:41:16.940Whit: historically, we've increased it by adding more nodes, more smart people, more resources as that becomes more of a network of how the information flows between the nodes, because the nodes themselves have almost infinite intelligence, at some to some degree, that it's the designing. The interaction patterns becomes the differentiator, not the the nodes.27100:41:16.940 --> 00:41:44.560The Alliance: It's also, I mean, there's a couple of things no, people are not looking at. And I poked fun of this in my novel last time on cyberspace. I had 2 autonomous cars get into a fight over park space in the novel, right? And everybody thought it was funny and all that if no, no, that's real, that shit happens today like it's that's like we're here. It's a year later, and the AI one that is fascinating me is. And this was a Gibson thing. He sort of poked at it.27200:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.290The Alliance: As we get more and more individualized. Ais27300:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.829The Alliance: like our ais are gonna be in conflict with other AI.27400:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.390Whit: Yeah.27500:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.569The Alliance: And right. So you've got like.27600:41:57.060 --> 00:42:05.759The Alliance: and you and you got millions of ais out there right like, it's like the Traveling Salesman problem for intelligence. It's really bizarre.27700:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.540Whit: Well, you know I'm reading.27800:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.200The Alliance: Keep saying, Oh, AI will solve this, and I'm like, are you? You're you think.27900:42:12.310 --> 00:42:31.380The Alliance: like I? I'm not entirely like it's 1 thing to like an AI can solve. Oh, how should Palestine negotiate with, you know, blood? Okay, that's at least like semi structured problem, whatever. But like, how do a billionais negotiate with a billion ais for a non moving target of a goal.28000:42:32.190 --> 00:42:38.990Whit: Right. Well, I mean I was the book I'm reading right now is going back to the Never split the difference which I'd started before Chris Voss's book.28100:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.000The Alliance: Grace's book.28200:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.368Whit: Yeah, and and the28300:42:42.280 --> 00:42:55.819Whit: the thinking, or like the thread I was going down is like, what does negotiation look like between agents? Given the singularity article that agents were coming up with their own language. And once you start to get agents negotiating with agents like, what's the negotiating paradigm28400:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.290Whit: when it's agents, not humans doing it. And they're trying to come to28500:43:00.570 --> 00:43:13.899Whit: the outcome that falls within their guard, you know, ideally within the guardrails. But how do they manipulate each other right, like boss's book, is all about the emotional intelligence and kind of like the F. You know, the late night Dj voice and these other things, and mirroring28600:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.950Whit: what's the equivalent in the agent space as you start to have more of society transacted.28700:43:19.950 --> 00:43:34.849The Alliance: So this is, that's a that's a nightmare. Interestingly, quite interesting question. Alright, these are, yeah. I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of all the ideas because I love them and they're delicious. But I want to stay one level higher and where I can. Actually, I'll I mean, I'll fucking. Just talk cool ideas about.28800:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.839Whit: That's happening.28900:43:35.840 --> 00:43:43.879The Alliance: Hour, if you want, and you know what we got. 15 min left, what? What rapid fire through a couple of other things that we might be able to put some frameworks around.29000:43:44.890 --> 00:43:52.479Whit: So I mean, you've you've gotten to know me a little bit right, like you saw me interact with the group. We've had a few conversations. You've heard a little bit of my space like29100:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.429Whit: what do you know? And I, you know I think my natural tendency.29200:43:56.590 --> 00:44:15.159Whit: I actually, I like hearing that you go slow and on these some of this stuff, because I think I am like I'm a prag like I'm a pragmatic in agitator like, I like to push and poke, but I'm not a fly like I'm not a jump off the cliff and hope the shoot shoot opens kind of innovator, and so like trying to like. I'm trying to Prac, you know. Go like.29300:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.050The Alliance: Yeah, I.29400:44:16.050 --> 00:44:16.420Whit: Yes.29500:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.310The Alliance: So I have a belief they don't.29600:44:25.270 --> 00:44:31.060The Alliance: I know where my destination is, and I know what I'm gonna do every day to get there, and I don't.29700:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.860The Alliance: Where, when?29800:44:33.470 --> 00:44:40.470The Alliance: Don't I literally don't, and don't ever think about when? Because when is artificial?29900:44:41.010 --> 00:44:51.810The Alliance: And you know, my friend, my friend, we were a friend of mine was. The acosta says this said this the other day. She's like, you know. Thank God.30000:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.369The Alliance: I didn't get all the things I wanted.30100:44:55.530 --> 00:45:11.649The Alliance: It would have killed me had I gotten what I wanted. You know what I mean. Luckily I got just what I ended up getting like it was just perfect. What I wanted would have killed me. And oftentimes, when you're trying to rush something you end up like there, instead of what naturally30200:45:12.060 --> 00:45:12.840The Alliance: and30300:45:14.130 --> 00:45:22.100The Alliance: And like, I'm a big, I just keep working the problem when I wanted to start a nonprofit for new city school kids that taught them how to be sports writers.30400:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.899The Alliance: Knew I wanted to do with the basketball team as a partner. And I, just30500:45:27.290 --> 00:45:29.139The Alliance: I just made a phone call a day30600:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.569The Alliance: till 7 years. And I made the right phone call30700:45:34.060 --> 00:45:54.379The Alliance: literally and like, suddenly, I was in business with the Lakers and Dave Eggers after school tutoring organization. And like, I mean, it was like instant like this whole thing, this just it fell together overnight. I didn't have to do anything. They had facilities, everybody, everybody had everything, and if I would have tried to push it it would have never happened. And it happened like30800:45:54.520 --> 00:46:13.600The Alliance: the fucking Lakers. You can't like you. I just it was like in terms of like, if you want a story, if you want something sexy, if you want to like, and I all it. Literally, I didn't put a timer. And I just said, I'm gonna work the problem every day until it until the right thing is there. That's how I think about it. Same thing with books. I'm just gonna30900:46:14.320 --> 00:46:22.060The Alliance: write my 500 words every day, and it's gonna be done when it's done. I, you know, when I sell a book, so31000:46:22.850 --> 00:46:40.350The Alliance: I won't sell a book until I've sort of written like at least the 1st 50 or 60 pages. Right. You only need the 1st 20 to sell a book in a proposal, but I won't actually go. I won't do it because I know that, like if you're once you get to about 25,000 words. If you still have momentum.31100:46:40.560 --> 00:46:50.039The Alliance: you, you've got a you've got a book like it's fine like you can finish almost anything from that point. But if you don't have the momentum at 25,000 words or so, I want to be like31200:46:50.710 --> 00:47:00.239The Alliance: insight of that target before I agree to take anybody's money, because that's the deal I don't like. I, you know. Time is when I'm super caution.31300:47:00.450 --> 00:47:07.760The Alliance: like when we talk about a bold protecting the downside, and Richard Branson protecting the downside. I don't know if you read Bold, or you know the story.31400:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.719The Alliance: so when he decides he's gonna invent. He's gonna have an create, an airline.31500:47:13.960 --> 00:47:24.080The Alliance: Everybody is like, are you out of your fucking mind? Nobody. You can't innovate in airlines like. It's terrible idea. Their money pits. They're everything. They're awful. He bet half his record business31600:47:24.470 --> 00:47:35.639The Alliance: on the airline. But he cut a really crazy deal, which was. If a year in the company wasn't viable, he could return the planes for full money back.31700:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.154Whit: Hmm.31800:47:36.910 --> 00:48:00.890The Alliance: So that was his real cost. Was the interest. Was the planes right? He needed 2 planes to start his airline and then some other stuff, but he basically got the deal. And then he lost his airline because he protected. If it didn't work, he had an out. That's how I think about everything. I don't fuck around with it because I don't know what your home life is like, but if I fuck with the bottom line and my wife gets nervous.31900:48:01.220 --> 00:48:10.989The Alliance: They don't have a life right like like I. Everything goes away right, like everything is very unpleasant from that moment on, and I start getting questions I can't answer.32000:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.870Whit: Yeah.32100:48:11.870 --> 00:48:30.149The Alliance: Like, why are you writing a novel when we're not in bills? And she's right like I don't have an answer like you're right. They don't make a lot of money. I should not do that, and since I'm addicted to writing the novels, I can't put myself in that position, I know. So I don't like, I know, in terms of like that's again I filtered by like.32200:48:30.340 --> 00:48:41.830The Alliance: always filter by like what I can take, what I want, what I desire and what's like the most stable thing for the people I love going forward like. I don't fuck with it. If I you know there are times when I'll32300:48:42.150 --> 00:48:45.559The Alliance: it's my wife to take a big bet. But I'm like.32400:48:45.930 --> 00:48:54.959The Alliance: then it's a conversation, and we put caps on it like, Okay, it's a hundred $1,000 bet, but like that's you know, if it's not blah blah, that sort of stuff.32500:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.480Whit: Okay, that makes sense.32600:48:58.900 --> 00:49:13.110Whit: you know this group collective group better than I do. And you started to mention Courtney like, who should I be talking? Who should I be digging in even more with? Amongst the other alliance members like I? Part of what attracted me to this. Was the other people like the fact that.32700:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.979The Alliance: So I think I so I think32800:49:18.130 --> 00:49:32.273The Alliance: Courtney, because she's circling similar territory. But, like you guys like you might cooperate on curriculum and totally deviate on who's getting that curriculum? And whereas it's going kind of thing.32900:49:32.910 --> 00:49:36.339The Alliance: I think. It strikes me that33000:49:36.970 --> 00:49:41.089The Alliance: Jason Tedros, who you've right, Jason.33100:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.090Whit: Second call with him.33200:49:42.090 --> 00:49:48.788The Alliance: Yeah, he's a good. He's just a good AI, mind, he's got a good sense of sort of what's going on with it.33300:49:50.090 --> 00:49:50.745The Alliance: it's33400:49:52.560 --> 00:50:05.200The Alliance: Interestingly, oddly, Rick Sessenhaus, who you haven't met. His whole project is trying to take. He's like one of the world's leading golf instructors right? And he's trying to AI himself. And33500:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.100The Alliance: I'm not saying33600:50:07.680 --> 00:50:18.689The Alliance: you want to do that. But I'm saying that's a side of this world that you really aren't looking at at all. And it's probably gonna play a huge. You know what I mean, like you just worth the conversation. Just so you can.33700:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.009The Alliance: Is this a thing.33800:50:21.010 --> 00:50:21.569Whit: Yeah, the part.33900:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.150Whit: You know what I mean.34000:50:22.150 --> 00:50:44.719Whit: Like, I I facilitate a lot of workshops at at work. And it's like, well, could you? How much of that workshop facilitation could you, AI, like I'm not quite like. Certainly I haven't done much with it, but that's because I lost some of my team and some layoffs. Recently, I'm like, well, how much could I get? How much could I create AI facility, facilitation for human centered design workshops around.34100:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.370The Alliance: Also tell you so I don't know.34200:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.360The Alliance: Oh, yeah, it's in June.34300:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.559The Alliance: So I've got a buddy. Mike Koenig.34400:50:54.181 --> 00:50:57.800The Alliance: Who's actually doing a 1 day seminar in June that34500:50:58.170 --> 00:51:02.100The Alliance: I don't know if there's seats available or he's gonna do it again. But he's the like.34600:51:03.170 --> 00:51:15.399The Alliance: He's sort of a like he's an Uber marketer is what he is I like, and like good friends with Tony Robbins, good friend with Joe Polish, good friend with whatever. But he's the guy out of everybody I know who said.34700:51:16.650 --> 00:51:32.030The Alliance: Let me use. Let me figure out every single fucking AI tool there is that I can use to like, make me money and do me and everything like all of it. So he does these like sort of one day. Seminars of like, it's just like a tool blast. Basically.34800:51:32.380 --> 00:51:53.739The Alliance: he's a guy. He's he's business model. One level higher up is if you go to him and pay him a hundred $50,000. Him and his team will, if we'll take everything you are usually this only works if you have a big mailing list but they'll reinvent a new company based on your data, your who you are, where you want to go, and they'll build every single thing you need34900:51:54.050 --> 00:51:57.230The Alliance: for you over the course of like 5 days.35000:51:57.350 --> 00:52:13.679The Alliance: like everything you walk out with, like, you will basically walk away with a company and often with customers. You have to start with a bunch of stuff, and I don't think he's got it as dialed quite as dialed as he wants the world to like. I don't think it's that smooth. I didn't pay money for it. You know what I mean. Like.35100:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.180Whit: Yeah, yeah.35200:52:14.180 --> 00:52:20.960The Alliance: Like I'd rather do this on my own, but like that's cool, and I see why I see the market. But my only point is that like35300:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.216The Alliance: he's also he's a he's a good dude and35400:52:27.060 --> 00:52:33.980The Alliance: I might attend one of his seminars, or something. Is that just to get the like the tool blast, just so you could sort of get35500:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.939The Alliance: or can. I'll I'll35600:52:41.140 --> 00:52:46.990The Alliance: hold on one second while we're on the call. Let me text him and see if he's done this seminar thing yet.35700:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.829Whit: Ing is one of those last names like I could think.35800:52:52.830 --> 00:53:00.410The Alliance: Oh, it's KOEN, IGS Mike KOEN Koenigse.35900:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.590Whit: Okay, got it cool.36000:53:09.230 --> 00:53:26.561The Alliance: I'm just texting him, maybe when his when his thing is, I just know that's coming up. There's probably other people doing it, but I would like. That's an area where I'm like, Oh, tool! You want! You want a tool, Guru, and in in your mix who else in the alliance comes to mind.36100:53:28.590 --> 00:53:34.209The Alliance: I might have a conversation with Anatoly as well.36200:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.300The Alliance: Only he's not.36300:53:37.660 --> 00:53:45.452The Alliance: So he's sort of doing tech upgrades for companies plus peak performance right? And36400:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.180The Alliance: I36500:53:53.540 --> 00:54:15.549The Alliance: he's gonna have a really cool window into the thing that you're not looking at, because your brain isn't that which is the deep tech approach to upgrading companies like live into the tech stack. How to use this stuff like he he! He should have that view at a leap deeper level, and if he doesn't, he needs it to do what he wants to do right, but like.36600:54:15.890 --> 00:54:16.580Whit: Yup!36700:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.430The Alliance: Hold on one sec.36800:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.940The Alliance: All right. It is in the chat.36900:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.417Whit: Okay. Great. Thanks.37000:54:32.350 --> 00:54:35.419The Alliance: The AI accelerator, workshop.37100:54:35.420 --> 00:54:35.860Whit: Awesome.37200:54:36.156 --> 00:54:39.120The Alliance: Oh, he's got a photo of him and Peter Diamandis37300:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.143The Alliance: standing next to them when they took this photo. I think I was. That was just at Peter's event.37400:54:45.940 --> 00:54:59.449Whit: So you talked about how your network has given you confidence to take on all whenever you're taking on something new, and that's been a big part of it, like, you know the line. I'm I'm all in on the Alliance. The process to like getting to know people.37500:54:59.450 --> 00:55:06.819The Alliance: Well, let me. Yeah, let me give you. Let me let me give you a a high level piece of information that will make a lot of this make sense to you.37600:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.145The Alliance: So, my friend Philip Rosedale, who37700:55:10.800 --> 00:55:26.759The Alliance: he's my Philip has by vote for like one of, if not he given created SIM City. But he's like he's a neuroscientist. He created SIM City. He's in my opinion. He's the smartest guy in the room. By the way he's ridiculously. Has someone a good boxer? Fuck him just fuck that guy right37800:55:28.030 --> 00:55:51.520The Alliance: literally, and he dresses sort of like an urban cowboy. You're just literally like I'm like he walks in the river like shoot him down, fuck this guy. But anyways he did a really interesting study that really influenced my thinking once, and he never really published it, but he just did it, and he was trying to figure out what was really at the hub of innovation hubs. Why was San Francisco's Silicon Valley blooming37900:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.640The Alliance: pockets in Seattle pockets in New York?38000:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.000Whit: Good.38100:55:55.000 --> 00:56:13.549The Alliance: And other places were trying and failing like. What? What was it like? What? What was the secret sauce? He did a bunch of analysis. Because he had SIM City he could model. He could like whatever he came up with. He could model and test right. So it was this great feedback loop. But he figured out there was one fucking thing that drove innovation.38200:56:13.810 --> 00:56:24.680The Alliance: and it was literally, if there was a lot of people who are starting a lot of shit in the same area. If you got bounced out of a job. There was another job waiting for you.38300:56:25.190 --> 00:56:30.779The Alliance: That was it. That was it. It was a financial fallback position. Net38400:56:30.990 --> 00:56:36.069The Alliance: that was the was was what made the difference, and38500:56:39.590 --> 00:56:53.570The Alliance: one of the original ideas about the alliance, and it's still sort of an idea in my head is, and I don't think I'm gonna do it because I don't. I can't figure out how to do it and get everybody what they want. But if I could build the alliance to about 100 people.38600:56:53.570 --> 00:56:53.930Whit: Yeah.38700:56:53.930 --> 00:57:05.519The Alliance: So we could have that safety net right? That was one of the original ideas is, build it to about a hundred people, because it's it's that safety net. It's exactly what you'd want, right? Like a hundred people who are all starting really cool stuff38800:57:05.640 --> 00:57:20.609The Alliance: with different access to capital people. People can pop around in that network while they right like that, was one of the original ideas. I still think on this smaller scale, we can get something, and I think it seems pretty clear to me.38900:57:20.720 --> 00:57:31.669The Alliance: though I don't, that this is going to grow into something that's gonna be a monthly ongoing or a year long program, or like, it's very clear to me that nobody's got a project. They're going to be done within 4 months39000:57:31.990 --> 00:57:39.720The Alliance: at all, like not in the slightest. And it's very clear to me that, like, it's just a question of how much do people want39100:57:39.900 --> 00:58:05.640The Alliance: each month? How much can they handle? How much do they want? And can I price it in such a way that, like it makes sense for me, as you know, and everybody right? Can it work, but like it doesn't like. That's what it strikes me that like this isn't sort of going away, and that may may end up being there. But like, that's how I think about it. I just think about like to me one of the reasons I started the license. I think safety and security is just39200:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.559The Alliance: sort of39300:58:06.720 --> 00:58:14.900The Alliance: bigger, bigger rolodexes, also the fact. And this is the truth of the matter. This is the other side of that coin that really influences my thinking.39400:58:16.450 --> 00:58:33.610The Alliance: I'm a pretty popular guy with a pretty robust network to just like we're gonna just be like high school about it. And there have been a number of times in my career. My fucking ass is on the line where, like it's been really, truly scary, and my ass is on the line. And I've reached out to all of my network for help.39500:58:33.790 --> 00:58:37.570The Alliance: Okay, everybody says, yes.39600:58:38.260 --> 00:58:42.969The Alliance: Who actually delivers is general, like 2 or 3 people, maybe.39700:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.470The Alliance: and maybe one person actually gives me what I was hoping to get39800:58:46.580 --> 00:58:58.509The Alliance: right and what they each promise me. And 2 other people are sort of there like that's really the reality of it. And any law who you're gonna meet later later on the next. Digital pop up.39900:58:59.050 --> 00:59:19.129The Alliance: who's a relationship expert, seems very generous about it. She says you you could think about it as like everybody's disappointing you, or you could think about it, that everybody is doing their absolute fucking best at the time for you, based on where they're at and what the resources are, which is probably closer to the truth also. But I've been on both sides of that. I've been the guy not giving enough.40000:59:19.760 --> 00:59:42.369The Alliance: or like knowing that, like how desperate the person is, and I'd like not having anything like not I can't like this is as much I can give, because I can't fix right. I've been on all sides of that, so I've come to believe that like you need a pretty thick network like you need a lot of right it. It needs to be actually pretty wide. And and people sort of need to be a little focused on trying to help each other40100:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.545The Alliance: otherwise.40200:59:44.840 --> 01:00:03.659The Alliance: you know you that. So that's sort of the thinking behind the Lion, the Alliance. Everybody's sort of we. We all seem to be on the same page with it. You know what I mean like. I'm not the only everybody's making phone calls. Everybody's like, I've never seen a group. People are more fired up to be friends fast than you guys unbelievable like40301:00:05.120 --> 01:00:18.619The Alliance: it. It's great. I mean, I think that's what happens when? Because I think everybody feels safe because we Chase and I spent so much time picking people. You know what I mean, like the some of a lot of the front end, some of the front end filtering got done. So you know what I mean. Like.40401:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.230Whit: Yeah.40501:00:21.090 --> 01:00:25.589The Alliance: So I like it's and the other, the other thing is40601:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.289The Alliance: as you pursue40701:00:31.570 --> 01:00:51.645The Alliance: these goals a little bit further. Parents like blah blah! You're like. That's your network will start to expand in pursuit of the goals. So I think some of what you want is gonna like you'll get it with the alliance, not probably at the level that you know we we all want. Maybe that comes over time. If I figure this thing out.40801:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.550The Alliance: But I think you'll also get more of it.40901:00:54.660 --> 01:01:14.349The Alliance: I also like, I'm watching you. You've decided to say, stop being an introvert. You're like, I'm gonna go play extrovert on TV, because that's what what needs to happen. And you're doing a really good job with it. The only thing I would tell you on that one is, keep playing extrovert on TV. But make know that it takes like you need longer recovery.41001:01:14.670 --> 01:01:18.380Whit: I've taken so many naps since the Alliance started.41101:01:18.380 --> 01:01:30.939The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, that's what I was doing. Like, I can do it. I could like, that's what the alliance like. That's the funny thing about the alliance is like, I gotta do more people. So I gotta like have more like a meditation at the end of the day is no longer optional for me.41201:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.020The Alliance: you know, like things like that.41301:01:33.020 --> 01:01:50.780Whit: I have a swinging chair on my back porch. That's my happy place for like 1015 min of recovery. It's like I I that was the other thing. I've noticeably more tired in the middle of the day, after starting with the flow period and trying to be extra like it's I'm like, am I? Sleep deprived? I don't think so. I think it's just.41401:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.370The Alliance: No, you're using more muted.41501:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.200Whit: You're using market.41601:01:53.200 --> 01:02:07.180The Alliance: Now the good news is you'll get a little more used to it over time, right like you like anything else that it'll it'll stabilize, and then you'll move faster, too. So that'll it'll speed will increase with time. But yeah, no, you you will be like.41701:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.670The Alliance: It's almost funny, because the more you sort of41801:02:13.050 --> 01:02:24.059The Alliance: do the things that produce peak performance, the more you find yourself only doing the things that produce peak performance, because the other stuff falls away because it's actually not tenable like.41901:02:24.590 --> 01:02:33.439The Alliance: That's what I've always said, like people from. It's just like 7 or 8 things you do every day, but like that, it's sort of like it. Just42001:02:33.620 --> 01:02:37.269The Alliance: when once you put flow, generated flow at the center of what you do.42101:02:37.560 --> 01:02:51.600The Alliance: It's pretty self. It just unfolds from there. And you're like, Oh, okay, like, I just steer by this stuff. And it becomes a thing you can steer by this just very effective, because it always leads towards wellbeing and meaning and purpose and happiness, and you know.42201:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.900Whit: Count.42301:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.130Whit: Thanks, Stephen. I know we're at time. I don't wanna keep you past.42401:02:58.130 --> 01:03:07.590The Alliance: Yeah, the one. The one thing I wanna the one thing you should you you should keep in mind, of course, is that cause. This is as a protected downside guy. Know this42501:03:08.010 --> 01:03:17.290The Alliance: more flow, which is, gonna keep happening to you over time. Clearly, those highs calm with.42601:03:18.410 --> 01:03:21.830The Alliance: you know, long term planning and risk aversion turned off42701:03:22.010 --> 01:03:31.240The Alliance: so no financial decisions and flow, no bet the company decisions and flow, no super hyped up42801:03:31.420 --> 01:03:49.450The Alliance: inflow conversations with your wife about the business, you know. Like, don't do that to yourself. You're married, like all of it. You don't want like that stuff is great. You want to use that to do all the brainstorming in the world, but like you want to look at it and start committing time and money42901:03:49.550 --> 01:03:54.520The Alliance: only in the sober light of day, when it also lines up right cause otherwise.43001:03:55.740 --> 01:04:05.219The Alliance: especially the way you're wired right? You just won't like the result. It'll be really uncomfortable, and you and and you'll end up stopping, and that, you know, that's demotivating.43101:04:05.520 --> 01:04:22.189Whit: Great. Well, I'm also just I don't know. I guess I'm always open to those like Michael Michael type recommendations like, I'm I'm a sponge. I like to learn new things. I like to hear interesting perspectives. So if there's other stuff you're getting to know me, things that you think I should be checking out that maybe I haven't run into.43201:04:22.190 --> 01:04:32.080The Alliance: Yeah, I will. I'll totally keep it in mind. The other thing, Buck, is it called?43301:04:33.250 --> 01:04:38.550The Alliance: You know, Peter Diamandis has a an email, an AI email list, you know about this.43401:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.760Whit: I don't know that I know.43501:04:41.040 --> 01:05:01.060The Alliance: It's so he got tired of negative news. So he has an so you sign up for his service, and he's got an AI search service that will go out and scour the globe for credited sources of optimistic information and categories. You like to counteract people's scarcity mindedness, and he's got his stuff is really good on AI.43601:05:01.650 --> 01:05:02.130Whit: Okay.43701:05:02.130 --> 01:05:02.670The Alliance: So43801:05:03.500 --> 01:05:18.859The Alliance: and it, that's just an easy one. His newsletter is not bad on a it's not. He tends to repeat himself, and he's always selling abundance. 360 and whatever but he's he's he's got his finger on the fucking, cutting edge of more AI stuff.43901:05:19.207 --> 01:05:28.079The Alliance: I mean, I think he's out of his fucking. Mind. I tell him so every morning. I'm like we're in the middle of an AI hype cycle. You're wrong. You just don't see it. He hates me for it.44001:05:29.750 --> 01:05:30.234The Alliance: But44101:05:30.850 --> 01:05:34.250The Alliance: And I could be wrong. Maybe he's right and I'm wrong. I don't know.44201:05:34.490 --> 01:05:35.170Whit: Yeah.44301:05:36.820 --> 01:05:59.598The Alliance: But anyways, cool, this is great. I'm gonna I'm gonna sort of walk through Ryan through the ideas of what we're trying to kind of hold you accountable towards. And I and I really, I think in your case it's literally just. Are you planning every day and sort of advancing yourself towards like passion and purpose. Are you starting to,44401:06:01.920 --> 01:06:21.230The Alliance: Are you continuously like walking up the challenge skills balance like in like, you know, it's not enough. You can't whiteboard every day for the next 3 months. You gotta give yourself, like many targets, to step up and step up and step up. Think is is really important, and I think filtering for who you are.44501:06:21.975 --> 01:06:29.607The Alliance: As a filter for what comes next is the like. Those are the 3 things that like, keep doing what you're doing. And it like, you know.44601:06:32.940 --> 01:06:49.890The Alliance: I I like everything you're doing. I think I think I think you're like, I think you're nailing it. I like you're doing this. I don't have much of advice for you, doing all all the right stuff. Other than you know, unless these kinds of reframings. I'm excited for you.44701:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.520The Alliance: That's a good.44801:06:51.520 --> 01:06:51.930Whit: Okay.44901:06:51.930 --> 01:06:54.690The Alliance: There's good is going to get multiplied.45001:06:54.690 --> 01:07:01.469Whit: Yeah, it's it's invigorating for sure I've had it. It's that's I do an emotional fitness group every month45101:07:01.560 --> 01:07:31.250Whit: with some of the guys on my softball like he runs a bunch of ads, and it's like a circle where you you practice physical fitness, practice, emotional fitness. Get in the habit of exercising that on a regular basis, and you kind of come with your word trying to give people more words to talk about the emotions, and you get a couple of minutes. Nobody responds during a couple of minutes, like everybody just says their piece go around and then you can get feedback or whatnot. But it's more about the active listening and kind of explaining where you're at. And my word, this last month was invigorated for sure, like just of.45201:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.160The Alliance: Oh, nice!45301:07:32.160 --> 01:07:42.280Whit: Coming off of. I was using my analogy about being in the boat, and kind of going down the river, and all that stuff going before, and kind of feeling conflicted and stuck. In this this month it was invigorated.45401:07:42.790 --> 01:07:59.090The Alliance: Oh, nice, good one final quick question for you. Cause I've heard a couple of slides, and I'm just trying to get get it says, so I can decide what to do with the next one. The digital pop up. Some people loved the free for all format45501:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.950The Alliance: some people were like, why wasn't it more focused? That wasn't particularly useful.45601:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.559The Alliance: Where do you come out.45701:08:06.276 --> 01:08:22.610Whit: I generally like ambiguity, and I'm okay with unstructured and pop up, you know, unless there's you know, I I think a couple of minutes of making sure that we understand, whatever the specialty is of the person that's on the call. So that sparks a relevant conversation, I think, is useful. I don't think it needs to be45801:08:22.970 --> 01:08:23.920Whit: okay.45901:08:23.920 --> 01:08:40.850The Alliance: Alright. I mean, all I'm literally doing is asking everybody to talk to. And I'm just taking a vote. So far you're on the side that's winning. But I did hear a couple people were like that was just 2, and I and I was wondering I was like, is that like, I don't necessarily know if the problem was us.46001:08:40.970 --> 01:09:08.350The Alliance: It might like, you know what I mean. But I have to check. I gotta talk to everybody and figure out like, because I I find that talking to Sarah in that sort of way is like it's the most useful, because she's gonna say, like 4 useful things that are then gonna connect together in my brain. And that's gonna be the like. The the real gem is how those things connected together. But that's just sort of me, and I want to make sure other people sort of dug that, too.46101:09:08.479 --> 01:09:19.459Whit: And I assume we're gonna get more on this San Francisco day soon. Ish from Ryan, the one in June where you're talking, and we may have tickets to the Conference. The AI tech week.46201:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.931The Alliance: Yeah, we do have tickets to the conference. It's human tech week we have tickets that day46301:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.160Whit: You have day. You have day passes for everybody in the alliance.46401:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.861The Alliance: Yeah, I well, we we're gonna find Ryan should find out there tomorrow.46501:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.190The Alliance: I don't know if their week passes or day passes, and I'm46601:09:38.620 --> 01:10:08.090The Alliance: it's not a cheap conference, and I'm ready, like, I already started getting everybody in and I can't like I don't want to overstep with Nicole. So I sort of like I'm letting her steer on that one. I think. I think we Ryan, I think we're gonna stay at. I want to say the Zephyr Hotel is my guess. But that should I think Ryan will send that out. Courtney has some suggestions. So we're just gonna work. Courtney's Courtney wants to be cruise director. She's I like, she's46701:10:08.120 --> 01:10:14.660The Alliance: picking all the whatever I don't like. I'm just like, no, no, you guys, you guys plan. I I like it better this way.46801:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.993Whit: Great. Yeah.46901:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.149The Alliance: Yeah, no, I thought, but it would be nice.47001:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.809The Alliance: I didn't know.47101:10:20.040 --> 01:10:26.409The Alliance: Oh, I didn't know Ryan had reached out. I thought he said he was gonna do that already. I think it's actually Monday. He probably will reach out this week.47201:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.400Whit: Okay. Cool.47301:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.500The Alliance: Other today. Yeah, it is God. It's Monday47401:10:32.030 --> 01:10:35.790The Alliance: work straight through the weekend. I don't even like I'm not quite sure.47501:10:35.790 --> 01:10:42.219Whit: I was. Honestly, I had to go to the airport at 6 Am. This morning, so I'm like on East Coast time now, back in Virginia for a couple of days, so.47601:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.120The Alliance: Oh, all right.47701:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.040Whit: Little disrupted start to the week, but.47801:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.748The Alliance: Those traveled weeks are difficult for me.47901:10:49.170 --> 01:10:49.760Whit: Yeah.48001:10:50.184 --> 01:10:53.155The Alliance: Alright! This was fun. This is cool.48101:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.910The Alliance: I'm excited.48201:10:56.180 --> 01:10:56.840The Alliance: I.48301:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.320Whit: Yeah.48401:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.539The Alliance: Yeah, I'm excited for you. I think this is exciting. This is just gonna be great. I wanna see where you are next month.48501:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.670Whit: Sounds great. I'm I'm enjoying it. Thanks, Stephen. I'm glad.48601:11:05.670 --> 01:11:06.210The Alliance: Thank you. Bye.48701:11:06.210 --> 01:11:06.520Whit: Okay.
