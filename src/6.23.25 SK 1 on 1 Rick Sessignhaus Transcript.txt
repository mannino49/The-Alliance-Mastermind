WEBVTT100:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.410Rick Sessinghaus: Hey! Steven.200:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.940The Alliance: How are you, Rick?300:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.810Rick Sessinghaus: I'm doing. Okay, how's the Monday treating you good.400:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.390The Alliance: Good, really good.500:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.200Rick Sessinghaus: Good, good, all right.600:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.453The Alliance: Us very quickly on the top.700:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.588The Alliance: I know life is life. But800:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.774The Alliance: there's 4 triggers you're focusing on some creative microdosing, and some900:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.429The Alliance: as an active recovery scale of one to 10. How are you doing on accountability for those things?1000:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.010Rick Sessinghaus: One to 10, a 2.1100:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.710The Alliance: That's a no, no.1200:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.379Rick Sessinghaus: No, the the meditation 5 times a week. And then the other areas are dismal.1300:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.240The Alliance: Okay?1400:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.870The Alliance: Why.1500:04:56.806 --> 00:05:05.689Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah. So I wrote down a few things here. I'm in struggle phase so I'm looking at reframing it because I'm in struggle phase. I think1600:05:07.510 --> 00:05:25.999Rick Sessinghaus: what I've noticed is that when I'm home, so right now I'm always on the on the road for 2 weeks when I'm home. Routines are are pretty tight. Get up! Do my workout, Sauna. When I'm on the road. Haven't been able to find routines that work1700:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.561Rick Sessinghaus: yet with the schedule. So it's kind of like goes 2 steps forward, one step back, and unfortunately those 2 2 weeks was more than1800:05:33.900 --> 00:05:55.549Rick Sessinghaus: Then one step back. So it's it's balancing that out when I'm on the road. I was at the Us. Open for the golf tournament. It was a very long week, long hours, and it's it's not like, oh, I know I'm going to be with my player from 8 to 4, and I can. Some days it would be longer. Some days we had rain delays, and again I hate hearing myself talk about1900:05:55.550 --> 00:06:07.610Rick Sessinghaus: excuses, but the reasons of that, and then, not being able to to fit in all the stuff that I want to do, because usually I go back to the hotel and I do coaching calls, and I do other things like that. So I over schedule myself, especially in a2000:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.689Rick Sessinghaus: kind of a volatile2100:06:10.110 --> 00:06:21.479Rick Sessinghaus: where I don't know what the schedule is. And then looking at. We we talked a lot about, you know, creating kind of 100 steps to some of my missions, and it was very.2200:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.469Rick Sessinghaus: very helpful. Now the missions have2300:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.590Rick Sessinghaus: shift it a little bit. And we can go into knew they would.2400:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.980Rick Sessinghaus: Moment. Yeah, but just that exercise is very helpful, as I mentioned to you last time. As I.2500:06:34.210 --> 00:06:47.839Rick Sessinghaus: I get very excited about ideas, I want to jump to the exciting parts of of the action, because I do take action a lot, but I do skip steps and then I get overwhelmed because2600:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.437Rick Sessinghaus: I haven't taken the proper steps to go there, and when I get overwhelmed is when I shut down and that becomes kind of a flow blocker.2700:06:57.120 --> 00:07:08.220Rick Sessinghaus: so over scheduling is still a main problem for me. I you've talked about this before like 0 to dangerous and stuff like that is, I have a perception of what I can accomplish2800:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.325Rick Sessinghaus: in what time? And it is so far off, it's2900:07:13.950 --> 00:07:26.984Rick Sessinghaus: yeah, not good. So I believe I could get an email out, or I could do a a video for our company or something like that. And I say yes to it. And then you go, where the hell is that? Gonna go on the schedule and then that creates3000:07:27.510 --> 00:07:38.290Rick Sessinghaus: for me. Overwhelm is is my go-to emotion. When I'm I'm out of flow, and I've noticed that3100:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.950Rick Sessinghaus: focusing too much on what is urgent instead of what is important. So I haven't created boundaries for my schedule of3200:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.204Rick Sessinghaus: cause. I've only honestly done 3 really good flow3300:07:50.040 --> 00:07:59.438Rick Sessinghaus: blocks, and one was on the road because we had a rain delay, and I actually was at my hotel for a little bit longer and the other 2 have been at home where I3400:07:59.830 --> 00:08:08.639Rick Sessinghaus: I put in binareal beats and put the timer on at 45Êmin, and have found some some really good success with that3500:08:09.706 --> 00:08:13.929Rick Sessinghaus: and then from a values perspective.3600:08:14.520 --> 00:08:22.169Rick Sessinghaus: because values tend to drive a lot of my behavior. I'm noticing more and more of my value of servicing of others, which is a3700:08:23.140 --> 00:08:32.549Rick Sessinghaus: you could look at it as oh, that's nice, and that's you know, has pushed away all my other values like creativity and other of these things. So I feel3800:08:33.220 --> 00:08:39.185Rick Sessinghaus: there's a dopamine hit whenever I help people, or when I say yes to people or that and3900:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.191Rick Sessinghaus: that has has caused some issues there.4000:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.870The Alliance: I mean, can I stop you right there because there's so much here? And4100:08:47.980 --> 00:08:56.399The Alliance: I let's let me block through a bunch of these things like, there's there's a bunch of some of this stuff we can do very quickly. There's actually like4200:08:56.550 --> 00:09:02.940The Alliance: simpler solutions to some of this stuff than you would imagine so enlisting to you.4300:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.170The Alliance: These are things that are are clear to me. One.4400:09:07.180 --> 00:09:15.000The Alliance: Let's aim for 20Êmin flow blocks, not 45Êmin flow blocks and try to get4500:09:15.450 --> 00:09:37.862The Alliance: a couple more in just a couple, just because what you need are some anchor pieces to stabilize yourself a little bit. So let's go for smaller and a little more regular, so I think you shrink yours to 20Êmin. 25Êmin you will start. It takes about 15Êmin to drop into flow like even a little bit. So4600:09:38.970 --> 00:09:57.919The Alliance: You'll only have a short period of time in flow. But it's better than not. It's better than 3 times in the past 2 months. Right? So shrink, challenge skills, wise one there, 2. Second thing, this is really clear to me. And I was, gonna I'm teaching this. It's so funny. This is exactly where everybody is.4700:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.796The Alliance: This is going to be on the curriculum next week.4800:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.694The Alliance: but I literally just had this conversation with Stephanie, and I think I had it with somebody else over the weekend, and I'm having with you.4900:10:11.350 --> 00:10:20.019The Alliance: A lot of us have now started to realize that. Oh, when I'm at home and I could stay on the schedule, I get massive benefits. I get wildly dysregulated when I travel.5000:10:22.620 --> 00:10:31.749The Alliance: That's not just you, that's all of us. Right? So when I travel, for example, I have a totally different protocol. So I have5100:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.190The Alliance: one. I have my. So in a perfect scenario5200:10:38.390 --> 00:10:48.750The Alliance: on the road, I only try to do 3 things. I try to get a workout in 1st thing in the morning before the day starts, because it will won't happen in later. I try to get a 10Êmin5300:10:48.750 --> 00:11:08.909The Alliance: meditation, and at the end of my day, before I try to go to sleep, because otherwise I'm too jacked up from the people, so I won't sleep right. So I know. 10 to 15Êmin of a pause at the end of the day. It's hard to do it, but as long as I focus on the breathing I'm going to fucking calm down, I'm going to sleep so like those, and then5400:11:08.910 --> 00:11:35.730The Alliance: I don't ever. I don't write on the road I read. That's when I fill myself up with knowledge. So I get to my gold, or I get all the motivation goal stuff by reading. And I can bring a book. And then when I have 2Êmin, because I'm waiting a hotel line or I'm in the airport. What I just read and I get because I know I like you do. I can look at 5 books and go. God! If I read those 5 books.5500:11:35.740 --> 00:11:52.889The Alliance: I'm going to be so much more effective for my clients, and be this much smarter. I'm good like I know what happens on the back end to like 3 to 5 books. So I can literally take a 5 day trip and read 5 books, and because that I've I've removed everything else. That's how I do it. So I read less. When I'm home5600:11:52.970 --> 00:12:01.209The Alliance: right. I'll read 20Êmin to stock my pattern recognition system when I'm home. And then I read like mad men on the road, and I still outread anybody I know.5700:12:02.680 --> 00:12:21.839The Alliance: so like. That's how I think about it, and wait next step. Those are the good days when it's I don't holy shit. I'm on the road right. Well, the reading goes out. I have a minimal viable workout, so when I can't do anything else.5800:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.240The Alliance: I will do a hundred 50 push-ups and5900:12:26.695 --> 00:12:45.930The Alliance: usually like 50 V ups. Kind of thing or something like that. But it's always 150 pushups. That's my minimal workout, because I've discovered in 150 push-ups. My, I have to keep. I have to stay a certain size. Otherwise I break bones. So this is the minimum. And I found that just having that6000:12:45.930 --> 00:13:00.579The Alliance: in my travel routine, at least at the end of the day. I'm not as wayward and lost because I have some very simple, clear goals, and I hit it out. And what's more important is the consistency and a schedule you can stick to.6100:13:00.580 --> 00:13:09.389The Alliance: So one doing this stuff better to fix your fit your life a little bit more, because you're you're always a little too maxed.6200:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.570The Alliance: Okay. So we covered that. The next thing I wanted to say is and this is6300:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.389The Alliance: well, it's I think it's twofold.6400:13:19.590 --> 00:13:28.429The Alliance: So when it comes to other, I was, gonna say, you need the the problem. So6500:13:28.540 --> 00:13:40.330The Alliance: you can. You're saying yes to ever. I know what that dopamine hit is like I played. There's a point in your career. This is one of the hardest transitions for people to make is, there's a point in your career where you have to say yes to everything.6600:13:40.500 --> 00:13:50.480The Alliance: because you're coming up, and then you get to the be right, like, right as you're transitioning from. I'm this to I'm that as you're leveling up a bit.6700:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.180The Alliance: that6800:13:52.490 --> 00:14:05.270The Alliance: for me it was I was always saying yes, to like entrepreneurial side projects. Right? That would. That would be mine, right? I would always have like 11 going at once, or some like ridiculous number, because I was always trying to pay the fucking bills.6900:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.610The Alliance: And those are really fun projects at the front end of the movies generate a lot of juice.7000:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.330Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.7100:14:13.550 --> 00:14:30.069The Alliance: What is actually better is the juice you get from long term meaningful goals. And you know this because you've accomplished long, hard things before, and you know what they've got more juice. You just gotta shift your focus. So I think the things you have to. They said the same thing to somebody else today.7200:14:30.180 --> 00:14:37.160The Alliance: when it comes to your schedule and over scheduling, the way to think about it more than anything else is.7300:14:37.320 --> 00:14:45.040The Alliance: if I say yes to this? Does it advance my long term goals? If it does not advance your long term goals?7400:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.570The Alliance: It's an it's a no7500:14:48.430 --> 00:15:00.079The Alliance: to be a no, those are the things you have to start saying no to, because then you're just actually wasting time unless you need the money right. If you need the money, you say yes.7600:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.099The Alliance: if you if the money is not the thing7700:15:03.230 --> 00:15:17.140The Alliance: and you pass that barrier, then it's does it feed. If it feeds your long term goals. Fuck. Yeah. Like, if you see who you want to be in 5 years. And this helps you get there. Great, if not, that's cheap dopamine. And you're actually hurting yourself.7800:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.950The Alliance: and that's the dopamine. You say no to right. And the thing is7900:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.880The Alliance: as you start saying, no to that dopamine, you're an addict, and you're gonna want it. So your body's gonna seek it.8000:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.000The Alliance: So8100:15:33.930 --> 00:15:40.250The Alliance: gotta say, where do you? Where does dopamine come from? You're craving dopamine. Okay, I can get dopamine from sex.8200:15:40.530 --> 00:16:08.509The Alliance: I can get dopamine right? I risk taking created like that. You have to remember. You're an addict you've been feeding yourself with. Yes and other people so like you can start saying no to the other people. But it's not going to change until you have those long term wins. You're an addict. So you gotta feed the addiction a little bit. Aa doesn't take, say sobriety. They replace your addiction to booze and addiction to community and God8300:16:08.510 --> 00:16:18.450The Alliance: right. They swap it out. Bigger drugs, better drugs, more neurochemistry. You got to play that game with yourself when you're trying to make these changes. Otherwise the addiction.8400:16:18.450 --> 00:16:26.059The Alliance: The feeling is just going to take you backwards view, because the the other thing is this, there is a period of time, and you're in it.8500:16:26.260 --> 00:16:54.319The Alliance: where, as you make one of these transitions, you have to realize, it's going to be like, you're not going to get all your favorite drugs all the time, and you just have to be like, oh, I like, this is the part of the thing where I'm uncomfortable with this. I get it like, and you just kind of like you live with it for a little bit, because you have to make the smarter decisions. And they're always like they're weirder. And now so like for me.8600:16:54.570 --> 00:17:08.850The Alliance: like I just came through a period where, like nobody's really seen me since in our country, like you guys saw me for the Alliance. But the world hasn't like my social media, like all of it. Like literally. I went away for a year.8700:17:09.540 --> 00:17:27.600The Alliance: almost 2 years, build the lives to write a couple books to get the research where I wanted it to get before. Like you know what I mean. I can now start talking about where, where, and which way next. But it's because I spent 2 years. I disappeared from the world, and I built a whole bunch of shit. And now this shit is done, and it's starting to.8800:17:27.770 --> 00:17:35.589The Alliance: I'm out right, like the Alliance is happening. Papers are coming out, books are starting to write, but during that period. There was no8900:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.080The Alliance: be drugs9000:17:37.310 --> 00:17:50.789The Alliance: in the easy way, right like I wasn't even going into public. I did one flow for writers. I said no to most speeches unless they were paying over 50 K. Or something like that, because I needed to do this, and it felt9100:17:50.790 --> 00:18:12.309The Alliance: like I was on the edge of burnout for years, because that's what like. You know what I mean, because I wasn't all the you know. But it wasn't ski season. I was on the edge of burnout all summer long, like the reason we go to Hood in July is because I figured out that I'm gonna fucking. Stop skiing in like June first, st and by mid July, if I don't take a break.9200:18:12.360 --> 00:18:31.420The Alliance: I am gonna go fucking crazy and blow up my marriage right? And like I like I have to. I have to go take 2 days off and shut it down and like read books, and not talk to people, or you know, not talk about work, and whatever you should take those you you should be thinking this way a little bit for yourself. Does that make sense? It's helpful.9300:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.330Rick Sessinghaus: 100%. And and I think where.9400:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.089Rick Sessinghaus: from a from a personal standpoint of you know, I say struggle phase, because9500:18:39.920 --> 00:18:55.580Rick Sessinghaus: I'm very, very good at what I do, and within the coaching of golfers and athletes. I love doing it, and yes, just doing it. But my attention in the last couple months, and now has been to these other missions which excite me.9600:18:55.950 --> 00:19:20.514Rick Sessinghaus: But there's been struggle within each one of those right and and so as I told asked you last time about kind of an indoor facility. Looks like I am. Gonna do that. So I'm on the road. And now we found a place. It's perfect and now I'm putting, you know, getting blueprints for this and that, and it's exciting yet. There is going to be a lot of struggle coming up to open the place. My daughter is, gonna you know, kind of run it9700:19:21.270 --> 00:19:44.030Rick Sessinghaus: And so I think that's part of it is that you said it perfectly, that I am addicted to dopamine through saying Yes, and have people. You know. They're have a smile when I help them, and they tell me about what they did, and that's part of it. And then what I've noticed, and this is the pain point is, I'm being extremely disappointed in myself9800:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.720Rick Sessinghaus: for not meeting my personal standards of like integrity. Like, I say, I'm gonna do something, and I'm9900:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.040Rick Sessinghaus: slipping through the cracks way too much, and.10000:19:53.040 --> 00:20:07.269The Alliance: Yeah, you that like, that's that's a really bad habit. So you gotta like that. That. So let me ask you a question. Why like that's unusual for you, right? Like your high integrity. So like, why is it happening.10100:20:08.110 --> 00:20:13.739Rick Sessinghaus: The bandwidth. If we go challenge versus skills, the the challenge is so high that the bandwidth.10200:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.580The Alliance: Hmm.10300:20:15.580 --> 00:20:21.200Rick Sessinghaus: Need to do this has keeps put like yesterday is Sunday. I worked the entire day to the.10400:20:21.200 --> 00:20:39.559The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, I, okay, yeah, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now, it's the same point. I wanted to make you earlier. I don't mean to cut you off if I haven't on my notes, and I just the last thing I wanted to say to you. This is some. So this is, I'll teach you as my graphic design rule. Oh, because this is where I, fucking, learned this one. So10500:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.640The Alliance: I started to notice, there's graphic designers are very tricky if you're working with artists10600:20:45.800 --> 00:20:53.319The Alliance: and you're trying to give them. Hey, these 10 things I need to do on my website, Mr. Graphic designer, they actually won't do all 10.10700:20:53.420 --> 00:21:18.909The Alliance: They'll do the 1st 3, and they'll forget the next 7. And the reason is because when you talk, tell a creative what to do the 1st time they're going to start trying to solve the 1st problem. By the time you get to the 3rd problem they've stopped listening. They're like overloaded. Those are the problems they're going to solve. And that's it. They won't listen to you anymore. So you have to learn to talk to them very differently. Oh, and you have to accept something which is what kept happening is, I would10800:21:19.080 --> 00:21:28.659The Alliance: create timelines for graphic design based on how, when they oh, we're going to get this done in 6 weeks. No, if you tell me 6 weeks, you actually mean 3 months. I double it10900:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.010The Alliance: flat out, double it. I know.11000:21:31.250 --> 00:21:38.859The Alliance: because that's how long graphic designers actually take. So there's a rule. If you're on my team. If a graphic designer tells you it's gonna take a month.11100:21:39.050 --> 00:21:52.059The Alliance: Then we plan to do it 2 months out, like you just literally double it. What I'm telling you is you need the same rule for yourself. You have, you have to look at your projects. And you have to go in this project.11200:21:52.300 --> 00:22:05.740The Alliance: I have the skill. I have 80% skills, 70%. Right? So like coaching, you've got a hundred percent skills so you can show up. You can deliver your very best work all the time.11300:22:06.350 --> 00:22:30.569The Alliance: No sleep hungover. After stubbing your toe, you still got the shit right? So what you have to be able to start doing is you have to start assessing. I'm gonna like, honest like, oh, I gotta record a video. Well, how often have I read from a teleprompter, or written a script, or like done this in one take or like. If you tell me, I have to record a video I know I need to double11400:22:30.943 --> 00:22:36.420The Alliance: my time. If you need to. Me to run off a script versus QA. Your QA. With me.11500:22:36.720 --> 00:22:48.449The Alliance: Fine. But if you need me to do a script, we should almost triple it, because I'm gonna fuck that up so like I, there's certain things like I know about my like, you gotta you gotta like11600:22:49.140 --> 00:23:03.400The Alliance: plan for like the worst sort of version, and think about your time that way and say, Oh, I don't have the skills here. I don't want to be an optimist. I need to be a pessimist, because otherwise I'm gonna over schedule my life, and nothing's gonna get done11700:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.680The Alliance: right.11800:23:05.180 --> 00:23:22.880The Alliance: It is better to do a lot less and get things through to completion than do you go farther? People think you go farther in the problem with guys like us when you come up and you take the scatters kind of project and say yes to fucking everything it works, and you get like I was the busiest freelance writer in America11900:23:22.880 --> 00:23:39.289The Alliance: period period, the most, the best, paid, busiest freelancer in America, that, like I was the king of this shit, brought like nobody like nobody did more while running like while starting to try to start like 7 companies along the way, like I was the king of this stuff.12000:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.250The Alliance: and12100:23:40.490 --> 00:23:52.650The Alliance: I started to realize that, like it doesn't get you farther, picking 3 projects and seeing them to completion, actually gets you farther faster. But until you make that transition12200:23:52.650 --> 00:24:20.720The Alliance: you don't believe me. So your body is wired to do. One thing you know what the truth is, because you've seen it with your clients, too. You coach golfers, who are. I'm just a golfer. Then you've coached golfers who have complicated families and side businesses and like you've seen this in your clients. And you see, exactly like you know that like, if you've got a pro who's got a complicated family situation, you just actually added 6 shots to their handicap.12300:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.620The Alliance: right? Like, you know that like you like. I don't have to like you like.12400:24:24.700 --> 00:24:34.250The Alliance: It's true with you, too. The same thing that is true for the people you coach has got to be true for you, and you've got to think about it that way, though.12500:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.510The Alliance: The way.12600:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.429The Alliance: I'll just give you the really honest version of the story.12700:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.380The Alliance: I didn't. I never played with around with cocaine as a drug, ever.12800:24:48.530 --> 00:25:08.470The Alliance: And then suddenly, when I was 30 years old, it showed up in San Francisco for the very 1st time. It was dirt cheap, and I was exhausted from working all day, and had no social life, so like very early somebody was like, Hey, do you want some cocaine? And I had like 3 great nights, and I was like, Oh, no hangover, this stuff is great, and within like 3 weeks I was like, Oh, shit!12900:25:08.570 --> 00:25:28.269The Alliance: This is sticky I've got like I'm really like, I'm doing more. And this is no like. And it was really sticky for me because I like I wanted to go out and have a social life. I was so tired I couldn't meet girls, and then here was this tool, but it didn't work for me and I. So I started every time somebody would offer it to me, and it was everywhere13000:25:28.440 --> 00:25:39.110The Alliance: I would stop and I go, okay, how do you feel? Oh, you're going to lose 3 days. It's gonna right? Yeah. And I, when I would think through. So I started doing that when people offered me13100:25:39.490 --> 00:25:58.189The Alliance: jobs and entrepreneurial possibilities, I stopped. I would go oh, feel super good now, and it's going to feel super good, but I always so. Here's the one that I've learned with bet ventures. And you tell me if you're experiencing any different. This is the trap I run. I have learned with entrepreneurial efforts most fall apart at the 3rd problem.13200:25:58.780 --> 00:26:22.999The Alliance: 1st problem. Everything's like, Oh, I'm here for it now. We're having a problem. Let's lean in right? Second problem. Oh, fuck, we're having another problem. And by the 3rd problem it dawns on you that this new venture is actually problem solving because all branches are problem solving. And this is actually, you're doing the job. And it's 3rd point. It's usually when the team ballspark that's usually when, like early things die at the 3rd problem,13300:26:23.620 --> 00:26:51.419The Alliance: And so I like to look at an entrepreneurial venture. And I say, Okay, what am I? Gonna how am I gonna feel when we get to the 3rd problem, when it's no more, when this is just the problem. And it's like, because right, you're there like I could see you. You're there, basically. But 2 or 3 of the things that you you were trying to start. You're at that exact point, I'm saying, do it ahead of time when the offer comes your way, when the dopamine feels delicious.13400:26:51.900 --> 00:26:59.070The Alliance: hit it with. Think that's what I did with the cocaine. I was like, oh, I feel so good! I want like so much fun to do this now, but I13500:26:59.680 --> 00:27:12.639The Alliance: force myself to like, go to the bathroom, take a piss, stand there and breathe and think about how you're gonna feel tomorrow morning. Think about how you're gonna feel. Tuesday, right? And then I started doing a lot of stuff. And it works. It's beautiful because you just like.13600:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.000Rick Sessinghaus: Right.13700:27:13.000 --> 00:27:32.710The Alliance: You. You don't go for the easy dopamine because you're like, Oh, it's gonna wreck my fucking life, or oh, no, it's totally aligned with my mission. This is a good yes, this is a yes, I want to clear other stuff out of the way for it. But again, like you need to limit your missions. You got to figure out how many missions you're gonna be an effective and you don't get to move a new one on until an old one's complete.13800:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.326Rick Sessinghaus: Sure, sure. And I think I used to do13900:27:38.320 --> 00:27:45.970Rick Sessinghaus: future pacing in my mind like, Okay, what will that legal? And I haven't done that as well. Now that I look back, is that the yes and the dopamine feels great.14000:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.549Rick Sessinghaus: I'll figure out later would be just this. The mind says, I'll just figure it out later, and I think14100:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.220Rick Sessinghaus: I was.14200:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.689Rick Sessinghaus: And again, this is very personal is like I was embarrassed to be on this call with you today.14300:27:59.190 --> 00:28:05.189Rick Sessinghaus: cause I, freaking, haven't done the work, and I haven't done the thing. So I'm very disappointed myself that pain14400:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.760Rick Sessinghaus: is far greater than the dopamine hits that I've gotten in the last month.14500:28:11.170 --> 00:28:16.500Rick Sessinghaus: and I'm starting to see that correlation to where, when I say yes, like, you want to feel this14600:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.720Rick Sessinghaus: fucking pain like this. And be, you know. And so that's kind of the connection that what you.14700:28:21.720 --> 00:28:27.240The Alliance: Okay, I've got a sport. I've got a sports story for you. You're saying this, and I was like, Oh, my God! So14800:28:27.460 --> 00:28:41.700The Alliance: I've been skiing with Ryan for 10 years when it was when I when it was like more in our country when I realized I was gonna commit to this. So for years I follow Ryan around the mountain. If he does something, and I know I can do it, and I check it out.14900:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.609The Alliance: It will haunt me15000:28:43.770 --> 00:28:50.180The Alliance: literally every time we go skiing until I do it. Like it, will. It will ruin seasons15100:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.560The Alliance: if I'm like15200:28:51.810 --> 00:28:58.169The Alliance: I see him do something that I want to do, and I know I have it, and I check it out, or I don't do it. It will.15300:28:58.330 --> 00:29:19.550The Alliance: and it will fuck me up so much that I realized, oh, it's easier to deal with the terror of the thing in the moment than it is to feel this way afterwards. It's worse feeling this way afterwards. I regret it more, and that was the thing that liberated me the most. That's literally changed my skiing, because suddenly I was like, Oh.15400:29:19.550 --> 00:29:38.110The Alliance: it's actually I'm there's a trade here. It's not just you're going to do this thing. It's are you going to do this thing, or else there's a there's a there's a thing. And once there's a thing I'm actually, I'm making a I'm making a you know. Now I'm making a decision with consequences, and I have to treat it like that.15500:29:38.870 --> 00:29:52.629Rick Sessinghaus: And that's the key word is I don't think of consequences when I say yes, and now the consequences is affecting me as a person. I mean other consequences like risk taking. I'm like, even with this indoor facility. It's a risk.15600:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.710Rick Sessinghaus: I15700:29:53.830 --> 00:30:09.889Rick Sessinghaus: I know it'll work, but there's a risk still involved. And there's risk in this AI company that we're doing some stuff with. There's a risk. So risk is not. It's just now the disappointment in myself and my standards is is really where it's. It's hitting.15800:30:09.890 --> 00:30:27.630The Alliance: So. But see, okay, I gotta say this to you. And this is, you know, I it's funny. I've had this conversation with everybody. So if you were to come to me and say, Steven, how do you think I'm doing in the class right like you're really disappointed in yourself and blah blah, and you barely covered all that stuff. I would say.15900:30:27.890 --> 00:30:53.710The Alliance: I think you're doing just fine. I think you're perfect because you've learned a million things that you're doing wrong. You know exactly what right now looks like, you know, sort of how to get like like you. There's no way you have. You have to learn that you're gonna you're the way you're wired you were. Gonna learn this stuff the hard way, anyways. So what it looks like is we massively accelerated that16000:30:53.710 --> 00:31:03.459The Alliance: process so like it doesn't feel like victory on the inside. I get that it like you, you're gonna need some victories before it feels like victories. But16100:31:03.870 --> 00:31:16.919The Alliance: I know exactly what you're like. This is exact, like, you're probably right on schedule. Now, if you don't do anything about it if we like, if we get on a call 2 months from now. The next call we get on16200:31:17.590 --> 00:31:45.280The Alliance: it's a group coaching goal. But if you like, then we're then it's a different. Then I'm like dude. You wasted your money, and what do you? What do you do? You know what I mean? You you shouldn't. You shouldn't have done that, maybe, but I don't like I actually like the progress you're making, and I don't mind that you're in struggle because I don't have to deal with your emotions. I just can see it from the outside and go. Oh, I sort of like where you're I sort of like, I know it doesn't feel very good, but I actually like what you're the progress you're making. And16300:31:45.610 --> 00:31:54.309The Alliance: you came in the 1st time I talked to you. You had all this stuff going on, and you were the wild eyed boy from Free Cloud, and you were going to get your.16400:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.640The Alliance: It's kicked16500:31:55.830 --> 00:32:25.220The Alliance: now you're a lot more grounded. You have a hundred. You got processes to stay grounded. You see where you're screwing up, and you're not gonna like, I don't think you're gonna drive the car into the ditch anymore, like, you know what I mean, like, that stuff feels much more solid. So I know you might not feel feel good. And the thing is you think in your head. Okay, I came in at a 2. I gotta be at a 10 next time.16600:32:25.320 --> 00:32:50.989The Alliance: I don't think so, I think if next time you come back at a 4 or 5, you know what I mean like. Oh, I was. I got 2 20Êmin deep work sessions in a week, and I had a minimal recovery and workout protocol on the road, and, you know, read one extra book and gave myself permission to like. You know what I mean like, I think like those are big wins. Because for you it's just about consistency and16700:32:51.050 --> 00:32:57.280The Alliance: schedule management towards accomplishment. You know what I mean, and that's gonna you got a lot of shit going on.16800:32:58.050 --> 00:33:13.699The Alliance: It's not all gonna go away overnight like there's I mean like, you know what I mean, like you came in with like 3 really big projects. And the AI thing scale wise is gotta be where you go like this like that, right? The next version of you. You need these tools so like.16900:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.520Rick Sessinghaus: Sure, sure.17000:33:14.520 --> 00:33:25.659The Alliance: Like you're gonna run on the edge of overload definitely through this course, and and probably for like a little while longer. But you'll have the tools to go farther fast. You know what I mean, like.17100:33:26.880 --> 00:33:54.680Rick Sessinghaus: I appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah. Last thing I know, you gotta probably go on a call. But yeah, I think I I when I go up to like, I'm transitioning from one step to the next. There's resistance. Of what am I leaving? Because what am I leaving has served me quite well. And yet I know I want to keep getting more and more and more and more up there, and instead of letting go of that to now build on. I I keep carrying it with me. As it goes to.17200:33:54.680 --> 00:34:23.430The Alliance: Yeah. So loss aversion is real, right, really real. And it's hard. And it's by the way, it's hard in relationships, because your your partners and your kids and your friends have it, too. So like you have a vision of where you're going, they don't exactly see it. They see how stressed you are, and that the stuff work that you're doing now is working for everybody like. So you get like loss aversion pressure as well.17300:34:23.580 --> 00:34:29.533The Alliance: It's very like that doesn't go away. What actually solves that is17400:34:30.389 --> 00:34:45.149The Alliance: time spent in your primary flow, time spent in flow, having fun. Because it reminds you why you're alive. It just reminds you. All life feels good, right? And oh, if I play bigger it just it.17500:34:45.469 --> 00:34:50.289The Alliance: it show it basically gets you less afraid of where you're going.17600:34:50.650 --> 00:35:06.849The Alliance: It opens up new space. That's 1 way to do it. Another way to do it. And you know, this is like, this is vision boards. I get really wary because people start putting stuff that's unrealistic, and that's actually demotivating.17700:35:06.850 --> 00:35:28.149The Alliance: But it's never a bad thing if you're going someplace to do the like visualizations to see yourself there, because the more you can imagine yourself there and be there and feel there, the less lost. You're less scared right? Because the pattern recognition system, once you start seeing the new patterns right, one of the other things to do is as you move into that.17800:35:28.220 --> 00:35:56.790The Alliance: Give yourself a list of like these are going to be. These are the mile markers that tell me I'm on my way. So like loss. Aversion often can get pegged, we can in our head peg it to something final like I get paid for the new thing right? I always say that it's not real until I get the check right. Which is true, but it doesn't change the fact that there are milestones towards success that I like, I know, in a book.17900:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.020The Alliance: If I can get the book to 25,000 words.18000:36:00.470 --> 00:36:23.440The Alliance: God can't stop me from finishing it like you can't like up to 25,000 words I can get waylaid, and 25,000 words is like a 3rd of a book. It's nowhere for most people, but I know, because I've done this 14 times that if I get like, if I can get it to 10,000, I can usually get it at 25, and I can get 25. I can finish that book like no matter what what like.18100:36:23.440 --> 00:36:31.109The Alliance: I got that tool so like, that's what I'm staying is like, you gotta also like philosophers. You gotta you gotta go.18200:36:31.280 --> 00:36:39.879The Alliance: Oh, once the AI thing is recorded. I'm no longer involved at that fate. 1st win right? Like you gotta like.18300:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.070The Alliance: Yes, that's so.18400:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.590Rick Sessinghaus: But that.18500:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.199The Alliance: You know what I'm saying.18600:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.639Rick Sessinghaus: The crucial is once those 100 steps you asked me to do is that18700:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.190Rick Sessinghaus: each step along the way they're they're18800:36:49.630 --> 00:36:57.100Rick Sessinghaus: I took responsibility for that. I move forward on that. Doesn't have to be that the end end end goal has been achieved, I think, is gonna help me, too.18900:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.790The Alliance: Yeah. So you remember. So Steven's rule, Steven's rule is.19000:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.059The Alliance: I only care about the next step.19100:37:04.330 --> 00:37:11.839The Alliance: and I hope it's gonna be quick. I hope it's gonna go as fast as I want it to, but if it doesn't, I don't care.19200:37:12.580 --> 00:37:20.290The Alliance: I don't care, because the thing that I've discovered is like, as long as I do my job and do the thing that's on my checklist.19300:37:22.110 --> 00:37:47.960The Alliance: I will get where I want to go. It will happen automatically, right? And you, we sort of. That's a lesson we learn about ourselves along the way. We often don't believe it's true, right? You know, you got great at coaching by showing up and coaching every day, for, like, you know, a lot like you do. We do this all the time, but just don't believe like we like, just show up. Do the work. Don't fucking care because the real fun.19400:37:47.960 --> 00:37:59.269The Alliance: the real fun, the real way, you know, this shit is working is not on the way there. It's when you stop 6 months from now, and you look back and you go. Oh, my God! Look at everything I did. Wow!19500:37:59.290 --> 00:38:04.890The Alliance: How did I do that? Right? I'm having one of those like moments, Nat, right now, where, like19600:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.539The Alliance: it was slow growth all year, you know, on a lot of stuff. And suddenly, like19700:38:09.670 --> 00:38:39.470The Alliance: 3 books are done, and like a bunch of science, papers are sort of done, and we've got a blueprint for the business for the next like 3 years, and we've got the stretch goals, and we've got the like all of it, like I had none of that none of that like 6 months ago. And I like, even when we started the Alliance, I didn't have most of this stuff right? And so it's only I've had the same 2 months that everybody else has had. So like, I sort of know what you know what I mean, like the voodoo works, but it also, like19800:38:39.730 --> 00:38:46.420The Alliance: I wrote 4 papers science papers, the rough driver sort in like 3 weeks19900:38:46.600 --> 00:39:03.580The Alliance: sometimes that takes 5 years. You know what I mean, but like it like but it that was like I had to do the 5 year, the slow ones to get to like. Oh, now we've got the oh, we just applying this stuff here and this way and this way and this way. And you know so like20000:39:04.230 --> 00:39:30.480The Alliance: that. The point I'm trying to make is with this stuff is. It's exponential. So it's slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, and suddenly you're like, Oh, my fucking God! What just happened? Right? And it's always that way you've seen it in your life before. So assume that's gonna happen to you also, like you're in struggle. But when struggle ends you don't just go to a little bit more productive. You know what I mean. It's exponential. It goes like that's when it really explodes, though.20100:39:31.350 --> 00:39:39.840The Alliance: Don't beat yourself up. Try to like literally like, your goal is like 2% better, 5% better like for for the20200:39:40.180 --> 00:39:58.100The Alliance: I put so much pressure on myself as a skier. When I went into the nar country thing my goal had to be. I want to go one inch at a time.
