WEBVTT100:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.040brian camastral: Hey! Steven.200:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.620The Alliance: How are you, sir.300:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.059brian camastral: I'm good. How are you doing.400:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.669The Alliance: Good. So one thing just to be aware of so it doesn't surprise you if it happens. There's a fire burning 5 miles from us.500:00:44.396 --> 00:00:51.369The Alliance: So the whole valley is on high. Alert. We're like packed and ready to evacuate and but I don't like600:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.329The Alliance: I don't think that's gonna ha! If anything happens it will happen 4 o'clock this afternoon when the winds pick back up.700:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.135The Alliance: But800:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.250The Alliance: just in case I look at you and go. Oh, shit! I got to evacuate and and get off the phone. That's why.900:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.749brian camastral: If you need to do it, and you you don't even have to tell me. You can get up and run, and I'll know what's going on, and.1000:01:10.929 --> 00:01:11.409The Alliance: I just1100:01:11.410 --> 00:01:19.379The Alliance: this one? Yeah, like I, I'm not. I'm not too worried. As I said, everything's packed. So it's just like, Get the dogs in the car and go head north.1200:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.319brian camastral: One more check on that would it give you more peace of mind not to talk now.1300:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.090The Alliance: No, no, I actually love working now, because otherwise you think about the fucking fire there at the smoke. Now give me. Let me work.1400:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.490brian camastral: I just wanted to ask cause.1500:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.660The Alliance: No, I appreciate that. Thank you. No, I only managed it because I just didn't want you to freak out if I'd like ran away in the middle of the call, for no reason.1600:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.390brian camastral: Yeah.1700:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.090The Alliance: Anyways1800:01:46.035 --> 00:01:46.449brian camastral: Similar.1900:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.100The Alliance: I thought it was. It was. I had great fun hanging out with you. Thank you for coming. It was fun.2000:01:52.790 --> 00:02:02.137The Alliance: 2. I looked over I mean, we talked a little bit, and I looked over your call with Ryan and the notes the notes from that2100:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.859The Alliance: it seems like you're in a2200:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.269The Alliance: sort of heavy curiosity poking phase. Still, there.2300:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.799brian camastral: I think that's true. I think that. I'm I'm2400:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.980brian camastral: yeah. I don't know how to articulate. I have a plan for what to ask you today, but it's very.2500:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.199The Alliance: Go ahead. Let's let's jump into your plan, and we'll come back to mine.2600:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.590The Alliance: Let's do you.2700:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.540brian camastral: So last time I took, I just looked at the notes and I thought, Okay, there are 3 general takeaways, rework my goal stack, which I've done2800:02:37.497 --> 00:02:47.029brian camastral: and the closer in part, there's a lot of clarity. I've had to sequence things because there's just too much going on which2900:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.729brian camastral: you know, I think, is what you were seeing.3000:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.780brian camastral: Anyway, I've taken steps on that. It's had a positive impact.3100:02:56.221 --> 00:03:12.440brian camastral: I'm struggling, getting the long tails on some stuff complete because there'd be outside my ability to control it. You know, there's other. You have to corral people to do certain things sometimes to get legal closure on things, anyway. That's as good as I can do it at the moment.3200:03:13.446 --> 00:03:28.530brian camastral: I walked away with a shitload to read, and I got distracted chasing that. And it had a negative impact. So I corrected. But I have to dose my learning because I get too excited about stuff sometimes.3300:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.559brian camastral: So I I feel like I've3400:03:32.010 --> 00:03:49.940brian camastral: I've I've got that in a in a dosing pace that I can absorb. And you said, Go get 10 clients from my rolodex. I go. Oh, okay. Well, in the act of the 1st of reworking my goal stack. I didn't do that. I did go get one. I've got another meeting scheduled next week, anyway. That's background.3500:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.410The Alliance: Dude.3600:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.430brian camastral: Yeah. Go ahead.3700:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.790The Alliance: Yeah, okay, keep going.3800:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.519brian camastral: No, please. So what's the fucking.3900:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.049The Alliance: Dude fuck. Yeah, I mean, that's that's like, I think all that's really I mean.4000:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.349The Alliance: you came in sort of -oh.4100:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.570The Alliance: correct me if I'm wrong. But you came in a little more wandering in the desert than you are now. It's like you sound clear. You sound like you've got clarity, and I will tell you.4200:04:16.570 --> 00:04:41.339The Alliance: The dopamine is out of your voice which tells me you're no longer talking about a fantasy that you can't see, but really want. You're actually talking about something you can see, because the more crystallized it gets, the calmer we get internally right the less we get excited and expand dopamine because it's closer to in. And you're like, Oh, cool. This is what I do like you. Problem solve instead of aspire towards.4300:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.540The Alliance: And that's sort of what I'm hearing in your voice. I could be wrong.4400:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.169brian camastral: No, no, I've clearly I've totally4500:04:49.190 --> 00:04:57.640brian camastral: what's the right word? Let go of my that purpose thing. It's not gone. It just it's it has no use in my conscious brain.4600:04:58.404 --> 00:05:02.150The Alliance: I think I might not be articulating it. Well, but4700:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.850The Alliance: that's good. That's exactly that to me. That's like you. You can see it over there, but it's no longer your steering mechanism, because it gets in the way of the process.4800:05:11.850 --> 00:05:29.480brian camastral: Well, it. It's a total in the way of the thing. It's anyway. We let's not talk about it and give it more energy than it needs. Second, I am hanging out with you guys that you know the there were what 6 of us Alliance members plus your crew and your crew.4900:05:30.342 --> 00:05:34.369brian camastral: We had some nice time and something I'm starting to5000:05:36.070 --> 00:05:46.879brian camastral: be suspicious about in in a good way about like breakthrough. So my 1st question territories. I'm hoping to reduce my blind Spot a little bit.5100:05:48.430 --> 00:05:58.210brian camastral: so I don't know if that'll happen or not, but I'm imagining you might see some things in the course of this conversation that a little comment or 2 might5200:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.866brian camastral: might actually5300:06:01.240 --> 00:06:09.410brian camastral: have a massive contribution. But we don't need the pressure that. So I've read Mihaly Csiksentmihai's creativity book.5400:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.600brian camastral: That is a brilliant right, really beautiful5500:06:13.070 --> 00:06:23.769brian camastral: one of the things, probably the primary thing. I well, there were 2 big things. But the the one of the 2 big things I walked away from is there's this collection of I'm going to just call it a dozen5600:06:25.016 --> 00:06:26.630brian camastral: paradoxical. Continue.5700:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.529The Alliance: Yeah, that's I taught that I taught that. If you remember, in the starter class, that's where I got it. He did the original work on that.5800:06:33.770 --> 00:06:44.049brian camastral: Yeah, I I could see a lot of your flow research, collective and catalyst program roots here, and I know you've expanded. But the the connectivity of it was beautiful.5900:06:44.050 --> 00:07:01.500The Alliance: With that stuff. I just, I mean hopefully, when I taught it to you. Hopefully, I credited him in his book because I haven't like the binary personality was, that's a huge insight. Because creatives, because of that experience more empathy and are more emotional.6000:07:01.880 --> 00:07:20.699The Alliance: the more creative you get and the more iterative you get the more that happens. So you have to like. That's why it's so important to like active recovery. And like, really have those resets built in, because that gets amplified the farther you get on this path, I believe.6100:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.888brian camastral: Yes, so I my suspicion is that6200:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.140brian camastral: most, if not all, the the alliance cohort6300:07:35.043 --> 00:07:41.559brian camastral: is in this neighborhood somewhere. And they're on these paradoxical continuums.6400:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.840brian camastral: At least, that's what you were trying to screen for.6500:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.189brian camastral: But there's some interesting, energetic going on here trying to get to know each other.6600:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.400The Alliance: Is that a bad or a good.6700:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.956brian camastral: It's not, it just is I? I mean to me that6800:07:57.490 --> 00:08:04.010brian camastral: what what's if, when you create that, it creates the potential for more beauty and richness.6900:08:04.170 --> 00:08:10.560brian camastral: It just takes a little bit longer to activate it, and to figure out how to dance together7000:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.920brian camastral: in dying.7100:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.179The Alliance: Gonna I just so you know, just so you understand? Like, there's a plan7200:08:17.390 --> 00:08:27.090The Alliance: like I I don't. By the way, I have no idea if said plan is going to deliver said results. But there's a very specific plan. Next7300:08:27.370 --> 00:08:46.859The Alliance: 2 weeks from now we're gonna introduce. You're gonna partner with 2 other people are going to become your feedback partners for the rest of the ride. So you're gonna meet with them twice a month. And you're gonna just everybody gets 15Êmin or 10Êmin. These are my ideas, 10Êmin of feedback. These are my ideas. 10Êmin right? And that I want you. So if you've noticed7400:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.350The Alliance: the Sarah conversation was mediocre, Sarah's fantastic.7500:08:51.680 --> 00:09:19.920The Alliance: The Sarah conversation was mediocre because nobody was we met each other. We liked each other, but we come back to our lives, and you shut down a little bit. And so the Sarah conversation was awkward. That meeting the second one was Annie. No, everybody was actually totally fucking honest by then. Right? We the group, had gelled. People, had had phone calls and started to go know each other. Everybody really showed up for Annie, and it was the group that was different. Sarah's as great as Annie, but it was the group that was different7600:09:19.920 --> 00:09:43.306The Alliance: now we've come together again, and bonds are tightening, and I'm doing stuff. If you have for the people who haven't come in, I'm sort of like, Hey, you should get on the phone with so and so and so I'm building those things. Now, we're going to introduce feedback buddies, a couple more meetups and the finale. We should get you to a fairly tight group. I will tell you that. It's by in January.7700:09:44.180 --> 00:09:52.779The Alliance: for those who want to stay, and there's gonna be 2 tiers we're going to turn this into a year long program. So we're doing a second group.7800:09:53.020 --> 00:10:00.870The Alliance: And we're gonna the year long program, I think is, gonna be 25 to 30 people and cap there, there'll be like 5 or 6 vip slots.7900:10:01.107 --> 00:10:23.229The Alliance: And the rest is just kind of going to be because I want 2 different payment because we're otherwise, we're gonna lose some people who can't, who couldn't stay and we might lose some people, anyways, but I I wanted to like, see if I could work with people's I would, and that that wasn't something I ever planned on doing. But I was like, you know what? There's some really cool people in this group who make a little less money and let's do that. But so just so you know.8000:10:24.080 --> 00:10:43.600The Alliance: we're Bill. I'm I'm starting to see the collaboration work. I thought it would take about 4 months to get there. I was right. I think you need about 30 bodies in the room to really get. I think it's 36, which is what David Kelly liked in a design shop and it like he said, that was the best number.8100:10:43.980 --> 00:11:03.120The Alliance: I'm gonna like some. I'm aiming for a little under that, so we can have a little more intimacy. Along the way. But I like I'm seeing it. I think I'm like, I see enough of it that I'm confident now that I was like, okay, we can build. I can start to talk about and build towards where this is probably gonna go. For those people interested in long term collaboration.8200:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.360brian camastral: Great8300:11:04.819 --> 00:11:10.219brian camastral: I'm so curious about so many things, but I think we only have till 11, so I probably won't.8400:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.880The Alliance: I can give you an extra 10Êmin, because I just talked for 10.8500:11:12.880 --> 00:11:27.310brian camastral: No, so but I have some of ideas about creating intimacy faster. If there's time a different time. And you're interested just from my 15 or 20 years in building high performance teamwork. But8600:11:28.110 --> 00:11:35.670brian camastral: anyway, different conversation. So what? My and, by the way, if you never want to have it. It's okay, too.8700:11:36.410 --> 00:11:43.609The Alliance: It's I have to hear the ideas at some point when I'm not like in the middle of a crazy day. But my! My problem with8800:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.150The Alliance: that is like, I'm aware of those some of those techniques.8900:11:48.890 --> 00:12:13.160The Alliance: where in the curriculum it could get slot. That kind of stuff can get slotted, and what do you lose? If you artificially accelerate it? Is an interesting question, because you get people too high and collaborative dopamine in the front end. It doesn't. Everything else is a letdown, and it doesn't build. So those are the those are the things I'm trying to solve for. But I do want to hear your ideas just not now.9000:12:13.160 --> 00:12:22.279brian camastral: I have no attachment to you using them, they by the way, so that where I would like to go with the Blind spot is, I have some awareness.9100:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.166brian camastral: That I'm a weird, dude.9200:12:27.605 --> 00:12:33.400brian camastral: And I, you know, sometimes feel like I was never socialized.9300:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.769brian camastral: And I don't actually know how to articulate what I'm trying to say. But I I'm9400:12:40.930 --> 00:12:48.539brian camastral: able to interact at a very deep and effective level with people when I want to when I'm in that space.9500:12:48.740 --> 00:13:01.559brian camastral: But I find with my relationships there's always this, this gap. There's thing where I don't let people get closer than that even people I love, and I trust I keep this distance.9600:13:02.503 --> 00:13:09.391brian camastral: And even like there's even a little bit of this in my marriage. And9700:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.829The Alliance: I bet there's a lot.9800:13:10.830 --> 00:13:19.279brian camastral: Yeah, well, okay, so and and so I'm suspicious if you will, or I have my intuition9900:13:19.620 --> 00:13:29.480brian camastral: that this particular cohort is has shares this certain characteristic, and that there might be some high correlation towards the10000:13:29.870 --> 00:13:37.150brian camastral: paradoxic continuums that are, you know, similar that that creative people have10100:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.850The Alliance: So we screen for creativity, we screen for humor, we screened for smart, kind.10200:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.490The Alliance: funny, creative weirdos who are absolute killers in the world.10300:13:51.297 --> 00:13:59.980The Alliance: We screen for people with big dreams. So a lot of this is intentional like we. There are 6 people we asked not to join10400:14:00.280 --> 00:14:15.410The Alliance: who want it in. And we're like, not not for you. This isn't gonna work, and we only talked to like 60. So like we turn, you know, we were turning people down. But that was sort of intentional. To give you the feedback you want.10500:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.180The Alliance: So10600:14:17.280 --> 00:14:31.270The Alliance: it's not just me saying this. Everybody on my team has noticed this. So please hang me for it because I you mask real Brian, with coaching language.10700:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.710brian camastral: Oh!10800:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.500The Alliance: And10900:14:32.650 --> 00:14:39.949The Alliance: the other side of that is, you're the reason you feel like an outsider would, my guess would be. I have this too11000:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.770The Alliance: deep down. We like ideas a little more than we like people. Sometimes11100:14:45.110 --> 00:14:53.769The Alliance: we play like we like people, but we really would rather like ideas. Nature, that like that. Get that? You know11200:14:53.900 --> 00:15:00.479The Alliance: that this really immersive experiences. That's the stuff that gets us really fired up. And the people you're just like.11300:15:00.880 --> 00:15:27.410The Alliance: Oh, yeah, but like, I sort of know what you're going to do, and I know why you're going to do it. And you know, blah blah like I got my own blind spots, and I'm human, but I like I'm really good at seeing the chess game, and it's not that interesting to me. So we mask it. I mask it with science language. Sometimes you mask it with coaching language, sometimes right. But the truth of the matter is, we're only masking from ourselves. We're only performing for ourselves because11400:15:27.410 --> 00:15:41.567The Alliance: everybody sees through our mass, especially our partners. So they the people close to us sort of get insulted after a little while like, why do you? You know why? You know why? Why, there, now,11500:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.170The Alliance: The the flip side is, it allows us to be really effective in the room. So11600:15:48.850 --> 00:15:57.510The Alliance: how I try to get around that Brian is. And this is my way, maybe not yours.11700:15:58.220 --> 00:16:07.767The Alliance: once a day, because I I'm an introvert most of the time, and I'll stay home and I'll write, and I'll do my work, and I really won't go into the world, or I'll go to the gym and not talk to anybody11800:16:08.460 --> 00:16:16.709The Alliance: and really just like keep staying in my head the whole day, and I spend 45Êmin11900:16:17.120 --> 00:16:33.339The Alliance: at the end of my day after I do my creativity exercise. Before I go talk to my wife, or maybe vice versa, I try to reach out and have a conversation with somebody where I put down like a really like I have. There's a handful of people my life who, like12000:16:35.440 --> 00:16:47.440The Alliance: will call me on my all my bullshit, and you know what I mean. I just try to have a conversation. I reach out and touch somebody, and you know, put down those barriers and really like, but I'm gonna play a game for the next hour.12100:16:47.440 --> 00:17:08.609The Alliance: I'm going to give you, you know, a deeper, level, honest answer. Joan Didion says, Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth, and what she means is there's always a there's always a deeper level of truth like you tell the truth, and you're like, Oh, that there's a truth under that! And she says, Get to the one under that for good writing, and I think if you can get to the one under that also, you get good connection.12200:17:08.660 --> 00:17:33.260The Alliance: You notice this is how what I do in clap. I do where I talk about. I go to the deepest level of like the obvious feeling that we're all sort of feeling, but nobody wants to put a name on it. So I try to go there, because that's the honesty everybody sort of relates to, because you're then you're giving voice to something that they don't, really, you know. So they have a little bit of an Aha moment to like. Oh, this is, we're talking about that thing, and it usually gets people past the story.12300:17:33.260 --> 00:17:47.179The Alliance: and I connect better that way. That's just my kung fu. That's how I practice that. So that when I come into the world, and have to actually like honest to God, do a job and connect and and be there. I can.12400:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.030The Alliance: So I12500:17:48.130 --> 00:17:55.659The Alliance: try to flex that muscle once a day to keep myself human and slowly over time. I've learned to carry it into my marriage, but it like.12600:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.500The Alliance: I think that's about like finding the right language to speak in.12700:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.580brian camastral: Hmm.12800:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.799The Alliance: I'm massively self deprecating when I talk to my wife.12900:18:06.250 --> 00:18:11.340The Alliance: because it allows it keeps me very calm. And allows me to connect with her.13000:18:11.440 --> 00:18:38.580The Alliance: So like I really downplay everything. And we have, like we have names for things. I'm famous, Guy. When I go into the world right, you know she'll she'll be like, thank you for being famous, Guy, and I'll be like, I appreciate it, you know, and I'll be like, you know, today I was super famous Guy, and she that which means I've got a lot of dopamine. So stay away from me because I'll just annoy you. You know what I mean, kind of thing. So we've like, developed a whole language around telling the truth about13100:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.940The Alliance: the stuff that is problematic for us.13200:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.815brian camastral: Thank you for sharing that. I13300:18:47.810 --> 00:18:55.379brian camastral: that's gonna have to work on me a little. You know. I I feel some invisible resistance to me.13400:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.993brian camastral: Somewhere. I don't know.13500:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.649brian camastral: You notice I anyway, I.13600:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.340The Alliance: Can I ask you a different question, a separate question.13700:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.720brian camastral: Please.13800:19:05.720 --> 00:19:12.879The Alliance: When coaching clients come to you and say, Brian, you really helped me. You made a huge difference in my life. What does it feel like? Do you believe them?13900:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.689brian camastral: I do. Yes, it feels amazing.14000:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.229brian camastral: Oh, you mean sometimes. No, there's the sycophants that are just telling me stuff.14100:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.960The Alliance: But you can tell the difference, and when that when it's real it feels amazing.14200:19:25.960 --> 00:19:32.449brian camastral: When when it's real. I mean, I know I've changed some people's lives, and when they acknowledge that that's beautiful.14300:19:32.650 --> 00:19:40.250brian camastral: you know. But probably the majority of the time. There's some bullshit like I feel like someone's trying to kiss my ass. For whatever reason I.14400:19:40.250 --> 00:19:46.809The Alliance: Fair enough, fair enough. But let me ask you a question. Don't you want to be the kind of guy who, like14500:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.260The Alliance: tells the people. He loves14600:19:50.230 --> 00:19:57.110The Alliance: what they've done for him, and have them feel that good, too, like you. I know you do.14700:19:57.290 --> 00:20:09.029brian camastral: I do, and I've started making these these spontaneous attempts to do that like. When my son graduated from university, I wrote my wife. A thank you. Note with a long letter.14800:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.370The Alliance: Oh, that's so nice!14900:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.829brian camastral: Yeah. On father's day all the people that came and celebrated. I had written a card to about that.15000:20:15.830 --> 00:20:16.600The Alliance: So nice.15100:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.389brian camastral: Yeah, so.15200:20:17.390 --> 00:20:27.680The Alliance: So I by the way, I like, I think this is dope. So you saw the problem you're practicing. That's what I would do like you felt like, that's literally like, that's what I would do, because it'll like, especially like.15300:20:28.310 --> 00:20:34.279The Alliance: yeah. And and and so let me tell you something that I think is true, and on15400:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.799The Alliance: worth acknowledging out loud.15500:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.619The Alliance: We have to pretend 1st to become the people we want to be.15600:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.160brian camastral: Yes.15700:20:46.160 --> 00:21:11.140The Alliance: We don't get to stop pretending until we actually become that person. We then have to forgive ourselves for all the pretending, because it's shameful that we had to pretend so long, and all the exaggerated untruths we told out loud to like, really bolster ourselves along the way you have to actually forgive yourself for doing, because it's there's no other way to do this right where there's no vision, people perish, as the Bible tells15800:21:11.140 --> 00:21:17.870The Alliance: us, literally because the banister affect the way the brain works, you have to see it live into it, become it?15900:21:17.870 --> 00:21:30.909The Alliance: Then you get to put all that crap down. That's the actual process of entrepreneurship, of innovation, of becoming. It's all of it the truth of the matter, though. And this is what's gonna be really cool for you because you're gonna like this.16000:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.489The Alliance: So every time you got a level up.16100:21:36.330 --> 00:21:49.599The Alliance: you gotta shed that onion skin and get to a deeper level of truth telling in the world because you need more of actually, you, Brian, in the world to level up legitimately like you can't fake.16200:21:50.120 --> 00:22:03.089The Alliance: You can't fake that kind of ascension. It doesn't work that way. The market is is really fair, like the market gets spot. Sometimes they're bad at spotting fakers, but if the game that you want to play is really transformative.16300:22:03.250 --> 00:22:13.928The Alliance: The market eventually spots the fakers. They don't see Tony Robbins all the time they miss a couple other people, but Tony does manage to produce change in people's lives. It's just a stinky way of doing it.16400:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.480The Alliance: but16500:22:15.560 --> 00:22:40.279The Alliance: I always think you've got to shed that shit before you can move on, and we usually engineer crises in our lives to create the amount of trauma we need to shed a layer. You, if you want to be effective at this. Gotta like you gotta constantly be like trying to become that because the other flip side of this is, I always say this, there is absolutely16600:22:40.280 --> 00:22:50.969The Alliance: no healthy use for power and fame. If that use isn't just, it shortens the distance between. I got a cool idea in my head, and I created a thing in the world.16700:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.080The Alliance: That's the only real16800:22:53.150 --> 00:23:12.769The Alliance: thing we're trying to shrink with all like if you're safe and secure right. If safety and security is covered for you financially and with the relationships in your life, then you know what I mean. Then you're trying to solve for other things. I would ask you a question, cause I think the other difficulty you're having.16900:23:14.100 --> 00:23:25.679The Alliance: but I'm not sure. So I got lots of caveats around this, but I see it in you, cause it's very present in me. And Heck was for a very long time, so17000:23:26.120 --> 00:23:48.800The Alliance: I sort of always knew from the time I was 4 or 5 that I wanted to like be Guy on stage. In fact, I wanted to be the guy on stage, and the you know what I mean? Like my aspirations are. My ambitions are absurdly high, and, like for all player, empower money like all of it, like absurdly high, and they have been for my whole life. And17100:23:49.270 --> 00:23:58.221The Alliance: You know where the bright lights shine. I make them shine brighter like like it's just like that's sort of been my attitude all along.17200:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.260The Alliance: which is kind of embarrassing and shameful.17300:24:04.680 --> 00:24:24.529The Alliance: but it's very much built into me, and it's built into me for a terrible reason I didn't belong. I didn't fit in. I was an outsider. I wasn't safe, and so I wanted to be. If I could be the center of attention, and everybody could like me. Maybe I'd be safer right like, that's where that 1st came from in me. And so17400:24:25.080 --> 00:24:31.719The Alliance: that's a typical outsider reaction. And so when I see people who want to play big17500:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.500The Alliance: and they want people to notice a little bit.17600:24:34.980 --> 00:25:04.459The Alliance: I often ask, is that about I didn't belong then. So I want this to fill that hole because you don't get to fill that hole. Family never like none of those things are going to fill that hole. The only way you fill that hole is by like sort of talking it about out loud. So I spent a really long time saying things like, you know, I would like your uninvited attention for what's about to happen, mostly because I need to hear the inner child within me and your attention. You know what I mean. I'll make some kind of like absurd joke out of17700:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.419The Alliance: the thing that I know I'm doing. That's yucky and17800:25:08.560 --> 00:25:29.020The Alliance: put it out there in front of the fact that I'm probably going to do it anyways. So now I've named it and like it's. And then throughout the conversation be like, see, exhibit A, and it starts to neutralize it a little bit over time. So I don't know if that belonging is your demon that was mine. But whatever it what it is, that sort of has created that17900:25:29.020 --> 00:25:39.719The Alliance: in you, it's got a shadow side right? It's got a good sense got a shadow side. Figure out what that shadow side for you is, and see what happens when you name it, before you go into the conversations.18000:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.389The Alliance: In a sense, it might18100:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.119The Alliance: shrink its power a little. Does that make any fucking sense.18200:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.139brian camastral: It makes a ton of sense. I I think that I you might have just18300:25:52.400 --> 00:25:59.280brian camastral: uncovered the a shadow side that I you know I've always claimed I don't want the limelight.18400:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.680brian camastral: and as I think about this, I am18500:26:03.430 --> 00:26:10.789brian camastral: you know I've had some pretty strange but extraordinary experiences with my Soulcraft work, and one of them was that I,18600:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.369brian camastral: And one moment I dropped into this underground medicine cave and18700:26:15.740 --> 00:26:29.229brian camastral: found myself in the womb of my mother while she was pregnant with me, and a moment that she actually became conscious she was pregnant and experienced the intense shame18800:26:29.985 --> 00:26:35.380brian camastral: of being unwanted in her life because she had just started dating my dad.18900:26:35.690 --> 00:26:42.370brian camastral: So they they were like a new couple, and it was in a time and place where19000:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.729brian camastral: you know, on premarital pregnancy and all. Blah! Blah blah! This stuff, anyway.19100:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.710brian camastral: that moment didn't last long, right? She didn't abort me.19200:26:52.910 --> 00:26:53.410The Alliance: Right.19300:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.879brian camastral: They? They ran away from home and eloped right, you know.19400:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.139The Alliance: Are you telling me you have epigenetic trauma because your mom didn't want you for a brief moment in time.19500:27:03.150 --> 00:27:12.069brian camastral: I have a feeling that there is some of that. Yes, but on the flip side of this I feel like I've experienced this double helix throughout my life19600:27:12.300 --> 00:27:19.490brian camastral: of people wanting me. And then, when I push edges where things aren't accepted, traditions19700:27:20.034 --> 00:27:28.929brian camastral: the majority of people don't want that. So I feel like I'm on a yo-yo here, because sometimes I push for transformation19800:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.550brian camastral: faster than people can get comfortable with it.19900:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.787The Alliance: Okay, God, it's fun talking to you.20000:27:38.050 --> 00:27:44.076The Alliance: we have a we. We have a lot of overlap in in things that we've we've done, and we've noticed20100:27:45.050 --> 00:27:55.939The Alliance: So I stopped coaching people in my early thirties because I noticed that I'm captain. Go big.20200:27:55.990 --> 00:28:24.128The Alliance: and when people get around me. I inspire them to live a bigger life, and as a result they adopt my risk tolerances which is insane. I like my risk. Tolerances are off the chart, and my skills are pretty off the chart. So like, I've got crazy risk tolerances. But I got there slowly over time with a lot of skill to back them up, and people just adopt them and fuck themselves up emotionally. Dude. I stopped coaching people for this very reason.20300:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.650The Alliance: And20400:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.460The Alliance: in a sense20500:28:32.620 --> 00:28:49.493The Alliance: you're getting similar pushback. I'm like, cause that was. Also I was very impatient. It's still my problem with people in the Alliance who can't keep like I'm fuck. I'm like what the fuck is wrong with you. Your best self is right, like fuck just fucking. Go, come on! We can all see this. Come on, you know. And20600:28:50.370 --> 00:29:01.709The Alliance: that's the hard part of doing my job. But the truth of the matter is, and I said this the other day somebody asked me, How do you get a team to move at speed right? And one of the things I talked about was, I said, look.20700:29:02.720 --> 00:29:25.800The Alliance: how long did it take you to learn to move at speed personally? And I moved really fast, but there was a period of like 3 to 5 years, where I really worked that out in a very specific way, and I would sort of double my process speeds every 6 months and freak out and panic, and whatever it took, like 3 years for me to believe in my own ability to move faster and faster and faster as was needed, and that it was an elastic capability, and I possessed the skill.20800:29:27.070 --> 00:29:42.159The Alliance: You can't ask people to do something faster than you did, because you're really into this. You have all the information, and you're good at it. So like, if it took you X amount of time to do the transformation, you can either20900:29:42.240 --> 00:29:58.759The Alliance: find people who can move at that speed, and those are the people you keep counsel with, but everybody else. If you try to make them move faster than your speed, they're pissed at you. All you can do is actually live the truth.21000:29:58.930 --> 00:30:13.839The Alliance: And so they you be. The change you want to see in the world. And they look at that, and they go. Oh, my God! That's fucking cool! I want that. And then they ask you how you did it. That was when my wife when I like. I stopped trying to get inspire my wife to like21100:30:14.550 --> 00:30:39.360The Alliance: move faster on problem solving stuff. I just started. She watched me build businesses and rebuild businesses, and solve massive problem over and over and over again at speed. And finally she was like, Oh, you're really good at just like wading right into the fire and solving the problem, and next next and oh, that's neat! How do you do that? And suddenly but it took fucking 10 years, and if I tried to speed it up, she just fucking hated me, I mean hated me, resented me. There's no21200:30:39.360 --> 00:30:47.611The Alliance: there's no fix unless unless unless and this is the only thing I would say to you about the trauma story is21300:30:48.280 --> 00:31:12.000The Alliance: Some narratives you can't get out of until you start telling a different story. So sometimes you got to get them telling a different story about themselves before they can even imagine the transformation. So you're really so like rather than pushing them towards transformation. You sort of want to creatively nudge them towards that different story, and then sort of see what happens is what I've been told.21400:31:12.890 --> 00:31:24.710brian camastral: Well the power of that. There was a different story. I was trying to heal on some medicine journeys a week or 2 before the Alliance kicked off.21500:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.859brian camastral: and it was so powerful that they they lost their grip on me.21600:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.850brian camastral: So I haven't circled back to write the new story just actively to rewire my insides.21700:31:37.454 --> 00:31:40.929brian camastral: Yeah, about this. This unwanted wanted thing.21800:31:40.930 --> 00:31:48.910The Alliance: Hey? Can I ask one last quick? One quick question while you're saying this? Because I don't want to lose this thought. What is the most grounding thing you do for yourself.21900:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.400The Alliance: like what grounds you? The most.22000:31:51.400 --> 00:32:00.129brian camastral: Walking in nature, being in nature, exercise in nature, somewhere in nature, just out there. It's just this, there's nothing like it.22100:32:01.270 --> 00:32:01.840brian camastral: Yeah.22200:32:02.520 --> 00:32:08.539brian camastral: yeah, okay, this is beautiful. I'm conscious of time. And I have one or 2 more questions that might.22300:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.390The Alliance: So let's let's let's rapid fire.22400:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.820brian camastral: Yeah. So the on on22500:32:16.560 --> 00:32:36.289brian camastral: So this is a meant is deep respect for you. So when I was in Soulcraft. I wanted to start up my own version of that. That was different, because I I just didn't buy some of the limp, constraining things. So I asked Bill Plotkin if he minded if I named a company lifecraft, he didn't. So that's my shell. But anyway.22600:32:36.580 --> 00:32:42.780brian camastral: with respect to taking myself back out to the world. I spent most of yesterday just22700:32:43.260 --> 00:32:49.199brian camastral: writing a positioning document, and when when you22800:32:49.310 --> 00:32:56.669brian camastral: or people affiliated with you and the flow research collective coached corporations on flow.22900:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.810brian camastral: Well, one, are you doing that anymore? Because I I just I just don't want to step on your toes in any way whatsoever. And I know.23000:33:03.810 --> 00:33:04.130The Alliance: So.23100:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.710brian camastral: Can't be you. So this is about respect.23200:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.630The Alliance: I appreciate that I will tell you what we're doing.23300:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.150The Alliance: What I've been doing. Is, I've been doing23400:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.239The Alliance: have to. So I there's 2 offerings right now, for if you, if you're a business, you want to try and be one23500:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.440The Alliance: twice a year I've been doing 3 day. CEO boot camps23600:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.970The Alliance: like 40 to $50,000 a person23700:33:30.020 --> 00:33:56.779The Alliance: 3 days, you know you you what what you experience in a day? We do. 2 more of those right? It's all it's. It's a tremendous amount of information, really fast. But most Ceos don't have 4 months, and they got a weekend, and somebody need. You know what I mean. Somebody knows that like if I can get them 1% more effective in a weekend that the impact on Roi is huge. You know what I mean. So like.23800:33:56.780 --> 00:34:06.449The Alliance: There's that with the regular with the regular businesses. I've been doing a 3Êh workshop a half day workshop, which is23900:34:08.139 --> 00:34:12.900The Alliance: pretty solid and pretty effective as a starting tool. I know.24000:34:13.070 --> 00:34:37.740The Alliance: Brian, that it needs follow on coaching. It's gonna need a once a month coaching call with somebody not named Steven Collar for like a couple of months. Follow up. I know. That I'm going to not use a single coach in that room. I'm gonna rotate. I want to use 2 different coaches or 3 different coaches, because I don't want them to get attached to one coach. That's bad for my company, and it's bad for the coaches.24100:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.889The Alliance: Oh, man!24200:34:39.480 --> 00:35:05.910The Alliance: And so that. But that, and we're not doing that right now. But we will be doing that probably in a year. I didn't want to get anywhere near business coaching until the collective itself, so the business itself doesn't shut down completely till August one. Basically, the bank had everything else. So I need to have the training side completely put to bed with all the partners completely separated before I can go back into verticals that I was in with them.24300:35:05.910 --> 00:35:11.240The Alliance: So I'm being very patient with them. It's also my least interesting24400:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.970The Alliance: thing. So one of the other things that I've been24500:35:15.150 --> 00:35:23.410The Alliance: tinkering with in the back of my head is some kind of licensing agreement24600:35:23.860 --> 00:35:33.959The Alliance: with select individuals. I don't want to be in the coaching business. I don't want to monitor coaches. I don't want to like do anything like that. I don't want to train them per se. But24700:35:35.670 --> 00:36:03.909The Alliance: there might be. There might be something that way. You know what I mean. Like, I honestly could put together a really complicated test knowledge test that like if you could pass. And I like you know what I mean. I like you, and we you coach somebody for a little while I might let you. But that's what we're thinking about. I don't know what that's gonna take place, and because it's not a real high priority for me but I appreciate you asking. I also think, Brian, my mission is to split, spread, flow around the world so.24800:36:03.910 --> 00:36:14.732The Alliance: and just spread this work everywhere, and I'm an abundant guy. I think there's plenty of room at the top, and I also don't think anybody's gonna catch me anytime soon. But24900:36:16.270 --> 00:36:23.010The Alliance: you know, or if you start to catch when you feel bad about it, you can hire. You could put me on your board as a consultant and pay me. You know what I mean like.25000:36:24.730 --> 00:36:34.669brian camastral: Yeah. So that was perfect. So what I assumed is that you were engaging at a fairly high level for short bursts of time25100:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.609brian camastral: for a lot of money, providing a framework with some tools.25200:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.579brian camastral: and then that you walked away, which is kindly kind of what you said.25300:36:42.780 --> 00:36:54.010brian camastral: I think. And then, if you add in the second product here, it would really be a short term like, follow up for a couple of months with a couple of different coaches, and then you'd still walk away.25400:36:54.730 --> 00:36:55.530The Alliance: Probably.25500:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.590brian camastral: Yeah, so.25600:36:56.950 --> 00:37:06.239The Alliance: Because I don't. So here's the thing, Brian Brian. Here's the problem I don't ever want to solve for so if you're asking for like, where in the market am I never going?25700:37:06.340 --> 00:37:36.280The Alliance: Is I am not built for, nor do I interested in holding somebody's hand across the finish line. If they work in corporate America. I'm just not interested enough in what those people do for a living. If it was a creative leader, you know what I mean if you were the lead singer of, you know, pick Band X, and you came to me and said, Hey, would you work me for a year to get to the super bowl halftime show, I would say, Yeah, that's my kind of jam. I'm just not like you would have to. You would have to be so in the environment25800:37:36.280 --> 00:37:45.646The Alliance: space. So in my shit for me to do that. So that's a gap to me. I don't. Wanna I? There's a guy I work with who I25900:37:46.170 --> 00:37:56.159The Alliance: I like his, or he works on courage. At a really big global level. And I, he's got a big organization behind him. And he just partnered. He's partnering with a big British26000:37:56.300 --> 00:38:12.289The Alliance: company as well that I like and he he's sort of set up to long term. Deliver this and do that kind of monitoring and check-ins, and whatever what I am really trying to figure out is what is the best way26100:38:12.870 --> 00:38:27.339The Alliance: to do accountability at a distance inside of companies. Right? So the questions I'm trying to solve for is I wanna I wanna get them excited, and I want to be able to pass them off to a partner. I want to get a26200:38:27.580 --> 00:38:39.515The Alliance: cut of that existing revenue, and I wanna be able to trust. The partner is not going crazy and but I don't wanna do that kind of long term monitoring26300:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.880The Alliance: cause it's just not. It's not my strong suit. It's not my interest. Other people are. Gonna be better at it.26400:38:46.450 --> 00:38:47.939The Alliance: Other people like that.26500:38:48.190 --> 00:39:10.199brian camastral: Yeah, you. This was perfect. I understand now. And so I think that because we're not the same person at all right, I could never be you or as good as you, because, one, you're you're so far ahead of me, and you're you're gonna outwork me on this, but I don't aspire to be you. I aspire to be the best version of me.26600:39:10.690 --> 00:39:16.646The Alliance: Yeah, no, I don't want you to be me. I like I. My biggest problem has always been with coaches is26700:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.690The Alliance: They want to freestyle and do them.26800:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.600The Alliance: And I want to follow the biology.26900:39:23.740 --> 00:39:29.770The Alliance: And so that's the problem. What I found with Mo. When I'm working with most coaches is like27000:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.580The Alliance: you if you've got27100:39:31.800 --> 00:39:51.590The Alliance: any year on voodoo that, you know, like there's some I like people to be able to be them and honest, and all that stuff. But I like. That's where it starts to get wayward, because the better the the better the mind with the less they stay. Exactly. You know what I mean. I'm doing what I need. And like27200:39:52.340 --> 00:40:15.439The Alliance: Mo, we. I know the protocol works. You know what I mean. I've trained so many fucking people. So I like that. It's a limiting factor with like, you know what I mean. There's a lot of high powered coaches sort of in the alliance. And one of the reasons that I built the Alliance is because I figured there's probably gonna the solution to my what to do with big with business and business training is going to come out of it sometime in the next 2 to 3 years.27300:40:15.740 --> 00:40:26.569The Alliance: But I really have to sort of like, know and trust and like, and you know not. Think you're crazy, and think you know your shit, and can represent the science. And you know blah blah.27400:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.880brian camastral: So I feel like my positioning is one. I've been the CEO at the highest levels and worked up from the ground level27500:40:34.050 --> 00:40:45.969brian camastral: in whatever I have a lot of breadth and depth there I'm recognized as a elite high performance team builder Donnett got the data.27600:40:46.450 --> 00:40:54.450brian camastral: I feel like the upscaling I've been doing here allows me to put language to flow, or soulcraft, or stuff27700:40:54.740 --> 00:41:02.830brian camastral: with words they can hear where I can bring some credibility to differentiate myself from other people like me.27800:41:03.010 --> 00:41:10.710brian camastral: So I'm thinking I would go in with 3 products. I can help a leader. I can help Leader with his team. I can help a leader with his company.27900:41:11.090 --> 00:41:29.000brian camastral: and I have walked this walk, so I know how to transform the entire enterprise culture and how to build the protocols ongoing where we can deliver results beyond reasonable expectations. So I think that's what I'm my 1st thing is to just start doing some work.28000:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.120brian camastral: I think.28100:41:30.120 --> 00:41:39.339The Alliance: Yeah. So this is the other thing. I this is, I'm glad we got here, because this is the one thing I was gonna tell you and I was thinking about it after we talked. The event was28200:41:39.850 --> 00:41:46.962The Alliance: especially with with guys who think a lot. Anybody who thinks a lot lives in their head.28300:41:49.400 --> 00:42:12.140The Alliance: If the ideas are delicious and you keep iterating, you gotta I pressure test everything as fast as I can, so like when it comes to. Oh, I want to do this in the world. The 1st thing like we came up with the plan for the second Alliance, right for where it's gonna grow. The 1st thing Chase said to me is, okay. This looks like an interesting outline. Let's test it28400:42:12.230 --> 00:42:36.939The Alliance: with the customers. So like, that's like it was. I did the outline. We're immediately testing it with the customers. We'll probably iterate a couple of times before we actually announce it. But I'll talk to you. I'll talk to a couple of other people like, Hey, this is sort of coming, just, you know. Just so people sort of know a little bit what we're thinking. So we can start to see those conversations. But I like, I remember in, I always think about Google28500:42:36.940 --> 00:43:00.049The Alliance: when they launch Gmail. It's the 1st major agile product right before them. Email systems are 200 features. They're giant Google launches with 4 features and uses a agile fast feedback iteration cycle. Now. They abuse that privilege tremendously these days. But it's a really. I always think of Mike Tyson. Everybody's got a plan until they're hidden face28600:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.829The Alliance: or punched in the mouth.28700:43:01.950 --> 00:43:06.929The Alliance: So like, whatever your plan is around coaching right? Get to like28800:43:08.050 --> 00:43:14.290The Alliance: step number 4. No, you know, Tony Fidel, if you've never read, build, read, build.28900:43:14.530 --> 00:43:41.625The Alliance: It's gonna take 3 iterations to get a product to lock in a product. This is true with trainings for sure. Right? You need 3 groups of people through a training before you can even figure out if you're like, are you saying the right stuff in the right order, let alone. Is it working? Right? So, those are the things like immediately. Yeah, yeah, I think you should start doing that for sure. And I wanna say out of everything that I've heard you say. I29000:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.960The Alliance: the place! I actually think29100:43:48.750 --> 00:44:11.570The Alliance: you're best suited for. You just said it. You just didn't hear it like. Yes, you could train Ceos. You could do that and you could also train Ceos and their teams, and then you could train Ceos and their whole companies. But that's actually not the thing here. And you sat in the fucking meeting with Andy Walsh and heard him say it.29200:44:12.180 --> 00:44:35.540The Alliance: What we need most in this AI world is fast performing fast, forming high performing project based teams. They have to come together quickly. They have to perform at a superstar level. They have to be able to disband and pass on their knowledge base into like whatever right? He said. They said that, and I I don't disagree29300:44:35.540 --> 00:44:46.880The Alliance: so in everything I heard you just say the thing that caught my attention the most was, I'm really good at bringing a team together really quickly. It's high performing high performance team.29400:44:47.300 --> 00:44:53.289The Alliance: That's interesting because you can. One29500:44:53.870 --> 00:45:02.880The Alliance: make a very good case that any high performing team needs autonomy, and that means short chain reporting. So you want the CEO29600:45:04.050 --> 00:45:27.659The Alliance: and a dude running the team, or a gal running the team. And that's the link right like this is Skunk works 101. So you want to click. So you got to work with the CEO. Anyways, your product is, I can build you high performing teams. My rule is, it's the CEO and the fast coming together. High performing team, like, you know, that's what I would start. That's the thing you said, because there's a lot of other fucking people in those other spaces, right and29700:45:28.355 --> 00:45:33.900The Alliance: unless you think soul craft is enough of a distinguisher.29800:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.539brian camastral: I do resume.29900:45:35.540 --> 00:45:56.230The Alliance: Your resume, and you're not wrong. Your resume is dope. But what I've also heard you say is, you want to make the biggest impact. So if you want to make the biggest impact, you've got to get ahead of the market, figure out where you are fucking most needed. Where does the world really need you? Where's a blind spot that they're not seeing where you can have an impact30000:45:56.230 --> 00:46:05.719The Alliance: and then start playing with the right people? Right? That's really what we're talking about. And I think if you can bring Ceos and build fast performing teams to it.30100:46:05.730 --> 00:46:32.450The Alliance: And you know, train adaptive flexibility in a world, you know, gone mad a little bit with a lot of opportunity everywhere. Especially if you get a little AI conversant in there. That's a don't fucking offer to me. That's sexy. That's the thing you said that I was like. That's sexy, and you have proved it, and you've done it, and that's the thing that not many there aren't that many people who are super skilled at. It's I like.30200:46:33.480 --> 00:46:52.629The Alliance: I like people in very tight. You know what I mean. I'm the neurobiology of Flow Guy, to fucking. There's nobody else in my category like I'm alone in my fucking category, and I do everything I can to stay alone in my category when you see the next 5 papers that are coming out from us over the next 6 months.30300:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.780The Alliance: Understand that that's what I'm doing30400:46:54.890 --> 00:47:05.199The Alliance: like. I'm also publishing a novel and a new book with Peter Diamandis. I am pointing out to the world. There is nobody in my fucking category. You gotta hire me.30500:47:05.770 --> 00:47:14.499brian camastral: So great. This is beautiful. It went where I didn't expect I love it, and this will set up. The next conversation beautifully.30600:47:16.390 --> 00:47:22.850brian camastral: good. My last question, which is really more of polite about the meet up in Hood River.30700:47:23.690 --> 00:47:29.929brian camastral: I'm assuming you're gonna interact with us the 16th and 17, th and then you're out again.30800:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.930brian camastral: And here's the question behind the question.30900:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.959brian camastral: I've offered to some of the cohort that they can come and hang out at my farm.31000:47:38.190 --> 00:47:47.270brian camastral: Okay, I'm just saying it out loud to you, assuming that you want to stay away from that as much as you can, because you're so busy with so many priorities.31100:47:47.530 --> 00:47:59.820The Alliance: So what Ryan and I talked about because we had this discussion is both of us were like, wait a minute. If you've got a fucking lavender bar like we want to see. That depends on close it is. But so both of us were like I could see one day.31200:47:59.820 --> 00:48:22.680The Alliance: Personally, we're like. By the way, I'm just going to fucking. Hang out. I'm literally like this is, I am so off duty. This is like, this is my vacation. And I normally would invite like, I really like you guys. So I was like, Okay, you could come. But like, this is one where I would normally like. Just go with Ryan and not talk to anybody. I'm gonna ski. I'm gonna smoke pot and like, read a book31300:48:23.060 --> 00:48:34.220The Alliance: that said skiing is done at one o'clock every day, so you need an afternoon activity after you Nap. And I think going to a lavender farm sounds fun. So that's what I was thinking.31400:48:34.360 --> 00:48:41.120brian camastral: Okay, I sold the Lavender Farm, but I I still have a couple of acres of lavender on the farm, I still own.31500:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.019brian camastral: but anyway, I.31600:48:43.020 --> 00:48:49.240The Alliance: By the way, I want you to know, Brian, if I get if we get evacuated, my house actually Burns.31700:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.640The Alliance: I'm moving up to your farm dogs.31800:48:52.640 --> 00:49:01.439brian camastral: You. You can go to my farm with 20 dogs as long as you don't hurt any wildlife in any way whatsoever, which you won't right. But.31900:49:01.440 --> 00:49:08.120The Alliance: Well, I but I won't hurt any wildlife, but a couple of our dogs are hunters, and they will catch mice.32000:49:08.120 --> 00:49:18.039brian camastral: Yeah, I don't care about little stuff. It's just that your dogs are animals, too, and they have that their own way of of interacting with their fellow.32100:49:18.040 --> 00:49:31.429The Alliance: Oh, I'm kind of I was kind of joking, because, like, I mean, if we got to run someplace, we got to run someplace with a big fence yard where our dogs are very away from other anything with their Hospice rescues, with like emotional issues.32200:49:31.640 --> 00:49:39.859brian camastral: Well, there are no well, anyway, if you got an emergency and and you're want to explore the possibility, you can call me so I guess I'll.32300:49:39.860 --> 00:49:51.489The Alliance: I appreciate that, because I may like we've got. We've got a near place. Then we've got a slightly I've got. Oh, I can run to Ryan's and Reno but sometimes the fire is like we get trapped. Then I'm coming to Oregon.32400:49:51.490 --> 00:49:56.169brian camastral: I'll talk to Ryan offline about this cause. I didn't want to exclude you.32500:49:56.170 --> 00:50:04.139The Alliance: Oh, dude! I like, don't! Don't! Yes, seriously, I want you guys to hang out with each other. That's why it's called an alliance.32600:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.260brian camastral: That's why.32700:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.800The Alliance: My and and you gotta so so let me let me explain. You'll get this immediately.32800:50:11.630 --> 00:50:13.779The Alliance: I'm not a player's coach.32900:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.999The Alliance: I'm never going to be a players coach. I'll be your friend.33000:50:18.140 --> 00:50:39.370The Alliance: But when it comes to how I'm gonna coach people I'm I'm I'm I'm like Mike Tomlin, like I'm just gonna tell you how to do it. And we're gonna like redo it. And there's like lines. I like to draw around that. So I need you guys to do this, I want you guys to hang out without me. The more you hang out without me the better this works for everybody.33100:50:39.580 --> 00:50:44.590brian camastral: Well, that that's what the conclusion is. 6 of us came to. So we've already started33200:50:44.710 --> 00:50:50.849brian camastral: planning conversations, and this would be the 1st opportunity. So that's why I asked, because I.33300:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.130The Alliance: Yeah, no, I like I33400:50:53.590 --> 00:50:56.406The Alliance: totally do it. And33500:50:58.490 --> 00:51:04.618The Alliance: you know, I might like Ryan might stay up a day with you kind of thing, and I might zip out33600:51:05.280 --> 00:51:16.240The Alliance: or chase perhaps if if Chase would love it, he would stay for sure. But if you want, and if you don't want.33700:51:16.290 --> 00:51:30.760The Alliance: you know, you tell me sort of thing on that one. But no, I like I appreciate you doing that? This was what I was like, I, this was the whole point I like, when people start, actually, you know, hanging out when I'm not around.33800:51:30.780 --> 00:51:57.369The Alliance: Okay. Now we've got. Now it's an alliance right like now, it makes sense to do like one of the reasons I couldn't do a yearly thing. I wouldn't go to a yearly thing is, it wasn't just enough that you guys were having phone conversations. I needed people hanging out. So when I found out like 4 people had gone down to Amity's ranch already. It was like, Oh, that was the sign. That was what I was waiting for. I was like, I'm not gonna try to even talk into this until I like.33900:51:57.370 --> 00:52:02.009The Alliance: because I've got a selection process on the front end. I built a high performing team in this group.34000:52:02.390 --> 00:52:07.919The Alliance: and there are still gaps in people they're not like. That's why I want a bigger group. There's like, I'm34100:52:08.040 --> 00:52:29.920The Alliance: trying to put people from different industries and verticals and mindsets, and whatever together, in an interesting way. We're not going to get it right. But I think there's a super cool innovation accelerator, like thing that gets built this way. And you heard Andy Wall, like Andy Walsh I've known for fucking ever right. And Andy's like the unspoken thing, and everything he says is34200:52:29.920 --> 00:52:47.569The Alliance: dude. I'm the king of the selection process like I govern the most elite teams in the universe. This Navy seals and red bulls at like the selection process is the most refined, brutal thing you've ever fucking seen, ever, ever. So that's how he gets to his team. So I'm like, Okay, how do you do that for creative leaders without all the34300:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.370The Alliance: boot camp? Right? Like.34400:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.419The Alliance: that's sort of what I'm trying. I'm aiming at a little bit, because I think it'll be the.34500:52:54.710 --> 00:52:55.330brian camastral: Yeah.34600:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.729The Alliance: So here, I mean.34700:52:57.280 --> 00:53:04.160The Alliance: I I can give. I can give you one more thing in a minute, just because I think this will help. You understand, when I think about the alliance.34800:53:05.190 --> 00:53:31.139The Alliance: I have had the great lucky fortune, or maybe precision, living to be at the in in the city and at the front end of 7 different big cultural uprisings. I was in Santa Fe for the start of the New Age. I was in Seattle, the birth of grunge. I was in San Francisco for the birth of the Internet, and I, you know, on and on. And I got to participate in 7 of these at the cutting edge.34900:53:31.380 --> 00:53:38.690The Alliance: The industrial music movement that came out of you know the Midwest, another one in each case35000:53:39.650 --> 00:53:45.859The Alliance: to be totally honest. At the center of that were 100 people. It's a hundred people35100:53:46.310 --> 00:54:07.480The Alliance: driving each of those movements forward. That's what it took to change culture at scale. It took a hundred creatives sort of simultaneously working in lockstep, not towards the same goal, but with a collective ambition. Right? This is where we're moving things towards. This is what we see that you don't. We want this? We're going to do this.35200:54:07.480 --> 00:54:34.729The Alliance: you know all the stuff, even like I've been parts of like really crazy secret discussions, for, like gay rights, it was my friends who put Will and Grace on television intentionally, because they wanted to put gay people in your living room because Cosby normalized black people and racism. It helped until Cosby went crazy. There were efforts over long periods of time by very like committed people at the center of things, and I saw it again and again and again.35300:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.760The Alliance: And with the alliance35400:54:38.460 --> 00:54:49.059The Alliance: I don't know how I'm gonna other than slowly, how I'm gonna convince people a hundred people is a good idea in the alliance because everybody wants a small, intimate group. But I'm trying to build an army of creatives.35500:54:50.850 --> 00:55:04.630brian camastral: Well, the thing I told you I want to do with coaching is only to get into motion again because I've become aware that isn't really what I want to do, and I don't want to get paid by the hour right, even if it's a project fee, there's no money in it.35600:55:05.256 --> 00:55:19.639brian camastral: So I need to design something different. That's like that's got real money. It's it's not all for the money. But I learned a long time ago that someone's gonna get the money, and if I'm doing the work, why not me or.35700:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.450The Alliance: I'm with you.35800:55:20.450 --> 00:55:26.009brian camastral: You get part so. And I love this idea you gave me about fast performing teams.35900:55:26.270 --> 00:55:30.180brian camastral: What I've realized is my true love is leading36000:55:30.290 --> 00:55:34.619brian camastral: a group and building a team. So maybe there's a little36100:55:35.224 --> 00:55:50.995brian camastral: collective of independent people, or a hundred creatives, or whatever, and I don't need to be the anointed, you know, limelight person, but I have an ability that is unique in its own way. So maybe one of these36200:55:52.040 --> 00:56:09.739brian camastral: future cultural uprisings will fit my unique transformative capacity and my love and passion to make a difference. So I don't know that today. But I'm hoping by the end of the Alliance in September. I will have some direction around this.36300:56:09.910 --> 00:56:13.089brian camastral: It might be too fast, and I can go an inch a day.36400:56:13.090 --> 00:56:21.687The Alliance: Well, all I'm saying to you is, this is what I this is what I was trying to get, and then I gotta go because I gotta. I gotta talk to Courtney in 3Êmin. But36500:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.100The Alliance: I don't believe36600:56:24.360 --> 00:56:40.039The Alliance: this is why I wanted you to park purpose on the side. Same thing. I think you're not you especially knowing you. We everything we have to do has to be to ground you, to ground you, to ground you, to ground you to ground you right? So the way we're gonna ground this is to have you36700:56:40.530 --> 00:57:06.739The Alliance: test out little things in the world. Little right? You're testing out some coaching stuff. You know what I mean like, but have it pointed at. I'd like to learn these things. What you know what I mean. I built the a lot I built. You guys, I love, I love this. But I had 17 hypotheses or something. I can't. I'd have to go back to the original checklist. But I had a 17 hypotheses about what I thought I could do with this curriculum and the right people. Blah! Blah! All that stuff.36800:57:06.880 --> 00:57:21.069The Alliance: And like, I'm just testing hypotheses right now to see like I told you where the vision is, and I'm unattached to when we get there. If it even happens. I just think it's fucking fun. Because I'm like, Okay, I gotta build my own subculture36900:57:21.210 --> 00:57:38.569The Alliance: just cause we can. And I like, I I want to do with a bunch of really cool, creative people who I like hanging out with, because it'd be fun, cause I've seen this. There's nothing more fun than being part of a like a subculture shifting culture. It's a blast.37000:57:38.570 --> 00:57:39.080brian camastral: Okay.37100:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.320The Alliance: Yes, right bye.37200:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.400brian camastral: Thank you. I am.37300:57:42.400 --> 00:57:53.566The Alliance: Yeah, no, I mean, it's really I like, it's so fun. I've done it a bunch of times I've even and flow. I mean, I've single handedly done it at like a much different scale. But I like it's a fun game to play37400:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.512The Alliance: and it and it lasts in a really unusual way.37500:57:58.170 --> 00:58:11.649The Alliance: And it has to be humble because you can't shape. You can't do it yourself. I mean, I could. I did some stuff with flow, and maybe or you can do it yourself. But you need 25 years, 30 years. If you wanna do it fast, you gotta do it together. So like.37600:58:12.080 --> 00:58:12.500brian camastral: Yes.37700:58:12.500 --> 00:58:19.519The Alliance: You know. I like it. I think you should iterate a bunch. I really37800:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.750The Alliance: what I really want to see from you more than anything else37900:58:24.990 --> 00:58:34.279The Alliance: is, how do you lead high performing teams to impact environmental change38000:58:34.400 --> 00:58:43.559The Alliance: because there's no leadership in that like they did. They dude. You want to talk about a bunch of people who keep tripping over their dicks.38100:58:45.130 --> 00:58:57.510brian camastral: Well, this is my, this is the exact place I want to be. I've been banging my head against the wall for 20 years trying to find the language for it, or I'm not maybe not doing the right.38200:58:57.950 --> 00:58:59.249brian camastral: This certain level of.38300:58:59.686 --> 00:59:01.430The Alliance: So I I well.38400:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.179brian camastral: Anyway. Let's go.38500:59:04.180 --> 00:59:08.390The Alliance: Yeah, so do me a favor. It would you iterate, spin up38600:59:08.970 --> 00:59:33.959The Alliance: what would look like a product for you, building a high performing team in the environmental innovation space. I have to the 2 people I started equilibrium with, she's a billionaire and he, he's they've got 60 cutting edge companies in their incubator right now that they built. And they're all so like, that's interesting. Put together, like, I just want you to have something. So I put you on the phone with somebody38700:59:34.060 --> 00:59:39.980The Alliance: you could have something to talk about. It'll take a little while, and I gotta go talk to Courtney, so I gotta go.38800:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.080brian camastral: Take care, Stephen bye.
