WEBVTT100:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.960The Alliance: Hello!200:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.469The Alliance: No! You're muted.300:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.200Amity Cooper: Hi.400:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.130The Alliance: Bye, how are you.500:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.519Amity Cooper: I'm good. How about you?600:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.860The Alliance: Good. Thank you.700:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.929The Alliance: Let us jump in, Emily. Number 2.800:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.879The Alliance: Alright! What surprised you this month? What was fun? What was interesting.900:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.099Amity Cooper: Well, I think breaking down. How1000:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.039Amity Cooper: did you just ask me what was interesting about your last? Our last meeting.1100:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.679The Alliance: This month for you. What have you learned? What have you been.1200:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.210Amity Cooper: Wow!1300:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.280The Alliance: Yeah, yeah.1400:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.009Amity Cooper: So I.1500:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.849The Alliance: This is about you, Amity. I know this is a weird concept for you. We're actually focused on you, not on the other people in your life. It's actually about you.1600:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.850Amity Cooper: I1700:02:25.040 --> 00:02:38.729Amity Cooper: fair? Okay, yeah, I get it. I get it. And I'm just, I'm I'm just telling you like, it has been really helpful. Because when you started to break down all of your.1800:02:40.470 --> 00:02:52.600Amity Cooper: the, the checklist, the test, the honey, do list like, do this. Do this, do this. Do this. I really needed to hear that, because I can get very lost in1900:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.370Amity Cooper: the big picture. And then I feel frazzled on2000:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.020Amity Cooper: the minutia right like. So I spent a lot of time2100:03:05.460 --> 00:03:28.240Amity Cooper: digging in and just getting into that headspace where I could just make my lists organize it, talking to chat, Gpt, my favorite friend Kevin, and like just like doing it like setting, setting order up. And it feels really really good. I have to say.2200:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.149The Alliance: This so great.2300:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.010Amity Cooper: Yeah.2400:03:35.460 --> 00:03:45.080Amity Cooper: And you have been in my head for like weeks, because I have been listening to2500:03:45.440 --> 00:04:12.300Amity Cooper: the art of the impossible. I was doing that while I was like reading it. So when we 1st started like, that's, I was just putting that on audible. Then I finished that again, and then I then I jumped to the rise of Superman, so I had never listened to that before. No, no! Then I went to the Furry Prayer Book, and I listened to that, and2600:04:13.670 --> 00:04:33.660Amity Cooper: it was so touching. Oh, my gosh! And hilarious! So much in that to just reflect on! And then I went to the rise of Superman. So now you're still like in my head, and I'm listening to stealing fire. And I have things to say about that book2700:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.710Amity Cooper: so like.2800:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.596Amity Cooper: It is powerful stuff that you unpacked there.2900:04:49.520 --> 00:05:14.749Amity Cooper: so I don't know. I just been like, I've been listening to you for weeks now. So it's been really helpful, because every time there's something that you, you come back around to that circle of of, like you close that circle for me about just the process of flow. And how do you get there? Where do you do? What are the steps? Because I can get there really easily3000:05:14.940 --> 00:05:31.840Amity Cooper: for for different various reasons. But it's about applying that to how I want to come out of the State. And how do I get? How do I get the vision? How do I put the vision in motion? And that has been super super helpful?3100:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.650Amity Cooper: So, thanks.3200:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.590The Alliance: You're welcome. It did the feedback. The addition of the feedback exercise?3300:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.859The Alliance: Which of the triggers has been working the best for you3400:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.480The Alliance: of the 4 we're focusing on, or if you freestyle them to your own.3500:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.250Amity Cooper: Have totally freestyled it, because drying is not my cup of tea, it never has been3600:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.200Amity Cooper: so I do a lot of3700:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.890Amity Cooper: deep meditation. I'm a reiki practitioner.3800:06:09.500 --> 00:06:18.409Amity Cooper: And so so things like that so feedback of like I've been working out every day.3900:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.850The Alliance: No, I mean, we gave you a shit list exercise to start doing4000:06:23.060 --> 00:06:31.560The Alliance: right. That was this. Once exercise was to start working on your shit list. We did a little. Yeah, the shit to do when things go wrong.4100:06:32.076 --> 00:06:34.140Amity Cooper: What list is that.4200:06:34.140 --> 00:06:41.750The Alliance: Well, that was the assignment for this month. Right? We we work together on it in class. We built that shit to do when shit goes wrong list.4300:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.900Amity Cooper: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.4400:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.280The Alliance: Right? Yeah, after that. Right? So that, how's that been going.4500:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.913Amity Cooper: Really good like, I said,4600:06:49.810 --> 00:07:02.290Amity Cooper: actually, just just over the weekend, I really started composing and putting down, like the non-negotiables, all the filters all the things that4700:07:03.055 --> 00:07:11.709Amity Cooper: I need to owning myself. And also just saying, Okay, this is this has to happen. These sorts of4800:07:11.800 --> 00:07:36.380Amity Cooper: the container needs to have these certain a mix in order for me to move forward. And so I started making my 100 steps list. And that is what has been that has been hard to organize, because it's it is the shit list, like everything's on it. And then so what I've done is like, I've written 50 things out, and then I4900:07:36.680 --> 00:07:49.030Amity Cooper: and then I went back into Chat, Gpt to help me organize it, and so that that, like I said, like it is, that's the thing that has been feels really satisfying because.5000:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.640The Alliance: That's where and that's about where we are. We're on the we're working right to 100.5100:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.319The Alliance: that's dope. Have you been? What's your daily progress like on your clear goals?5200:08:04.974 --> 00:08:08.429Amity Cooper: Well, I think pretty.5300:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.979Amity Cooper: So. The clear goals, what I basically came down to is5400:08:15.210 --> 00:08:22.740Amity Cooper: based on the 3 prong mission that I have, which is 1st and foremost, I have to get up the ranch and5500:08:22.940 --> 00:08:36.900Amity Cooper: bring in revenue. And so that has been, those are my daily tasks, and that has been intense, and then because that is so demanding and necessary right? And then the other. The other5600:08:37.250 --> 00:08:51.360Amity Cooper: short term Vision Mission is to get my book out, and I have 5 chapters written. I have all of these things sort of in alignment. I've been getting some help with that of organizing myself.5700:08:51.490 --> 00:09:02.230Amity Cooper: And then the long term Vision Mission is to get that e-learning platform up and going, and I've had to put that off to the side because I just can't. I can't5800:09:02.760 --> 00:09:18.940Amity Cooper: do it all at once. So getting up earlier like. So I guess all of the daily tasks is just I got. I have shit to do and get it done, and feed horses and find money and all those kinds of things. So5900:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.400Amity Cooper: that's what that's my daily list.6000:09:22.870 --> 00:09:34.300The Alliance: But you. And has it been, did you using a clear goals list working with the challenge skills balance working with complete concentration things working with immediate feedback? Has it increased flow6100:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.620The Alliance: for you? Have you seen, have you noticed that.6200:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.480Amity Cooper: No, that has not increased flow for me. What is increased flow for me is when I6300:09:44.630 --> 00:09:49.489Amity Cooper: do my meditation practice, and I I have6400:09:49.950 --> 00:10:05.299Amity Cooper: I have guardrails that keep my sanity in place, and so when I so my family is gone, I've been alone in my house, for, like they've been gone to Europe for 2 weeks, and so they're coming back. And on the 16, th6500:10:05.470 --> 00:10:13.050Amity Cooper: and the fact that they have not been here has been huge for me because I can have.6600:10:13.530 --> 00:10:25.310Amity Cooper: I've created the the environment so that I can just do me without having to deal with everybody else. And so that that has been huge for me.6700:10:26.342 --> 00:10:30.280Amity Cooper: The tasks that I have been doing6800:10:30.460 --> 00:10:37.670Amity Cooper: and are required of me are not flow generating tasks. They're the mucking6900:10:37.940 --> 00:10:55.109Amity Cooper: tasks like the shit that needs to get moved around the money that needs to be found, the management of people. And that's not flow activating, for sure, because I really thrive in more autonomy and solo work.7000:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.459Amity Cooper: So. But it's what I have.7100:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.750The Alliance: Do for now.7200:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.650Amity Cooper: Yeah.7300:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.700The Alliance: Pump.7400:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.770The Alliance: So I think, by the way, it's a fairly big victory7500:11:08.070 --> 00:11:20.480The Alliance: that you figured out where to put your focus and what to park for a little while. I didn't want to pass that over like the 1st time we talked. You had no idea which way 1st what to order and how to focus on that.7600:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.980Amity Cooper: Yeah.7700:11:21.150 --> 00:11:36.814The Alliance: Right. So that's like it's a big deal to come up with. Oh, okay, I'm gonna get the ranch stable. I'm gonna finish the book. And then I'm gonna focus on the course. Even that is is actually a big deal. Because it's got to provide a little bit of re relief.7800:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.100Amity Cooper: Yeah, it does. Thank you for recognizing that.7900:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.419The Alliance: Yeah, for sure.8000:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.040Amity Cooper: What?8100:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.999The Alliance: What can, what can we focus on today that that you need help with.8200:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.266Amity Cooper: I think8300:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.560Amity Cooper: Maybe8400:11:59.170 --> 00:12:10.512Amity Cooper: I don't know what you can do for ranch operations, or whatever I don't think, you know, like you 1st said to me, I can't help you. With that I got my own shit. I got my own acreage. I got to deal with8500:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.790Amity Cooper: but maybe maybe talking a little bit more about the book process.8600:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.480Amity Cooper: So what?8700:12:19.680 --> 00:12:31.160Amity Cooper: And I and I have to be honest like, I haven't done my 100 step list for the book yet, because I've been just so focused on the immediate issue of8800:12:31.820 --> 00:12:40.940Amity Cooper: property, maintenance, and management. But I've been. I have an assistant, and I've been working with her for a number of years, and8900:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.989Amity Cooper: I think, the biggest.9000:12:45.210 --> 00:12:59.169Amity Cooper: My biggest gap is where I I have this book outline. I actually, I actually have a draft. I have all my chapters laid out. I have everything. And when and Heidi.9100:12:59.340 --> 00:13:09.710Amity Cooper: months ago, when we had a conversation, she's like, all right. You want to put this. You want to trans transfer this all into notebook Llm.9200:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.560Amity Cooper: And then and I have9300:13:13.000 --> 00:13:30.349Amity Cooper: a massive amount of content that I have written or spoken about, like I have so much stuff out there that I had my assistant go through and go through all my interviews, all of my newsletters all of that stuff9400:13:30.510 --> 00:13:37.369Amity Cooper: and transcribe it so that it could be merged with the outline so that I could find9500:13:37.500 --> 00:13:48.679Amity Cooper: the topics, the talk, the research, the data whatever, so that I could integrate it into the book, so that each and essentially each chapter could be9600:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.770Amity Cooper: roughed in9700:13:50.990 --> 00:14:07.100Amity Cooper: with the use of all of that extra support. So right now she we've put together. We compiled the 1st 5 chapters. Now. Granted they're not. This is where I come in, and this is where I edit, and I put my9800:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.439Amity Cooper: special sauce to it. But like.9900:14:11.020 --> 00:14:19.739Amity Cooper: have you ever done any of that before when writing your books is that it related or used in your process? How do you? How do you go about that.10000:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.259The Alliance: Oh, no! And I would so I would never do that.10100:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.250Amity Cooper: And.10200:14:26.250 --> 00:14:36.510The Alliance: The reason is, I have found that when you try to get old, what I have found is that when you try to import old stuff into new stuff.10300:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.199The Alliance: Save yourself. Time is what everybody wants to do.10400:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.439The Alliance: In my experience the old stuff is so10500:14:45.620 --> 00:14:58.610The Alliance: voice different, everything. The style is so all. There's too many styles, too many voices, and I find it impossible. I don't think it's worth it. I think you can get10600:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.470The Alliance: through a book.10700:15:02.072 --> 00:15:09.080The Alliance: You know a page a day for 200 days is not a tremendous amount of time.10800:15:09.420 --> 00:15:32.299The Alliance: and I think, trying to take all the other stuff and get it together actually takes more time. You think it. In my experience I think it's going to take less. This is why. So when I keep a slush pile right? I edit stuff out of the book. I never go back and look what's even if I have to rewrite the same thing. I very rarely unless I'm like oh, I wrote it better last time. Then I may go look.10900:15:32.760 --> 00:15:50.634The Alliance: but even then I'm careful, because I just for me, I'm not saying for you. I'm saying for me. I don't like that process because I find it actually steals time and doesn't doesn't make time. But what I think that process is useful for, and what's worth the damn here, because the the work is done, and I think that's kind of cool is11000:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.030The Alliance: you have all your data, you have all your research and all the science, though11100:15:57.120 --> 00:16:15.550The Alliance: once you've got your chapters organized asking Chatgbt, what are the what are the facts I need to cover in each chapter like the science facts. Right? That would be very like, that's an outline thing that could. That that strikes me as very useful, and I'll do that sometimes.11200:16:15.884 --> 00:16:30.279The Alliance: Usually I know what I want in a chapter, but sometimes I don't, but that makes sense to me the style itself. I find it too hard to cobble that stuff together. Now you may be different for me, but that's my experience.11300:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.620Amity Cooper: Hmm, that's interesting.11400:16:33.100 --> 00:16:40.059Amity Cooper: Yeah. And I think and like, I said, you know, in full transparency, I haven't11500:16:40.180 --> 00:16:48.700Amity Cooper: had the bandwidth. I I just put it in Kate's hands, and I'm letting her do all the busy11600:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.869Amity Cooper: tech stuff, and and then once she gets it to me.11700:16:54.080 --> 00:17:03.529Amity Cooper: I'll be able to like, map out my like the list of how I'm gonna do this and and what my goal is because I want it done by September that.11800:17:03.530 --> 00:17:09.339The Alliance: The only thing the only thing I would tell you enlisting to you is11900:17:10.079 --> 00:17:16.819The Alliance: especially if you have. If you're if you're blowing off the drawing exercises. Are you doing the steal? A style exercises this month.12000:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.060The Alliance: or you're too busy.12100:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.489Amity Cooper: That's I haven't looked at that yet. But yeah, that's the plan.12200:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.436The Alliance: Okay, the12300:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.996The Alliance: Well, you're supposed to be doing it12400:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.509The Alliance: 3 times a week between tasks.12500:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.223The Alliance: Oh,12600:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.810The Alliance: You know what I mean. Like it's, it's it's your class you get to. You. Get to do what you want.12700:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.549Amity Cooper: I know, I know.12800:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.340The Alliance: I'm not. Gonna I'm not gonna tell anybody.12900:17:37.340 --> 00:17:44.550Amity Cooper: Line is not just, Steven. The drawing is not for me, but what I did is I.13000:17:44.820 --> 00:18:09.650The Alliance: Might not be for you. But getting outside your normal perspective and seeing things from a different angle is definitely for you is the stuff that I've helped you with has been about that, and that's what that drawing exercise is about. So I get. The drawing is not for you, but it's not a drawing exercise in the perspective exercise which we've already talked about being beneficial. That's it's entirely up to you. What all what I wanted to say is13100:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.410The Alliance: enlisting to you13200:18:13.060 --> 00:18:23.289The Alliance: the thing that I think we want to focus on, especially because your day doesn't sound flowy. And it sounds like it's gonna get a little complicated, because your family's coming home in a couple of days13300:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.890The Alliance: I would find a way to carve out13400:18:27.180 --> 00:18:41.160The Alliance: 20Êmin to half an hour every day to advance every one of your 100 personally, like just literally get in the habit of making daily progress on both the book and the that list of 100, even if it's 5Êmin a day.13500:18:41.490 --> 00:18:51.939The Alliance: Just so you can have that forward momentum because it's really hard to go from not moving at all into moment. It's easier to lengthen it out so. And it's also.13600:18:52.280 --> 00:19:18.919The Alliance: if you're not feeding your dreams on a sort of a daily basis, life burnout happens really quickly and meaning drains away. Which I know has been an issue for you. So I would try to insert little like, Okay, I'm doing all this stuff, and I get like you know what I mean. I was. I've been in business building mode for the past year, and it left me like, you know, 2Êh windows in the morning, where I would work on my books, and then I build businesses for the.13700:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.600Amity Cooper: Yeah.13800:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.560The Alliance: 12Êh.13900:19:20.560 --> 00:19:28.229Amity Cooper: Actually, when you say that that is exactly what I'm trying to do. Like, I I wake up at 5,14000:19:28.280 --> 00:19:55.450Amity Cooper: and that's an extra like I naturally wake up at 6. So I'm just pushing it back. So I get up at 5, and I'm in bed by 9 like that is, and in getting those that extra hour, whether it's the 5 Am. Club or however you want to look at it. That extra hour is golden for me, and I can be with myself and with my thoughts and with my dreams14100:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.699Amity Cooper: where I don't, I'm unencumbered by everything else that's needed. Right? I mean, that's how you do it.14200:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.320The Alliance: Yep.14300:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.640The Alliance: and if you can get into a little flow, just a little bit of micro flow in that 1st hour.14400:20:08.860 --> 00:20:20.410The Alliance: it sort of balances whatever shit life throws at you for the next. I mean, I mean, barring big crises right like barring the big crisis, it'll balance out most of a crap day or complicated day.14500:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.329Amity Cooper: Yeah, all right. Can I tell you something?14600:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.340The Alliance: Yeah.14700:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.290Amity Cooper: I.14800:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.250Amity Cooper: So I'm in the stealing fire book.14900:20:33.450 --> 00:20:45.529Amity Cooper: and it's something I wanted to tell you it about in Truckee, but it just didn't feel like an appropriate time, or whatever, but it was really meaningful for me.15000:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.516Amity Cooper: Back in15100:20:49.940 --> 00:20:55.349Amity Cooper: I think it was like 2,013, 2,014. I took a trip to Peru.15200:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.289Amity Cooper: and I was with.15300:20:59.170 --> 00:21:07.900Amity Cooper: We were camping and traveling with some shamans up into the Andes. The Cuero Shamans and I had a Kundalini awakening.15400:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.279Amity Cooper: I had a15500:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.679Amity Cooper: my entire world shifted, and I15600:21:18.360 --> 00:21:28.000Amity Cooper: had an ecstatic experience, and it took me 2 years from that trip15700:21:28.770 --> 00:21:35.960Amity Cooper: to integrate what had happened to me. I think my husband thought I was. I had a psychotic break15800:21:36.320 --> 00:21:44.850Amity Cooper: like I was, and I can a channel.15900:21:45.190 --> 00:21:52.760Amity Cooper: I speak in tongues. I do. I have these incredible mystical16000:21:53.030 --> 00:22:10.569Amity Cooper: experiences, and I can get there really fast, and is kind of insane that your book actually puts language16100:22:11.250 --> 00:22:18.420Amity Cooper: to that experience, because my community in general, like where I was going for help and guidance.16200:22:19.760 --> 00:22:26.820Amity Cooper: they just, you know, they were limited on what they had. But now the science sort of like matches and shows16300:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.010Amity Cooper: oh, that I'm not in, you know.16400:22:32.140 --> 00:22:44.039Amity Cooper: I may be gifted on a certain level, but like it's not outside the norm, and I think it was. It was really really powerful to hear that and and read that in your book.16500:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.330Amity Cooper: so.16600:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.779The Alliance: I'm glad that was useful.16700:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.510Amity Cooper: Yeah.16800:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.585Amity Cooper: And16900:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.670Amity Cooper: yeah. So I I17000:22:54.970 --> 00:23:01.509Amity Cooper: when you. So the thing for me, when like, when you asked like, how I get into flow17100:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.259Amity Cooper: it just. It's like a switch for me.17200:23:06.640 --> 00:23:30.630Amity Cooper: like the veil has been pure so much that I can. I can feel I can feel the energy sort of like this, that well, what they would call like a serpent energy rising. And I can feel it. And then there's some sort of like a dissonance like there's a separation between my physical body. And then this17300:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.570Amity Cooper: other17400:23:33.090 --> 00:23:43.299Amity Cooper: sense of self like like you've described. But like it, it does exist like that for me, and it can happen really, really fast. And I don't need a lot of17500:23:43.980 --> 00:23:49.590Amity Cooper: cues to make that happen. And I've worked on that for a very long time. So17600:23:50.093 --> 00:24:00.190Amity Cooper: that's why I have to do the kind of meditate I'm not doing your Yoga meditation, but I'm doing a different kind of meditation that helps me.17700:24:00.310 --> 00:24:07.060Amity Cooper: I'm just doing my thing, just getting me to where I need to be to be in that space and17800:24:07.230 --> 00:24:12.579Amity Cooper: place of that liminal space. It really helps me to do that.17900:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.400Amity Cooper: So I just wanted to share.18000:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.489The Alliance: It's interesting.18100:24:19.500 --> 00:24:27.689The Alliance: Does it provide any benefit beyond the visuals and the feelings.18200:24:30.810 --> 00:24:39.200Amity Cooper: Yes, it does. There's a sense of inner knowing and trust that the intuition that I have18300:24:39.440 --> 00:24:49.420Amity Cooper: the creative pulse pulses that I have are real and validated like there is, I never doubt.18400:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.089Amity Cooper: I never doubt myself.18500:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.030The Alliance: That's interesting. So you get confidence.18600:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.690The Alliance: Bool, that's cool.18700:25:05.530 --> 00:25:05.860Amity Cooper: Yeah.18800:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.930The Alliance: That's interesting.18900:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.699The Alliance: Okay, we got 5Êmin.19000:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.300The Alliance: What do you want to do? What are we solving.19100:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.319Amity Cooper: well, I guess I would just I would put it back on19200:25:20.930 --> 00:25:33.540Amity Cooper: if in some ways this feels really extreme for me, because I have a sort of inner knowing and inner confidence of19300:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.650Amity Cooper: a long. I can play the long game like I'm going in and19400:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.590Amity Cooper: Things are lined up for me. I feel that in myself.19500:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.169Amity Cooper: and yet on the day to day19600:25:49.420 --> 00:25:56.629Amity Cooper: structure of things, I look like a fucking hot mess, and it just19700:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.170Amity Cooper: I wish there was more. I had more19800:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.830Amity Cooper: something, some sort of bridge between.19900:26:09.610 --> 00:26:23.280Amity Cooper: And and maybe I'm answering my what I'm putting out there. It's like more rhetorical. It's just like, I think, that the list and the way you're setting things up, and the way you've organized and constructed your20000:26:23.430 --> 00:26:31.330Amity Cooper: vision, and how you're giving us this formula for it, like I think that is my way forward, because20100:26:33.260 --> 00:26:41.909Amity Cooper: I don't have to worry that I I don't have. I'm not worrying about like how the outcome's gonna be. It's the process. That's my challenge.20200:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.010The Alliance: It. I mean it.20300:26:48.490 --> 00:26:54.869The Alliance: So writing up a clear goals list and adhering to it, the night before20400:26:55.390 --> 00:27:04.579The Alliance: will pretty quickly start to erode that hot mess feeling. I'm not saying the day isn't gonna still. Be that20500:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.710The Alliance: cuckoo sometimes, but20600:27:07.890 --> 00:27:14.800The Alliance: when you're matching the structure that you're you're preparing for yourself, and you're making sure that that structure includes.20700:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.619The Alliance: you know, amity time. Here's my, you know. Here's where I'm gonna work on the 100 steps. Do.20800:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.639The Alliance: here. Here's where I'm gonna work on the book for a little bit.20900:27:24.980 --> 00:27:41.739The Alliance: I think you're gonna start to get a little more control. So if I would like to lean into one thing heavily. It'd be making that list. And also, if you haven't run the experiment and counted how many things you can be excellent at in a day. I would look at that.21000:27:41.770 --> 00:28:06.490The Alliance: Because if you're a hot mess, it means that you're that you're overtaxed a lot of days also. Right? You know what I mean like. So I would really run that experiment and lean in and really start once you figure out, I have to run it for 2 weeks. Once you figure out, you know how many things you can be excellent at a day, really start aiming for that, and really lean into the clear goals thing. I think because I'm listening to you.21100:28:06.570 --> 00:28:18.013The Alliance: and it sounds you have confidence in your long term vision. You've got some order to it now, which you didn't have when you started. Those things are. Those are sort of awesome.21200:28:18.640 --> 00:28:37.809The Alliance: And now we've given you the tools to break it down. So it's really about sort of like just typing this a little bit and getting a little more control over your day. And I give you like. I know what you're up against a little bit and there's only gonna be so much control that you're gonna get over your days for a little while. But the last thing I wanna ask you before we jump is21300:28:38.670 --> 00:29:01.609The Alliance: you said 2 things that strike me as contradictory, and I want to understand them before we go. So one is, you thrive best when you're autonomous and you're alone, and you're pushing it forward. And yet you've built a business recently around the horses that require you to be way outside your sweet spot. How do you? How's that gonna work.21400:29:03.120 --> 00:29:11.809Amity Cooper: Well, I'm an ambivert like I balance. I I titrate between being an extrovert and an introvert and21500:29:12.538 --> 00:29:24.109Amity Cooper: I can be on and push forward and be social, and I have certain I have assigned myself. I'm I'm the boss, right? So I've assigned myself.21600:29:24.690 --> 00:29:30.149Amity Cooper: There are certain things that sweet spot where I perform really really well, and then I21700:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.500Amity Cooper: pass off all the other things that are not, and.21800:29:34.970 --> 00:29:46.529The Alliance: That's what I was checking on. That's what I wanted to make sure. That's where I was going. Okay, good, excellent. So that's it was just contradictory, and I was like, wait a minute. If she doesn't start outsourcing the shit you're just gonna get buried by. But you're ready.21900:29:46.530 --> 00:29:57.852Amity Cooper: So I just asked 1st to a person that is that I thought was a partner, and that is not a partner, so I don't know if you knew that or not. So I I had to.22000:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.480Amity Cooper: renegotiate.22100:30:00.930 --> 00:30:07.180Amity Cooper: These last 2 weeks have been like renegotiating my partnership agreement, and22200:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.410Amity Cooper: she finally came back, and she's like, I don't have the money, and I gotta do you know me?22300:30:14.580 --> 00:30:21.820Amity Cooper: And so now I know. And now I'll go find the money, and I'll go do something else. But22400:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.859Amity Cooper: she's now my employee.22500:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.650Amity Cooper: So that's fun. But yeah, so22600:30:30.800 --> 00:30:44.650Amity Cooper: that's where I feel like I'm a hot mess and I want to have. I'm having a fucking breakdown like every other day. But other than that, I'm good figure. I'll figure this shit out22700:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.170Amity Cooper: alright.22800:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.030The Alliance: Cool, are you?22900:30:53.770 --> 00:31:10.719The Alliance: if you if you could make it this Thursday Annie is pretty amazing. She's a really interesting woman to listen to. She's really I don't know anybody thinks like her. Sark is the same way, but they're they're they're totally different. It's really fun to listen listen to her, Ella, and are you coming to San Francisco?23000:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.510Amity Cooper: I am. I'm coming in on the 17.th23100:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.640The Alliance: Yeah, so am I.23200:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.949Amity Cooper: Okay, they don't.23300:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.009Amity Cooper: I'm I'm staying at the Zephyr.23400:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.130The Alliance: I think that's where we're standing.23500:31:22.524 --> 00:31:36.439The Alliance: As well. I'm not. I'm not Ryan Ryan or Andrew, but I think that's the one with the nice gym, which I think is the reason we chose it like, when they were doing I was, Yeah, I was like, I was like at least find something with a gym, so we we can have a.23600:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.830Amity Cooper: Well, yeah.23700:31:41.980 --> 00:31:49.456The Alliance: That should be fun. I have no idea what to expect. But I gotta write my speech.23800:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.979Amity Cooper: Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! I know you!23900:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.360The Alliance: To do.24000:31:52.360 --> 00:32:01.559Amity Cooper: I just have a I am going to go on the 18.th I'm going to go to some other talks, or whatever are you friendly with Daniel Kraft?24100:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.629The Alliance: Yeah, I've known Dan forever. I didn't know he was speaking in Nicole's thing. I would have been fun to see Dan.24200:32:07.020 --> 00:32:17.769Amity Cooper: In the morning on the 18th your day and do you know, Thomas Incel, i. Ein einsel INSE o.24300:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.909The Alliance: That name sounds familiar, but I don't know who. Just what does he do.24400:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.540Amity Cooper: He started a mental health24500:32:24.160 --> 00:32:30.359Amity Cooper: consortium of sorts. I forget. But like I've been following him. Well.24600:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.469The Alliance: I don't think I know him.24700:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.069Amity Cooper: Them. I'd love an introduction to Dan Kraft if you would.24800:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.599The Alliance: And give you an introduction to Dan Kraft. But he's a hot man24900:32:42.150 --> 00:32:54.710The Alliance: like I loved it. I love Dan. I've never seen anybody who can't follow up on any like he's like. You don't like. You think that Dan's not a solution. I mean, he's he's a solution.25000:32:55.410 --> 00:33:14.040The Alliance: maybe do a quick answer to quick question, like, you have very specific questions you can ask him at the time, but I have never, I mean, literally like I can't even speak at his God goddamn Conference, because you can't get his shit together to keep the day right. He keeps changing the like. It's like I love dad. I've known him for fucking ever, but25100:33:14.460 --> 00:33:38.149The Alliance: I like. I have tried to work with the dude 5 or 6 times in different capacities, and it's never happened because he can't get together, and his assistants, whoever he has working with him, are like is worse, like I. I'm not quite sure how how that all functions. I really like happy to give you the introduction, but like don't don't know eggs in that particular basket.25200:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.770Amity Cooper: Yeah.25300:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.202The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, there's25400:33:41.110 --> 00:33:47.950Amity Cooper: I find him hilarious, like I just the way he makes himself the human guinea pig, and he's trying out all this stuff and.25500:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.090The Alliance: I will tell you, by the way, for ranch fundraising.25600:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.240Amity Cooper: What's that?25700:33:52.240 --> 00:34:02.920The Alliance: Grant fundraising. The only suggestion I have before I jump is the easiest, easiest sort of25800:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.460The Alliance: way forward might be family offices.25900:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.130Amity Cooper: Yeah.26000:34:07.130 --> 00:34:33.920The Alliance: A lot of family offices are really poking at mental health. I was just the only reason I'm thinking about was just with a buddy of mine over the weekend. I don't know him well enough like Buddy acquaintance, but I've known him a long time, and I was like, What are you doing? I was like, I'm running a Giant Mental Health Family office for my family out of blah blah. And I was like, oh, that's interesting. That makes you know what I mean. And I were like 2 or 3 people who were sort of doing similar things in the world. I was in over the weekend. And I was like, Okay, so I've just, I just noticed that family offices now.26100:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.770Amity Cooper: Don't think care about.26200:34:34.770 --> 00:34:47.910The Alliance: Mental health. Yeah. So that's I mean, usually one of the easiest, because it's the. It's. It's only one conversation, whereas all the other ways to find money or a lot of conversations. You just have to find the right person to have the conversation with.26300:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.999Amity Cooper: All right. Can we talk about this in San Francisco a little bit more if you have time.26400:34:54.570 --> 00:35:01.239The Alliance: I I have no idea. We'll see in San Francisco, but we could talk about it a little bit more. Give me. I got. I got 5 more minutes. Go.26500:35:02.570 --> 00:35:08.549Amity Cooper: Oh, well, I just yeah, I was. I was thinking about private private funding.26600:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.070The Alliance: How much do you need.26700:35:13.640 --> 00:35:21.160Amity Cooper: Probably 750 to a million, I think, would tide me over until I start generating like, it's all pre-revenue. It's all.26800:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.092Amity Cooper: It's just money going down the mucking.26900:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.559The Alliance: You have a great business plan.27000:35:27.740 --> 00:35:36.511Amity Cooper: I think I do, and I can perfect it. I can totally perfect it. I I have a really interesting model and27100:35:37.790 --> 00:35:52.869Amity Cooper: but it's it's like, there's the the programs and the activities and the events and things like that that would be going on at the property. And then there's just the facility in general, which is just running a 40 acre, 80 acre property. And27200:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.789Amity Cooper: and I just need somebody who's the money bags, who can come in and and27300:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.619Amity Cooper: and support me that way. So I'm not constantly27400:36:04.440 --> 00:36:13.169Amity Cooper: challenged by where's the next? You know? How am I paying the mortgage like just somebody to who believes in the vision and27500:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.790Amity Cooper: wants to help it see it come to fruition.27600:36:18.156 --> 00:36:18.873Amity Cooper: So27700:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.109The Alliance: Okay. So I would tell you 2 things on that.27800:36:27.490 --> 00:36:31.219The Alliance: in my experience. Finding that kind of money27900:36:31.670 --> 00:36:40.340The Alliance: is hard. That's a lot of money. It's a big number and I would have 2 plans.28000:36:40.450 --> 00:36:59.692The Alliance: I would have a bootstrapping plan, and I would have a big vision plan, and I'd be working on them simultaneously. I really would. You. You need a bootstrapping plan. You need. You need a way for this thing to start to pay for itself as fast as possible. I'm not saying, you can't find the money. I think you probably can find the money.28100:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.609The Alliance: and but I don't think it's going to be fat28200:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.835The Alliance: unless you already have that rolodex and28300:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.590Amity Cooper: I have a pretty good wide network.28400:37:13.010 --> 00:37:18.995The Alliance: You have a good deck like you're gonna have like, that's a fundraising deck. Also, like28500:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.110The Alliance: your deck. Better be fucking phenomenal.28600:37:23.330 --> 00:37:27.999The Alliance: And you know really powerful and that like cause those are like28700:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.370The Alliance: most of what you're gonna get from people is28800:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.729The Alliance: oh, I don't know somebody, but if you send me a deck, I might be able to forward to my friend.28900:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.599The Alliance: So you gotta be ready for that.29000:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.299Amity Cooper: Yeah, I back to your idea of family offices. So29100:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.471Amity Cooper: we we're part of that family office network and29200:37:55.220 --> 00:38:06.040Amity Cooper: my husband, and I. And so we're in the tiger. 21 network like, I think that there's gonna be ways for me to29300:38:07.050 --> 00:38:14.768Amity Cooper: get exposure, that I wouldn't, you know, somebody else in my position might not have you know.29400:38:15.030 --> 00:38:26.950The Alliance: Okay. So I I believe all those things. But I'm telling you that if you're having conversations with me about I'm worried about money. You should be moving faster.29500:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.449Amity Cooper: Oh, fuck that. Okay, okay.29600:38:32.450 --> 00:38:57.079The Alliance: I mean, I don't mean to be. I don't right. You just should like if if this is stressing you out already, because I know what it's like to run an 80 acre property, and I know how often things go wrong. I mean, there hasn't been a year that I've owned my farms, and I have. I have 40 acres, and I used to have 5 that I haven't ended up losing 50 to $70,000 and just shit that goes wrong that needs to get fixed29700:38:57.577 --> 00:38:59.359The Alliance: and like, that's just country shit.29800:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.979The Alliance: Yeah, I know right?29900:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.600The Alliance: Fun, like I know, and it like.30000:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.090Amity Cooper: Every year.30100:39:03.090 --> 00:39:16.899The Alliance: What happens if you're like what the fuck? Yeah. So I mean, I get all the issues. I'm just like, okay, let's speed this up because I don't want you to lose your dream. That doesn't make any sense. I don't know how to speed it up for you, but.30200:39:16.900 --> 00:39:24.790Amity Cooper: It's gonna change. It's gonna change. So much for people. Yeah, okay, I hear you.30300:39:27.030 --> 00:39:31.349The Alliance: I'm eminently practical. I get scared over money stuff I'm like, well, okay.30400:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.390Amity Cooper: Well.30500:39:33.250 --> 00:39:42.320Amity Cooper: fuck, of course I need the fucking money like 6 months ago, and I was sort of tied up in30600:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.769Amity Cooper: the shenanigans of30700:39:45.060 --> 00:39:50.609Amity Cooper: picking the wrong partner, and I was like no to self. Don't do that again, you know.30800:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.632The Alliance: Note yourself, but you're out of it now, so30900:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.830Amity Cooper: I know.31000:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.330The Alliance: Right like that's great. That's progress. So like.31100:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.190The Alliance: get into high gear on that stuff a little bit.31200:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.140Amity Cooper: Okay.31300:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.730The Alliance: Seriously.31400:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.079The Alliance: You'll you'll tag me later, I think.31500:40:11.110 --> 00:40:11.960Amity Cooper: I know.31600:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.530The Alliance: Okay.31700:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.979Amity Cooper: All right.31800:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.249The Alliance: I will see you later this week, and I'll see you in San Francisco.31900:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.930Amity Cooper: Thanks, bye.32000:40:20.930 --> 00:40:21.490The Alliance: I.
