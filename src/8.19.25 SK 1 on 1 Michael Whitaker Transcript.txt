WEBVTT100:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.370The Alliance: What the heck?200:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.579The Alliance: Welcome back.300:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780The Alliance: We're having a crisis.400:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.180The Alliance: How are ya?500:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.389Michael Whitaker: Hey, doing pretty well, how you doing?600:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.830The Alliance: Good.700:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.000The Alliance: Out of any crisis.800:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.849Michael Whitaker: Yeah, everything okay?900:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.780The Alliance: It is totally fine. It is totally fine.1000:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.180The Alliance: my dog KO'd the, É Is Food Bowl?1100:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.139Michael Whitaker: Oh, yeah.1200:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.569The Alliance: Poured into the grate of the refrigerator.1300:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.550Michael Whitaker: Oh, jeez.1400:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.950The Alliance: Don't even ask. Yeah, justÉ I basically, I think I'm out a refrigerator.1500:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.029The Alliance: I gotta keep the dogs separate, because there's bound to be a fight, but É Hey, É1600:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.800The Alliance: So, how are you?1700:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.870Michael Whitaker: I'm doing well.1800:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.780The Alliance: Good. É Yeah.1900:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.340The Alliance: That was amazing the other day, right?2000:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.380Michael Whitaker: Yeah, just amazing.2100:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.790The Alliance: Amazing. Yeah, I thought so too. Alright, so, É2200:02:07.160 --> 00:02:22.169The Alliance: I want to, kick offÉ I want to turn to your hardest questions, but I haveÉ I have to mention something, and I can't tell if it is. Sometimes the AI summarizes things in a weird way for us, but the AI came back and was like, hey.2300:02:22.320 --> 00:02:39.200The Alliance: Michael wants more structure than the Alliance has. Is thatÉ and so I was like, is that true? Like, are youÉ are you craving structure that we don't have? And I was wondering about that, because that tends to be more, like, knowledge workers tend to crave structure.2400:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.550The Alliance: Creatives hate structure because they make so much structure for themselves.2500:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.470The Alliance: That anybody else's structure Feels like an imposition.2600:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.830Michael Whitaker: Yeah, I'm not sure what, É.2700:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.299The Alliance: I just was wondering if that was real, or likeÉ Yeah, I'm.2800:02:53.300 --> 00:03:05.340Michael Whitaker: the AI picked up on particularly. I didÉ I do think that there was some feedback I gave Ryan earlier in the year of things like, hey, if we're going into these experts coming in to talk.2900:03:05.440 --> 00:03:22.920Michael Whitaker: giving more in advance of, like, why? Like, what do we think their relation is to the overall objectives of the Alliance, so that we're coming in with, like, kind of that mindset and questioning? And that was more, like, the previous one with theÉ I'm forgetting their name, but the one that did the relationships side of things, É3000:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.970Michael Whitaker: it wasn't immediately obvious to me, like, okay, well, how does that connect in?3100:03:26.970 --> 00:03:38.599The Alliance: Yeah, I told you during the onboarding, but you're totally right, it's been, like, 3 months, or 2 months, right? And there's no way anybody's gonna remember that. That's a goodÉ actually, great note. Not me, not you, but great note.3200:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.809Michael Whitaker: So it's just, like, those kind of things, right? Like, and I totally get in, you know, ipsum fact, you know, post-session, I could be like, okay.3300:03:46.270 --> 00:04:05.620Michael Whitaker: people that are trying to achieve high, hard goals often will have challenges with relationships because they are maybe moving at a different pace, or shooting for things that their partners aren't shooting for, and that changes dynamics in the relationships, and so we think that in order to achieve high, hard goals, you need to have some of these skills on the managing the other relationships in your life. This is one of the world-leading experts in that.3400:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.790Michael Whitaker: we're bringing that forward to the conversation, right?3500:04:07.790 --> 00:04:17.709The Alliance: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I mostlyÉ I mean, literally, like, I didn'tÉ yours is way more eloquent than me, by the way. I, like, my thinking with Annie wasÉ3600:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.049The Alliance: Myself and everyÉ everyÉ almost every person, every creative, every entrepreneur loses a couple days a month to their emotions.3700:04:26.190 --> 00:04:38.339The Alliance: And often, it's family-related, right? Often it's your spouse. And that was the thinking, because I was like, I'm trying to save you guys some time, and if you can, like.3800:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.910The Alliance: mitigate one argument a month, you know what I mean? That's a big deal.3900:04:43.910 --> 00:05:00.010Michael Whitaker: Well, that makes sense, and it's just something that I don'tÉ like, I don't struggle with that. Like, I don't go very high or low on my emotions. I'm relatively stable, so the logical side for me is, oh, well, as you go into this more, you may create tensions.4000:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.340The Alliance: So that, that will back, yeah, that'llÉ.4100:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.720Michael Whitaker: aware of.4200:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.390Michael Whitaker: Yeah.4300:05:03.390 --> 00:05:21.639The Alliance: Yeah, that always happens, because there'sÉ there'sÉ I mean, I'm sure this is going on a little bit with yourÉ in your relationship right now, because you're going into a new thing. There's always, like, loss aversion. You know what I mean? Like, cognitive biases start rearing their head when you start fucking with somebody else's safety and security. It just happens, right?4400:05:21.640 --> 00:05:30.219Michael Whitaker: Well, and it's okay a little bit, because I, like, I haven't left the safety security of my job as I go into this thing, but there is this, like, how much do IÉ4500:05:30.320 --> 00:05:42.930Michael Whitaker: talk about it, bring it in, center everything, like, the things that I'm putting my mind into, how much do I pull that back into the other conversations, and, like, try to bring my wife and family along, versus let them keep4600:05:43.520 --> 00:06:01.299Michael Whitaker: kind of largely doing what they're doing, and keep them distinct, and that's theÉ that's more the balance for me, because I haven't left my job to pursue this, and I haven't, like, disrupted theÉ the core stability of the family, whichÉ which is a conscious choice. Like, IÉ with my kids going into high school and going into middle school.4700:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.069Michael Whitaker: having,4800:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.000The Alliance: Got it, yeah.4900:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.140Michael Whitaker: A relatively stable platform from which to explore these new areas is actually quite important to me.5000:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.820The Alliance: Well, it's, I meanÉ.5100:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.639Michael Whitaker: launching off into the ether.5200:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.470The Alliance: I have to tell you, Tim Ferriss and I agreed on this wholeheartedly, andÉ5300:06:16.540 --> 00:06:33.429The Alliance: So many people screw this up because they want to get there yesterday, and they wentÉ they end up someplace they don't want to be. But Tim Ferriss, when he wasÉ I think it was in the 4-Hour Work Week, I don't remember, maybe he just said it to me, but he stresses nights and weekends, right? Yeah. And I do too, and for me, like.5400:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.279The Alliance: I probably started working for magazines when I was 23.5500:06:40.030 --> 00:06:55.269The Alliance: I was still bartending at 28. That's when I quit. That's when I was like, okay, I can trust the journalism enough. Like, I started to realize I was everybody in my neighborhood's bank. Like, all my friends were coming to me for loads, and I was like.5600:06:55.270 --> 00:07:02.889The Alliance: oh, you're sta- like, if this is what's happening, you're, like, you're cool. You get, like, you can maybe stop bartending.5700:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.460Michael Whitaker: Yeah.5800:07:04.400 --> 00:07:15.300The Alliance: But, you know, I literally spent 5 years doing it before I launched that, and I never, not once, regretted that decision. Like, I'm soÉ I'm really happy I did that.5900:07:15.300 --> 00:07:24.689Michael Whitaker: Yeah, like, I'm in a veryÉ well, so I guess, finishing the further conÉ the original conversation, structure's the wrong word. Like, I'm not looking for structure. It's more likeÉ6000:07:24.690 --> 00:07:37.319Michael Whitaker: the links and just, like, the pulling pieces together, and even after the session, like, making sure we still have access to everything, because sometimes I like to post-process. Okay, I've now gone through the totality of it, now I can go back andÉ and reÉ.6100:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.989The Alliance: Yeah, you guys have the videos.6200:07:38.990 --> 00:07:50.209Michael Whitaker: Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, just making sure, and they are, just making sure that that's, like, even when we hit September, that there's still, like, a tail where we can still access it. It was that kind of feedback, more so thanÉ.6300:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.950The Alliance: Yeah, my plan. Yeah, my plan right now, with the stuff that we record.6400:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.540The Alliance: is to make a kind of alliance master library.6500:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.560The Alliance: Right, that's sort ofÉ that's myÉ that'sÉ I mean, that one is gonna go up on the podcast, so, like, that one.6600:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.350Michael Whitaker: Yeah, yeah.6700:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.509The Alliance: That is perpetual.6800:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.180The Alliance: Aw.6900:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.839The Alliance: What, what's on your mind today?7000:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.640The Alliance: Biggest challenge in front of you?7100:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.229Michael Whitaker: I don'tÉ you know, I don't know that there's, like, É7200:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.010Michael Whitaker: it's a huge challenge. I think I'mÉ so I'll share with you where I am, and we can kind.7300:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.839The Alliance: Yeah, tell me where you are.7400:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.470Michael Whitaker: soÉ7500:08:27.660 --> 00:08:44.009Michael Whitaker: you know, IÉ you know, I spent a good portion of July down in Costa Rica with the family, so that was, like, a good refreshÉ doing a lot of surfing, justÉ just getting out of the normal routine, and É which was great. You know, I still kind of kept enough of a touch on things to read and refresh and do a little bit of content, butÉ7600:08:44.130 --> 00:08:51.659Michael Whitaker: Did a little bit of the reset. You know, I would say what I'm trying to do, and having some success with, is just kind of like that7700:08:52.710 --> 00:09:02.029Michael Whitaker: slow, maybe not the right term, but kind of like a steady build, where I feel like I'm strengthening the platform from which I'm doing these things, so that I'm not just trying to, like.7800:09:02.280 --> 00:09:13.390Michael Whitaker: rocket up into a space that'sÉ that's unstable, and so, like, I'veÉ you know, I wasÉ I had my first full-length podcast, right? So I went through that, got that out there, É7900:09:13.420 --> 00:09:25.410Michael Whitaker: IÉ this, with Back to School, I've been diving more into the AI school policy side of things, and posting, and got put some stuff up that's got traction, but I think, as importantly, I've had subscribers to my substack.8000:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.800Michael Whitaker: Who are leading writers in that field.8100:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.280Michael Whitaker: that subscribed to mine, I subscribed to theirs. Yeah, that was theÉ.8200:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.400The Alliance: And I'm having side conversations with them.8300:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.460Michael Whitaker: Yeah, that's the question I was gonna ask, because, like, once that starts happeningÉ Yeah.8400:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.330The Alliance: That's theÉ that starts to be the more solid foundation.8500:09:40.330 --> 00:09:57.859Michael Whitaker: Yeah, and I would say, like, you know, leadingÉ they've got a few thousand, or a few hundred to a few thousand subscribers, where I've got, like, 200, right? So, like, they're that 10X of me, in terms of their reach and their talk, which is that ladder-up approach before you can get to the really big, and they areÉ8600:09:58.080 --> 00:10:09.970Michael Whitaker: reading my stuff, some are putting it back out through their channels, but then they're also just, like, we're engaging in side conversations, one-on-one, and starting to develop those relationships, so I'm trying to, like.8700:10:10.360 --> 00:10:18.120Michael Whitaker: strengthen that network of people who are active in this space, who I'm starting to have personal relationships with, which then can beÉ8800:10:18.330 --> 00:10:26.989Michael Whitaker: a venue through which to get my voice out more, or, you know, even just to make the impact that I'm trying to make this school year, which is this kind of urgent period.8900:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.030The Alliance: do things.9000:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.399The Alliance: one, and I don't know what it looks like for Substack, but, É9100:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.379The Alliance: Or, sure, with your newsletter topic.9200:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.599The Alliance: Because there's noÉ a lot of people want that information, nobody even knows that people are talking about it, right?9300:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.730The Alliance: I would putÉ Minimal ad budget behind it.9400:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.290Michael Whitaker: Okay.9500:10:50.880 --> 00:11:00.450The Alliance: That's, I mean, like, minimal. I'm talking, like, you know, $100, $200 a month, you know what I mean? Like, literally minimal. And just see if you can start9600:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.830The Alliance: Growing your subscribers, and the otherÉ Question I would askÉ9700:11:07.240 --> 00:11:24.579The Alliance: And I don't know where I would have asked this again, because Substack, like, I choseÉ our newsletter was so big, I was like, if I move on to Substack, I'm just giving up revenue. Like, it doesn't make any sense. Like, they'reÉ I've got what they're trying to get people, so I don't, like, I don't need them, so I didn't move under, so I don't know these metrics, but, É9800:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.920The Alliance: historically.9900:11:27.260 --> 00:11:38.179The Alliance: everything, like, all the social media, there's a tipping point, right? Like, there's aÉ there's a bottom rung number you're trying to get to in terms of dollars. I often think, like.10000:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.919The Alliance: You go for, likeÉ10100:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.430The Alliance: forÉ I'll give you an example. If you reach out to me on Instagram, and I don't know you.10200:11:49.630 --> 00:12:07.190The Alliance: and your follower count is sort of under 15,000, I'm probably ignoring you, right? I'm probably flat-out ignoring you, because I don't, like, I just don't trust it at that point. When it's a little over, I startÉ you know, I want to know what those thresholds are, just so you have some benchmarks.10300:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.170Michael Whitaker: Okay.10400:12:08.930 --> 00:12:15.080The Alliance: Right? There's, like, with Instagram, there's a point you get to, and I'm stillÉ edging towards it.10500:12:15.210 --> 00:12:24.730The Alliance: Where they have 6 or 7 internal numbers that they look at, and once you start hitting more of them, their algorithm opens you up to more.10600:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.630Michael Whitaker: Interesting, so Substack probably has something similar, where they're gonna then startÉ you're gonna start to show up in the feeds more, and start to get.10700:12:30.630 --> 00:12:49.640The Alliance: Yeah, exactly. So you just want toÉ you just want to sort of figure out what that is, and then figure out if you can use advertising to sort of move youÉ you know, if youÉ if you'reÉ like, I wouldn't have suggested this if you wereÉ were like, I'm cool with this pace, but if you're not cool with the pace, well, there's aÉ there's a pretty standard way to do that.10800:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.600Michael Whitaker: get.10900:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.759Michael Whitaker: Yeah, and then I gotta think what the right channels are, too.11000:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.139Michael Whitaker: Go grab those subscribers.11100:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.780The Alliance: Yeah, and Ida.11200:12:57.780 --> 00:13:13.609Michael Whitaker: that are on Substack, but there's also the, like, how do you get people that are interested in this space that aren't, likeÉ I mean, I would be reposting immediately on LinkedIn. I repost everything on LinkedIn, absolutely. Like, all my articles, all my interviews, little video snippets, so I'm doing that.11300:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.499The Alliance: So here's the real.11400:13:14.500 --> 00:13:14.890Michael Whitaker: But I'm notÉ.11500:13:14.890 --> 00:13:27.860The Alliance: Yeah, here's this cool thing about LinkedIn advertising that I learned, and I haven't spent money on it because I find this a, both an asset and a limitation, but IÉ it's very foremost in my mind the next time I launch a book, which isÉ11600:13:27.920 --> 00:13:44.460The Alliance: LinkedIn allows you to micro-target ads. They're more expensive than other people, but you actually get to exactly who you want to get to, and you could test your product in different audiences that way. You know what I mean? You could hunt for weird pockets of audiences, you could do.11700:13:44.460 --> 00:13:44.790Michael Whitaker: Yeah.11800:13:44.790 --> 00:13:53.219The Alliance: sort of stuff. You know, I don't think a $100 experimental budget a week is, you know, is terrible, or 50 bucks is, you know what I mean.11900:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.030Michael Whitaker: Yeah, no, that makes sense. É12000:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.439Michael Whitaker: The other thing I did this last week is I went and did public comment at our school board meeting, so I was the only one.12100:14:02.440 --> 00:14:11.830The Alliance: only one that talked and got them engaged. I actually had a reporter come up to me afterwards and take my information, because she's interested in the topic, so now we're connected, so I'm trying to get the, like.12200:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.279Michael Whitaker: EarnedÉ potentially the earned media hit.12300:14:14.850 --> 00:14:27.139The Alliance: Her media is great. The other thing you might consider, I don't know if you're on the book face, but you know the book face is an archaic technology that nobody's on anymore, except for suburban moms and grandparents.12400:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.699Michael Whitaker: Yeah, I may have to, É I may.12500:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.440The Alliance: Right.12600:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.890Michael Whitaker: cross-post. I deleted my account, because IÉ.12700:14:31.890 --> 00:14:42.070The Alliance: Look, I got issues with Mark Zuckerberg, I got issues with Facebook, I hadÉ my account, literally, I let it go to totally dead, and I realized I was goingÉ12800:14:42.280 --> 00:14:58.530The Alliance: to my 40th high school reunion in a couple of weeks, and, being that I haven't been in contact with any of those people, except on Facebook, in 30 years, I was like, oh, fuck. And so I re-sorta, like, activated a little bit, but I fucking hate Facebook.12900:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.510Michael Whitaker: Yeah.13000:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.740Michael Whitaker: É13100:15:00.910 --> 00:15:07.439Michael Whitaker: Okay, yeah, LinkedIn and Substack, a little bit of X, but those are the places I've been playing the most. I don'tÉ.13200:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.699The Alliance: Yeah, I think, I thinkÉ.13300:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.170Michael Whitaker: ButÉ.13400:15:09.170 --> 00:15:22.129The Alliance: I think that's what I would do, though I would only look at Facebook, because it'sÉ there's aÉ it's aÉ it's very much a target audience for, you know what I mean? Like, itÉ it is, it's likeÉ it's like white moms, you know what I mean?13500:15:22.130 --> 00:15:29.649Michael Whitaker: Yeah, I'll have my wifeÉ my wife can cross-post my stuff through there, because she's still on there, andÉ and then I've been reaching out to some of theÉ13600:15:29.860 --> 00:15:43.000Michael Whitaker: kind of institutes that are doing this research, like Stanford's got, like, doing research on AI and education and trying to promote that out, so I sent them a note yesterday with some of my postings. I, É13700:15:43.330 --> 00:15:49.199Michael Whitaker: you know, even the AI, Stanford alums and AI list, I put it out there, which got some interest in crossÉ.13800:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.919The Alliance: Listen, what'sÉ.13900:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.140Michael Whitaker: So I'm trying to, like.14000:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.440The Alliance: Good, okay, go in your house.14100:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.190Michael Whitaker: Things, yeah.14200:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.769The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, by the way, when it comes to that stuff.14300:15:56.910 --> 00:16:15.310The Alliance: my philosophy is, like, once I figure out what it is that I'm doing, I, like, one to two things a day, so I've set limits around it, because otherwise, it, like, hijacks your brain in ways I don't want it to, right? Then you start caring about things that, like, are not exactly why you got into this.14400:16:15.310 --> 00:16:33.200Michael Whitaker: Yeah. Yeah, no, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to start each day with, I guess a little bit of the network build, I would call it, so whether that's responding to somebody else's post on Substack, or, you know, restacking their note with my comments that then connects me to them, that then brings it in and tries to grow it to voices thatÉ14500:16:33.360 --> 00:16:42.419Michael Whitaker: I think are important, or, you know, reaching out to the research institutes and those kind of things. I'm not, you know, I'm not selling anything yet, right? So I'm not just trying to drive14600:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.020Michael Whitaker: Revenue to a consumer.14700:16:44.020 --> 00:16:50.589The Alliance: Dude, I wouldÉ yeah, I wouldn't sell anyÉ I mean, I wouldn't consider selling anything until you had a coupleÉ 10,000 subscribers. Yeah.14800:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.020Michael Whitaker: Yeah, like.14900:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.910The Alliance: Minimum.15000:16:51.910 --> 00:17:08.700Michael Whitaker: I'm not in any hurry to do that. What I'm really trying to do is toÉ there's this, like, back-to-school window right now, where the schools are woefully unprepared to have the AI conversation with their students and parents, and so I'm really pounding that topic, because it's also front of mind forÉ15100:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.550Michael Whitaker: the parents, and, you know, even the school board. I had two school board members echo myÉ I was the only one to give public comment.15200:17:15.780 --> 00:17:24.729Michael Whitaker: two of them kept coming back to it and said, we should put this up higher up on the agenda. I'm gonna go back to their meeting, like, I'm gonna press them, and I'm pressing both my kids' schools, and then I'm gonna have these stories ofÉ.15300:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.470The Alliance: You know what, I actually know what?15400:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.520Michael Whitaker: What? Yeah.15500:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.790The Alliance: Keep going.15600:17:29.790 --> 00:17:39.690Michael Whitaker: And I actuallyÉ one thing, like, in my post, which was kind of, like, people really resonated with this, like, I went hunting for this policy, the AI policy for the schools in the district.15700:17:39.750 --> 00:17:49.199Michael Whitaker: And it's so convoluted and buried that I actually had to use AI to do deep research to try to find it, and then I had the AI create a simplified one-page website15800:17:49.220 --> 00:18:07.000Michael Whitaker: that I think is the policy, but nobody can actually tell me if it's the policy, because it's so buried. And then I handed that to the CIO of the school district, and I published it on my newsletter, this sample webpage, of what I would want the district to tell me and tell my kids in simplified language of it. So I went from15900:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.749Michael Whitaker: Like, my problem all the way to a simplified solution, not just complaining.16000:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.610Michael Whitaker: And I think that resonated with people, like.16100:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.260The Alliance: I know.16200:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.890Michael Whitaker: Let me ask you a question, is it, É.16300:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.310The Alliance: You're aware.16400:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.119The Alliance: Where are you?16500:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.440Michael Whitaker: I'm in Boulder, Colorado.16600:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.600The Alliance: the search flow.16700:18:25.130 --> 00:18:31.470The Alliance: HowÉ like, you could be, like, a volunteer16800:18:31.890 --> 00:18:39.069The Alliance: who, like, you could do the same thing for every district. Review their policy, and then volunteer to host a meeting.16900:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.650The Alliance: for the parents.17000:18:41.470 --> 00:18:47.669Michael Whitaker: Yeah. I mean, one of the things I was thinking about is, like, do IÉ Create something where, like.17100:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.350Michael Whitaker: Essentially, IÉ IÉ17200:18:50.570 --> 00:19:01.769Michael Whitaker: put in a district, and it gives me, like, it runs the search and gives me back what it thinks the simplified policy is for the district that I can then share with the district, right? Like, that workflow.17300:19:01.770 --> 00:19:09.450The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's what I mean. I would, like, I would do that, and I would use it as a way to try to justÉ17400:19:09.720 --> 00:19:21.850The Alliance: get in front of parents in different districts, because it would be pretty easy to become the voice of Boulder, you know what I mean? Right. At the same time as you're doing what you're doing.17500:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.150The Alliance: Which, É17600:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.130The Alliance: You know, it's a decent way to get a column somewhere in a local newspaper or something like that.17700:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.569Michael Whitaker: Yeah, the other interesting place that I've made a couple connections is New York.17800:19:34.760 --> 00:19:45.770Michael Whitaker: out through this, of just other educators that are publishing through the substack, and, like, we're exchanging ideas and resources and things, and they're coming at it from the educator in the classroom perspective.17900:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.910Michael Whitaker: I'm coming at it from the parent and the professional in this field who's wanting their students toÉ18000:19:51.270 --> 00:19:58.470Michael Whitaker: have access to AI, but do it in a way that it's, you know, additive to the learning environment, isn't prohibited, that's, like, this more forward-leaning.18100:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.260The Alliance: By the way, don't sleep on, É don't sleep on op-eds.18200:20:03.540 --> 00:20:17.850The Alliance: Okay. You canÉ you can op-ed for local papers, if they have an op-ed section. Good idea. And, it's, well, because it looks the same as earned media when people see it on your website, right? Yeah.18300:20:17.850 --> 00:20:26.300The Alliance: they see it laid out, and it doesn'tÉ they don't, likeÉ you know what I mean? So it, like, it functions really well, and I don't know how tight18400:20:26.400 --> 00:20:34.189The Alliance: That is anymore. And, you know, I wouldn't assume many people are gonna read it, but I would assume it's good for your website clip and file.18500:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.530Michael Whitaker: Right.18600:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.200The Alliance: Right?18700:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.519The Alliance: You gotta remember, this isÉ soÉ18800:20:42.140 --> 00:20:48.589The Alliance: One way to know you got to the next level you're going to is somebody's gonna hire you for, like, a 5K speech.18900:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.709Michael Whitaker: Right. Starter speech at 5K.19000:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.909The Alliance: And, É19100:20:54.370 --> 00:21:01.640The Alliance: that's how you know, like, you've got to, like, level one, right? Like, someÉ like, I would never consider19200:21:01.960 --> 00:21:15.460The Alliance: starting my own workshop till, like, people were regularly hiring me for speeches, because otherwise my name's not big enough, and I've got no funnel into my, like, really into myÉ into my workshops other than this substack.19300:21:15.460 --> 00:21:24.169The Alliance: Which everybody's using as a funnel. You know, it worksÉ you know, you stand in front of a classroom, you're the only guy there, it's your funnel rather than it's everybody's funnel.19400:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.130The Alliance: So, I, like, I wouldÉ19500:21:27.300 --> 00:21:37.880The Alliance: started thinking about, okay, if you were to hire a speaker for your company, right, and they were 5K, and they were gonna talk on topic X, what19600:21:38.040 --> 00:21:47.610The Alliance: street cred what you want, and then that's what you have toÉ that's what you have to get for yourself. You gotta feelÉ like, for me, theÉ when I started out in journalism, I knew19700:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.120The Alliance: If you hadÉ19800:21:49.340 --> 00:22:03.540The Alliance: one sort of, like, first person I went on an adventure and did this thing, one very good, like, smart political science whatever piece, and then one really tight interview with somebody famous-ish.19900:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.520The Alliance: You could essentiallyÉ those 3 clips.20000:22:07.270 --> 00:22:16.690The Alliance: would get you into any door with any editor back in the early 90s, right? That was theÉ like, they wouldn'tÉ if you didn't have 3 clips that showed20100:22:16.690 --> 00:22:35.250The Alliance: a little bit of breadth, unless they were looking for a very specific niche, you didn't get in the door. So, I always find it's really useful to be like, well, what are the gatekeepers looking for? What do I need, right? In your case, it's probably gonna be, you know, something that leads to a TEDx talk, you know what I mean?20200:22:35.250 --> 00:22:35.580Michael Whitaker: Yeah.20300:22:35.580 --> 00:22:43.679The Alliance: definitely something you want at TEDxBolder is good, you know what I mean? So I'd start figuring out who are the TEDx people, and how do you meet them.20400:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.660Michael Whitaker: Yep.20500:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.380Michael Whitaker: That's a good idea.20600:22:46.670 --> 00:22:52.900Michael Whitaker: I like that. And just for my own knowledge, is 5K kind of, like, Like, a typical earlyÉ20700:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.370Michael Whitaker: speech fee.20800:22:54.370 --> 00:23:09.669The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, like, somebody willÉ sometimes you'll get offered, like, 2K, but, like, 5K is usually about the entry level, and now, there's a fairly big jump. 10K is the first level if you're actually serious.20900:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.590Michael Whitaker: But it's, like, it's hard to get there. Yeah.21000:23:13.050 --> 00:23:19.399The Alliance: YouÉ getting 10K at 15K is easy, actually. Getting above 15KÉ21100:23:21.230 --> 00:23:30.780The Alliance: is, sorry, dogs. My wife took the dogs out of the, like, four dogs just charging into my door. I was like, what the fuck was that? Can't go, it's okay!21200:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.930The Alliance: Bit the shit out of me.21300:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.900The Alliance: É21400:23:37.990 --> 00:23:51.020The Alliance: 15K is easier to get to. 20 and above is where it gets really, really ferociously competitive. Yeah. And then, like, at the level I play at, which isÉ21500:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.109The Alliance: Depending on how many plane flights I take.21600:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.929The Alliance: $35,000 to $120,000, basically, like, that'sÉ Yeah.21700:24:01.310 --> 00:24:08.069The Alliance: like, To get, like, to get from the 25-35 range into the next tier up isÉ21800:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.309The Alliance: Like, that was 10 years' worth of work.21900:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.670Michael Whitaker: Yeah, yeah.22000:24:11.670 --> 00:24:23.479The Alliance: You know what I mean? Like, and to get above it is, like, luck, and bestsellers, and TV appearances and things like that. Right. And it's really easy. Like, I was upÉ22100:24:23.480 --> 00:24:33.439The Alliance: right after I published a book with Peter, and then, like, 6 months later, I'm back down again, because it's really hard to stay. If you're not first to mind, you're not in that tax bracket. É22200:24:34.280 --> 00:24:42.019The Alliance: But, É And you also have to start thinking, if you care, who hires people for speeches?22300:24:42.020 --> 00:25:00.259The Alliance: Right? You're in a weird category, because companies aren't going to bring you in to talk to parents. Right. Right? So, youÉ that's, É you're more in the education category, which always pays less anyways. Yeah. Like, when I go speak at a university, fuck it. Like, I'll speak at a university forÉ22400:25:00.360 --> 00:25:10.609The Alliance: $10,000, because I know that's their upper fucking limit, or $15,000, and it's just, you know, it'sÉ I like speaking to college students, also, you know.22500:25:11.900 --> 00:25:18.540Michael Whitaker: Yeah, theÉ I mean, even theÉ the unpaid talks are interesting at this point, right? Like, the TEDxes and things, it's just like, how do you get.22600:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.429The Alliance: Oh, I didn't get your post.22700:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.130Michael Whitaker: platform.22800:25:20.310 --> 00:25:28.799The Alliance: don'tÉ don't sleep on the unpaid talks. I mean, I, like, I'm gonnaÉ I did a free talk for my friend Nicole, right, and you went to at Human Tech Week.22900:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.160Michael Whitaker: Yep.23000:25:29.160 --> 00:25:35.700The Alliance: And, yeah, sheÉ we traded your tickets for my speech, right? That's what I did. And, É23100:25:35.950 --> 00:25:42.369The Alliance: Which, I don't know how much tickets were, but she still got a discount, whatever they were, right? Like, it doesn't matter, but, É23200:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.710The Alliance: I've gotten.23300:25:45.820 --> 00:25:52.990The Alliance: 14, 15 legit things, that one freebie. Like, literally, like, and I've gottenÉ23400:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.549The Alliance: 50 things on LinkedIn from people, but, like, 15 of them, I was like.23500:25:57.550 --> 00:26:20.500The Alliance: holy shit, I'm realÉ I'm following up on a lot. Like, I was like, wow, that was really wellÉ that was really worth it. I told you, when I told you guys when I was backstage, the green room was poppin', you know what I mean? And itÉ it was poppin'. I could clearly. So, like, yeah, don't sleep on that stuff, but I set a limit to it for me. I'm like, I am willing to doÉ in the beginning, I would do four free speeches a year, one a quarter. Now, I will giveÉ23600:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.770The Alliance: Two away, and one always goes to an environmental cause.23700:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.380Michael Whitaker: Yeah, makes sense.23800:26:27.930 --> 00:26:33.410The Alliance: It's usually a friend and a cause, right? Like, one goes to a friend, the other goes to a cause, but É23900:26:34.430 --> 00:26:40.210The Alliance: É again, not, likeÉ the other thing is that you're a great24000:26:41.380 --> 00:26:54.549The Alliance: extrasÉ like, in a human tech week, right? Like, if you keep doing this, IÉ and Nicole does it again, IÉ IÉ you know what I mean? I could be like, hey, youÉ you could use a talk on this, and this guy's good, kind of thing. You know what I mean? So, like, that stuff, too. É24100:26:55.200 --> 00:27:03.790The Alliance: can be worth a damn. Like, you know, people will come to me for various things. You know, if somebody comes to me for this topic, you're the only dude I know in the space, right?24200:27:03.790 --> 00:27:09.690Michael Whitaker: And I'm very open to, like, if youÉ if you hear something, and there's an opportunity, even if it's unpaid, like, I'm happy toÉ.24300:27:09.690 --> 00:27:17.120The Alliance: I'm putting in the sweat equity right now. Totally. Dude, I have to tell you, I just gotta, I just gotta stop, and É24400:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.989The Alliance: I don't, likeÉ do you notice the distance? Do you notice how far you've come from when we met?24500:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.229The Alliance: But I don'.24600:27:25.550 --> 00:27:31.750Michael Whitaker: I, like, I feel much better than IÉ like, back in February, I felt very stagnant, and I didn't know, like.24700:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.350The Alliance: Your face was pinched in February. Yeah, your fucking face was pinched.24800:27:35.830 --> 00:27:40.589The Alliance: It was pitched. No, I likedÉ it was interesting, I was on the phone with, É24900:27:40.590 --> 00:27:58.880The Alliance: Jim Crow, and he's, you know, he's had a lot of breakthroughs along the way as well. He was frickin' glowing. And I was like, whoa! You could see the, like, you could see this in your face, it's really odd, because all theÉ a lot of the stress has melted away. Yeah. And you look a little lessÉ a little less constrained.25000:27:59.230 --> 00:28:15.969Michael Whitaker: I just feel like I have more optionÉ like, I came into this for optionality, and I feel like if IÉ if I needed to go in a different direction from what I'm doing, even for what I'm doing to sustain my family, that I have more pathways to spin something up faster, and thatÉ that was important to me.25100:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.759The Alliance: To me, the most important thing is, is, isÉ25200:28:23.050 --> 00:28:37.310The Alliance: Well, I always say that safety is multiple streams of income, one. In any market, safety is multiple streams of income, just like a diversified portfolio on the back end for your retirement, right? You want it on the front end if you can get it, and É25300:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.129The Alliance: But itÉ what I love about that is when shit goes wrong.25400:28:44.820 --> 00:29:03.660The Alliance: the fear response is so much smaller, because there's fallback. So you actually end up navigating life's challenges much more gracefully, because you know you have options, and you know this, like, there's stuff going on, so I, like, I find that, like, the dividends of that25500:29:03.740 --> 00:29:09.269The Alliance: are really significant over time, from a safety and security and stress level perspective.25600:29:09.970 --> 00:29:16.720Michael Whitaker: Well, I appreciate you pointing out, like, that you've seen an evolution in me since February. You know, anything else? Like, what am IÉ what am I missing? What am I, É.25700:29:17.080 --> 00:29:28.169The Alliance: Oh, yeah, I will tell you, I willÉ I will tell you this, because I listened to your comment very clearly, when you were talking to, Ivy andÉ and,25800:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.830The Alliance: Jody, and one of the things I willÉ25900:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.800The Alliance: say is, if you choose to26000:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.369The Alliance: Point your own terms for stuff, and rebrand stuff.26100:29:41.590 --> 00:29:51.399The Alliance: In my opinion, and most people's sort of reaction to it, in my experience, is if you haven't significantly added to the body of knowledge.26200:29:51.400 --> 00:30:15.380The Alliance: you haven't earned your own label. People feelÉ they react to it like you're a marketer, not like you're an expert. So, I don'tÉ and IÉ and by the way, you were talking, and I, like, I didn't really know how much was you, and how much was other stuff, but that's whatÉ that was in my mind, and I was like, oh, that's in Jody's mind, and Ivy's mind, too, which is like, where's the original thinking here?26300:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.220The Alliance: Or is this just marketing? Because, like.26400:30:18.860 --> 00:30:30.480The Alliance: itÉ there's a lot of marketing of that sort, so I, like, I would, like, always, always, like, not only do the original thinking, but when you're introducing it.26500:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.939The Alliance: And you've rebranded something.26600:30:33.270 --> 00:30:47.330The Alliance: Give them a reason. Tell them why you've rebranded it. Hey, IÉ now, scientists do it all the time. They find micro differences between what used to be and what is now, and then they rebrand it. And that's kind of likeÉ26700:30:47.590 --> 00:30:57.839The Alliance: IÉ I don't like it a lot, because it distorted flow research. It made it really hard in the beginning for me, because there were, like, 50 terms, and, like, which was the right term, man?26800:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.670Michael Whitaker: Right.26900:30:59.050 --> 00:30:59.760Michael Whitaker: Okay.27000:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.530Michael Whitaker: That makes sense.27100:31:00.530 --> 00:31:19.040The Alliance: And the other thing is, if you do that, you put yourself inside the evolution of the field, of the intellect. Like, that's whatÉ what you want to be, right, is, like, I put myselfÉ you cannot talk about the lineage of altered states research.27200:31:19.170 --> 00:31:38.460The Alliance: without my name at this point. You just can't do it. Like, if you're gonna talk about Huxley and Leary and those guys, if you're gonna take it into the modern world, you have to mention me in a sentence. And IÉ like, that wasÉ I aimed for that. That was intentional. Yeah. Like, I wanted that. That was the conversation I wanted to contribute to, or one of them.27300:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.550The Alliance: AndÉ27400:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.750The Alliance: IÉ you know what I mean? Like, when people have to talk about you, you've actually made a contribÉ contribution. You know what I mean?27500:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.100Michael Whitaker: Yep.27600:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.169The Alliance: I'm not saying I'm the only guy you have to talk about, that's for later.27700:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.180The Alliance: Soon, soon I will be.27800:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.030Michael Whitaker: Yep.27900:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.640Michael Whitaker: Okay, that totally makes sense.28000:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.510The Alliance: Makes sense.28100:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.540Michael Whitaker: Yep, absolutely.28200:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.289The Alliance: That was theÉ that was theÉ thatÉ that was the only other thing, andÉ and theÉ28300:32:04.080 --> 00:32:12.449The Alliance: The other thing I have to tell you, because you may notÉ maybe you know it, maybe you don't, you'reÉ I don't even know how toÉ28400:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.240The Alliance: Think about it, but, likeÉ They're, like.28500:32:18.080 --> 00:32:32.959The Alliance: intellectual organizational skills, you can sort of do what I can do. You can look at something really complicated, and break it in parts, and see how it fits together, and see what works, and move itÉ start to move it around, and you do it. I can do it incredibly well for science.28600:32:33.140 --> 00:32:50.320The Alliance: Usually for reading people, because that's a journalist thing, right? And it makes me good at my job. A couple other things. You can do it for businesses, for orgs, in really interesting ways. And the only thing I will tell you, and I'm not telling you you have to do this now, butÉ28700:32:51.620 --> 00:33:02.199The Alliance: there is going to be some down-the-line connection between how you think business-wise and the AI parent. Like, when those things start to come together.28800:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.199The Alliance: That's a space you're gonna own.28900:33:05.340 --> 00:33:28.219The Alliance: Because then you're taking allÉ when I listen to you in the AI space, the only thing I wonder, and I don't know, is has he brought his invisible skills along for the ride? Because you haven't brought your invisible skills along for the ride, you're missing, sort of, where a lot of the opportunity is going to end up, but you may not be deep enough in this space yet to have a clue.29000:33:28.220 --> 00:33:42.369The Alliance: So that would be, like, but that would be something I would be looking for and a little bit thinking about, just at a high-level, you know, high-level way, because you haveÉ you have aÉ it's a very clear superpower, andÉ29100:33:42.370 --> 00:33:47.759The Alliance: Just listening to you talk in a meeting, it's very clearly on display.29200:33:47.990 --> 00:34:06.479The Alliance: less so when you talk about AI and parenting. Your information is good, you're, like, right, you see what I'mÉ you see whatÉ Yeah. Like, it hasn't fully moreÉ and it won't, like, probably for a little while, could be a couple years, but I just wanted you to just, likeÉ and I don't know, I couldn't begin to tell you what that intersection is. Yeah. Right?29300:34:07.050 --> 00:34:11.190Michael Whitaker: And what do youÉ like, when you say invisible skills, what do you call an invisible skills?29400:34:11.530 --> 00:34:27.289The Alliance: So, I'll give you the best example I ever heard, and where the phrase came from. It came from my friend Micah Abrams, and he was trying to describe skier Shane McConkie, and why he was the best skier in the world, because if you look at Shane compared to the other early skiers.29500:34:28.670 --> 00:34:39.279The Alliance: he's notÉ he's not a pretty skier in comparison to, like, Pent Kreitler, where you're like, look at that power, like, he's just not, and I was just like, well, what? And Micah said.29600:34:39.580 --> 00:34:57.329The Alliance: can see lines down the mountain that nobody else can see. And then he can go skis them. And that's what he does. He can see lines. That's his superpower. And like I said, he's like, it's an invisible skill. Nobody sees it, you can't see it, and usually his line is too fast, like, you don't even notice it.29700:34:57.480 --> 00:35:04.640The Alliance: And then you look up, and you're like, how did heÉ what? But, so that was the first time I started thinking about it, and I started to think about, like.29800:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.960The Alliance: One of myÉ like, on a resume, you would say, Steven has good communication skills.29900:35:10.100 --> 00:35:17.650The Alliance: Right? Or something like that. Right. That's actually not what the skill is. The skill is that I can figure out what language almost anybody on the planet speaks.30000:35:17.740 --> 00:35:30.750The Alliance: If IÉ you know what I mean? Like, whatever class level, person, sexuality, whatever, and I can speak that language to them. Yeah. I'm gonna find a way to connect with them on something they care about, and I can usually do it in a minute or two.30100:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.180Michael Whitaker: Yep.30200:35:31.180 --> 00:35:48.660The Alliance: Right? And, that isÉ that'sÉ that's the reason I'mÉ I was a great journalist, right? Like, that was the reason that, like, people told me shit they didn't want to tell other people, and all that stuff, right? So that was an invisible skill, and it, you know.30300:35:48.790 --> 00:35:59.890The Alliance: it's notÉ it doesn'tÉ the stuff that shows up on the website doesn'tÉ you know, you can'tÉ you have to talk about that, and people are like, well, what do you mean? And I, you know, that sort of stuff. So I always try to think, like.30400:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.579The Alliance: what do I do?30500:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.649The Alliance: That really sort of sets me apart at a party, in a room.30600:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.060Michael Whitaker: Yeah.30700:36:07.060 --> 00:36:16.649The Alliance: talked in a conversation, like, all those stuff in a business meeting, like, what are the stuffÉ and what is the stuff that nobody sees, where I'm like, how come your brain can't doÉ so, like.30800:36:16.650 --> 00:36:16.990Michael Whitaker: Yeah.30900:36:16.990 --> 00:36:28.070The Alliance: I can spot the cutting edge and links between things. That's another, right? Like, most people have no idea where the cutting edgeÉ they couldn't findÉ and I, like, I literallyÉ31000:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.200The Alliance: Could not find it.31100:36:30.200 --> 00:36:39.890Michael Whitaker: You know what I mean? It resonates, I mean, it's definitely the way my brain works, and that I show up and meetÉ and sometimes, like, part of my challenge is bringing others along with the thinking that got me toÉ31200:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.319Michael Whitaker: the spots, so that I don't lose them in the journey, particularly as I'm trying toÉ.31300:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.879The Alliance: You know, there's.31400:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.490Michael Whitaker: Excellent.31500:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.090The Alliance: my Randoras. If you put Randoras in a crowded room.31600:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.559The Alliance: He's going to actually end up standing next to the wealthiest person in the room.31700:36:55.610 --> 00:37:06.600The Alliance: fucking business with them. It will happen automatically, you won't seek them out, it'll happen automatically. You put me in a room, I'm gonna find the person with the most fucked up, crazy past.31800:37:06.600 --> 00:37:24.230The Alliance: triumphed over it in some creative, wild-ass way. Yeah. Like, and I willÉ I'm gonna end up standing next to them and having a conversation. Like, that'sÉ like, I don't know what that is, but it's happened for 50 years, so, like, I just know that happens in my life, and that's, you knowÉ.31900:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.200Michael Whitaker: Yeah.32000:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.950The Alliance: Explains why so many of my relationshipsÉ Horribly wrong.32100:37:31.090 --> 00:37:35.890Michael Whitaker: I mean, myÉ it was funny, I was actually talking to my wife yesterday, because one of the things she said is, like.32200:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.499Michael Whitaker: sometimes I have to let herÉ32300:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.720Michael Whitaker: Articulate something she's trying to say without articulating it better.32400:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.519Michael Whitaker: Even if it's a struggle, and even if to the kids it'sÉ32500:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.080Michael Whitaker: like, maybe not as impactful, just so that I'm not thenÉ32600:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.150Michael Whitaker: One-upping or stepping, because you, likeÉ32700:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.659Michael Whitaker: You tend to take these complex things and communicate them very concisely and draw the connections, and sometimes we, like.32800:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.610Michael Whitaker: you just gotta let it go, like, just not do that. And I'm like, okay, like, I, you know, and I getÉ.32900:38:03.610 --> 00:38:12.019The Alliance: The other thing you also have to realize is most people, including yourself, draw the connections out loud.33000:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.239The Alliance: Yeah. Right? While speaking, becauseÉ33100:38:15.240 --> 00:38:33.489The Alliance: it does that thing in the brain where it turns off the brain, and the subconscious does its thing, right? So, I do it too, by the way. I do that. I have that exact same problem. I do it too. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Nobody's understanding you. Can I step in here? Like, what? What are you trying to say? You put the orange in the.33200:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.280Michael Whitaker: Right.33300:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.290Michael Whitaker: É.33400:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.729The Alliance: What else is going on?33500:38:40.880 --> 00:38:47.680The Alliance: I've gotÉ I gottaÉ I gotta jump in, like, 4.45. I gottaÉ I'll give you an extra 15, because this is fun. What else can IÉ Yeah.33600:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.260Michael Whitaker: You know, I think this isÉ I mean, this is really helpful, because it's, É33700:38:52.370 --> 00:38:59.629Michael Whitaker: like I said, I'm notÉ like, I'm not pursuing money right now. Like, I'm not. Like, this isÉ this is aboutÉ I think it's a really importantÉ33800:39:00.110 --> 00:39:12.350Michael Whitaker: field that I'm trying to influence and establish my voice in and make the right connections, particularly related to my kids at this time, but that then applies to all their peers and to this generation of students that I think are gonnaÉ33900:39:12.730 --> 00:39:25.460Michael Whitaker: have a tough year, and a tough couple years, and I think the schools are failing to adapt fast enough in this environment, so I think there's this, like, unique window to actually make an influence, and when we talk about, like, justÉ34000:39:25.570 --> 00:39:34.490Michael Whitaker: impact, like, passion, curiosity, and impact. This is impact of, like, real, tangible world impact on humans, notÉ money.34100:39:34.910 --> 00:39:35.780The Alliance: Yeah, in that play.34200:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.659Michael Whitaker: A little bit of a difference.34300:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.040The Alliance: pursue. Yeah, the two things I alwaysÉ point out.34400:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.839The Alliance: And nobodyÉ a lot of people don't like hearing this one. ButÉ34500:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.850The Alliance: When you're trying to come up, and you're talking to experts, wand.34600:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.509The Alliance: weÉ we all spell sticky. If you're sticky, if you're hungry for money, you know what I mean?34700:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.850Michael Whitaker: yet.34800:39:57.850 --> 00:40:05.630The Alliance: WeÉ and nobody wants anything to do with it. And the other thing is, if you're too over-the-top crazy passionate.34900:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.010Michael Whitaker: Right.35000:40:06.010 --> 00:40:11.449The Alliance: Nobody, because, like, if you've been around the block long enough, like, that's been sort of honed down a little bit.35100:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.840Michael Whitaker: Yeah.35200:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.869The Alliance: You know what I mean? And É35300:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.590The Alliance: And my point on that one is those twoÉ like, when you get in a room with experts.35400:40:22.070 --> 00:40:33.640The Alliance: You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, there's aÉ there's a way where you're, like, one of aÉ you know, in the club and out of the club, andÉ by the way, I learned that35500:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.320The Alliance: Go the hard way.35600:40:35.950 --> 00:40:41.459The Alliance: So the hard way. That was a lesson that took, likeÉ I was so used to pitching.35700:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.529Michael Whitaker: Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, it wasÉ I had to, likeÉ.35800:40:44.570 --> 00:40:55.790The Alliance: that part of me had to die. And then once itÉ once I quieted it down, I started to see it. Like, Peter Diamandis still can't help himself, and he embarrasses the shit out of everybody who loves him.35900:40:55.790 --> 00:41:04.599The Alliance: We're like, Peter, you're Peter, you can stop. Like, you don't have to do this anyÉ like, really, you could have put it down 20 years ago, you don't have to do this anymore.36000:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.279The Alliance: É Yeah, I thoughtÉ Somebody said to meÉ36100:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.360The Alliance: First half of your career, you promote, second half, you attract.36200:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.850Michael Whitaker: Yeah.36300:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.920The Alliance: You have to know where that hinges.36400:41:14.420 --> 00:41:21.090Michael Whitaker: Yeah, that's a good one. É I'm very, very intentionally trying toÉ strike aÉ36500:41:21.150 --> 00:41:35.139Michael Whitaker: a pragmatic tone in what I'm doing. Like, I'm trying to avoid the alarmist. There's too much clickbait around this, and the, like, everything's falling apart, or there's, like, one end of the spectrum or the other, and I truly think it's in the middle. Like, I'm trying to be the voice that's, like.36600:41:35.140 --> 00:41:41.650Michael Whitaker: Real solution, not just complaining, real solutions, not alarmist, pragmatic, and kind of understanding the sides.36700:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.790The Alliance: Dude, I, like, that's fine.36800:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.179The Alliance: Yeah, that'sÉ I mean, I built my career on, like.36900:41:47.180 --> 00:42:05.890The Alliance: deep wisdom explained practically, basically. You know what I mean? AndÉ because I just thought it was the gap in the space, and it was the same thing. The alarmist stuff made me crazy, and the overhyped stuff made me crazy. And I was just like, there's got to beÉ can't we? The middle path. I'm a big fan of the middle path.37000:42:05.890 --> 00:42:11.189Michael Whitaker: And that's why I'm okay with, like, the slow build on stuff, because I feel like some of the fast build, it's like you're going for the clickbait, right?37100:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.409The Alliance: That's the only one.37200:42:12.410 --> 00:42:17.439Michael Whitaker: not, like, that's not me, I'm notÉ like, that's not authentically me, and I can'tÉ I can't stay in that space.37300:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.659The Alliance: I can't sta- it doesn't work.37400:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.779The Alliance: In the end, you burn people out.37500:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.300Michael Whitaker: Yeah.37600:42:23.570 --> 00:42:43.509The Alliance: Right? Because youÉ you only get the fearmongers in the beginÉ when they're dumb. Once they've learned some shit, they're on to other bloggers. They're on to other sources, right? You're not a source for anything other than the alarm that catches their attention. So it doesn'tÉ it backfires on people anyways, unless you're, like, the top alarmist.37700:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.130Michael Whitaker: Right.37800:42:44.130 --> 00:42:56.260The Alliance: you know, who wants to be that? What a horrible way to live. What a horrible way to live, right? Yeah, what a horrible thing. I like what you're doing. I think that'sÉ I think it's allÉ that all sounds really smart to me. I like it a lot. You're coming to New York?37900:42:56.260 --> 00:43:07.180Michael Whitaker: I am, yeah. Fabulous. I've got my flight there, I'm staying at a hotel nearby, like, just, like, a short walk away. I'm not sure exactly when I'm going home yet, but I'm coming in on Friday, midday.38000:43:07.180 --> 00:43:07.579The Alliance: It's gonna be a.38100:43:07.580 --> 00:43:18.740Michael Whitaker: Yeah, so I guess the one ask from you is just, like, ears open in your network. If you're hearing people that just, like, want to talk, interesting opportunities to talk or engage in this space that I'm playing in.38200:43:18.960 --> 00:43:29.640Michael Whitaker: with people coming up, whether that's an event, a podcast, an interview, or someÉ talking to somebody, like, I'm wide open, you know, any of that stuff, or even a guest post kind of thing.38300:43:29.640 --> 00:43:48.760The Alliance: Yeah, there'sÉ so, the thing I'm thinkingÉ so there's a guy out of MIT, D. Kai, D-E-K-A-I, two words, he just wrote a book. Well, he basically rewrote Mo Gadot's book, it's called Raising AI, but he wasÉ he was actuallyÉ he predates Mo by a while. He hasÉ he's just aboutÉ38400:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.290The Alliance: It's the same message as Moe. Be nice to AI, because we're raising them like children.38500:43:53.940 --> 00:44:03.449The Alliance: here's the thing, I've been at 2É he was atÉ he was at Human Tech Week with us, and he's been at, like, two other conferences. I've seen him speak, he's okay, but he's gotÉ38600:44:03.860 --> 00:44:19.859The Alliance: Super street cred, doesn't matter. The thing that I noticed with him is he is super hungry to network, right, to have conversations. So, like, you could even reach out to guys like that and be like, hey, I do this on Substack.38700:44:19.910 --> 00:44:37.569The Alliance: I love your book, I'm interested, what is your opinion? You know, I know you're talking about raising AI with children, how should AI raise our children? Just flip it over and ask him an interesting question, and, you know, could I interview you? Can youÉ because he's hungry. He's hungry for attention right now.38800:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.459The Alliance: you know, I wouldÉ the first thing I would do isÉ38900:44:41.760 --> 00:44:57.749The Alliance: Actually, this isÉ so I would also make a list ofÉ I'd go look at what are all the recently published AI books, right? Which ones have tractions, right? Take aÉ you know, whicheverÉ any author you like of a recent AI book, definitely know their work, you know what I mean? Really know it.39000:44:57.750 --> 00:45:16.540The Alliance: ButÉ and try to find some good connections between your stuff, and be up front. Be like, hey, I've got a substack, it's not a huge audience yet, but it's very devoted, and we're very inside this topic, and there aren't a lot of other places for information kind of thing. You could do that kind of stuff.39100:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.560The Alliance: Some of those people are gonna start saying yes, and you're gonna build relationships.39200:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.240Michael Whitaker: Okay.39300:45:22.840 --> 00:45:31.219The Alliance: Right? And also, if you build the proper relationships, When you write your book, They can blurb it.39400:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.160Michael Whitaker: Yep.39500:45:32.650 --> 00:45:37.130The Alliance: You're starting now to cultivate the relationships you're gonna need for blurbs.39600:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.679The Alliance: But you're gonna need to sell your book anyways.39700:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.780Michael Whitaker: Right.39800:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.910Michael Whitaker: Cool. I know you gotta run. Thanks, Steven. Appreciate the extra time.39900:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.499The Alliance: My pleasure. I will see you in New York.40000:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.649Michael Whitaker: Yep, alright, bye.
