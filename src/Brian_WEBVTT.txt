WEBVTT100:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.830brian camastral: Hi, Steven!200:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.679The Alliance: Good morning. How are you.300:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.110brian camastral: I'm great. How about you?400:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.339The Alliance: I'm good. You are 1st co-training call500:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.620The Alliance: in history. It's okay. I'm nothing but not nervous.600:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.874brian camastral: I hope you had fun skiing yesterday.700:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.369The Alliance: It was a blast. We had fun. Everybody kicked ass.800:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.629brian camastral: So just out of respect. How long do we have.900:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.770The Alliance: We have an hour, an hour. Okay.1000:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.141The Alliance: for call one. We have an hour. We don't have to use it all. If if you don't need it.1100:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.670The Alliance: And I wanted to kick off before sort of we get into more gritty details.1200:01:11.970 --> 00:01:27.779The Alliance: It was an intense couple of days data dump. And you came in with with a grand challenge and a masterpiece. And have you had time to think about what you've learned and how it applies, and and what where's the next step?1300:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.950brian camastral: I have I had 3 key takeaways.1400:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.430brian camastral: I we've we've mentioned some of these, but one is that transformational purpose. Don't talk about it.1500:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.460brian camastral: Landed?1600:01:41.232 --> 00:01:42.979brian camastral: Feels really right.1700:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.450brian camastral: I think I know what to do about that1800:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.709brian camastral: which is call stack work. Right? So1900:01:50.238 --> 00:01:55.009brian camastral: that's great and helpful. Okay, I'll move on unless you want to say something about that.2000:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.160The Alliance: The only question I have about goal stack work.2100:01:58.740 --> 00:02:22.709The Alliance: At a conversation with Peter Diamandis right after after the call or after our thing because I was talking to him. I was like, you know, it's interesting. You know. I see this a lot in this group. People, have you seen it before. How do you think about it? And we both had the same solution. It was retrocasting, and he he thought about retrocasting in a really interesting way that I thought was just sort of like in goal stacking. As a really interesting thing, he said. You got to remember 1st of all.2200:02:23.410 --> 00:02:37.450The Alliance: it's an exponential process. So the 1st question you gotta ask is, where does people want to be in 10 years, or, you know, hopefully, in 10 years, and then cut it in half. Don't ask them to walk it all the way back. Just cut it half. Ask them. Okay, what about 5 years?2300:02:38.220 --> 00:02:58.880The Alliance: Cut that in half to 2 and a half years. And then you know, what about a year? What about a month, and and really get down to next 30 days today. And I thought that was an exciting sort of easier framework than just like the big retrocasting thing that I've thrown out of you guys. I like that a little bit better. I was like, that's manageable. That feels better to me.2400:02:59.620 --> 00:03:11.179brian camastral: Yeah, that sounds beautiful and and very practical, too, right? That that I always work like to work in chunk theory, right? Because at some times when we take on big things.2500:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.500brian camastral: There's so many chunks we have to learn to work in bigger chunks.2600:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.250brian camastral: Right? So.2700:03:17.974 --> 00:03:21.960The Alliance: oh, that's interesting. Yeah, I see that idea. That's that's smart.2800:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.099brian camastral: What is what? What is the bigger chunk right now?2900:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.274brian camastral: Well, I I mean3000:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.750brian camastral: The opportunity for me is to define. You know I've done. I've done a lot of work with big, hairy, audacious goals.3100:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.320The Alliance: There!3200:03:36.340 --> 00:03:47.219brian camastral: But I don't think right now. I need to think what I need to tap into is true passion and curiosity, something that captivates me that just pulls me towards it.3300:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.950brian camastral: and it's less important which one of these, the 15, 2 and a half maybe.3400:03:53.950 --> 00:04:03.220The Alliance: Oh, then, which one? Yeah, then you're I mean. Then you're looking at the passion recipe all over again, like looking at the intersections of multiple curiosities, and just playing there to see3500:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.450The Alliance: where the questions keep emerging, or if they start to fade off.3600:04:07.720 --> 00:04:18.250brian camastral: Well, when I when I decided to bike across the country right I you know, I told myself the story that I would die if I didn't, because of my3700:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.160brian camastral: hard family heart history.3800:04:20.907 --> 00:04:36.029brian camastral: So I I was able to stack up a series of goals related to that, but that I I really played that one right and exaggerated it. Blah blah! But I I needed multiple sources of fuel to train3900:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.760brian camastral: for 6,000 miles to ride 4,000 miles if you will. So right now I'm I'm just looking for fuel.4000:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.130brian camastral: It's less important that I get it right than I get the the vector in the right direction.4100:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.600brian camastral: and that I have fuel to start getting some stuff done.4200:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.560brian camastral: But.4300:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.109The Alliance: That's dope I mean, like, that's that's that's great. I mean, you know what I mean like I meaning the 1st time I talked to you to hear.4400:05:01.410 --> 00:05:18.129The Alliance: That's a great, great next step, Sarah Sarkis, who's who's you'll meet her in a couple of weeks, always says that we're facing a crisis, and I don't think I think the word crisis is I don't mean capital CI mean even small C, so if you can see 3 steps ahead. You're winning.4500:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.419The Alliance: And I I think sometimes when it comes to like these kind of soul churning moments4600:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.859The Alliance: 3 steps ahead is definitely winning. It sounds like you you would. You're at least 3 steps ahead now.4700:05:30.510 --> 00:05:43.830brian camastral: Yeah, I I believe I know which where the vector goes. I just now need to find the right size chunks that with the fuel that pull me towards them, because I will go faster and more effectively, and4800:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.239brian camastral: about the whole thing.4900:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.119The Alliance: Let me ask you one question. This may not be a question you answered today. This just5000:05:49.630 --> 00:06:10.510The Alliance: been in my head since we 1st talked it really got emphasized again. We were sitting outside the class after after everything. And you listen. I was listening to you. You have said a number of times that you think. And this is this is a really wild statement to me, because I I would never think this way. But I see exactly where you're coming from, that that essentially coaching5100:06:10.510 --> 00:06:30.299The Alliance: is the single best thing you do for you could do for the world. Especially at the CEO level. And I'm not saying it's not. I'm really just curious. If you've really broken that down to its dub components and really investigated those sub components as places to intersect other curiosity.5200:06:30.860 --> 00:06:39.819brian camastral: So I think, where, where I'm I'm not clear is coaching is natural, and it takes less collaboration.5300:06:40.250 --> 00:06:49.360brian camastral: But the potential contribution is tiny versus what's possible with a collaborative group.5400:06:49.620 --> 00:07:00.220brian camastral: And my true towering strengths show up when I'm orchestrating. It doesn't have to be leading. But I'm from with a5500:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.400brian camastral: a larger group, right with with a shared goal which5600:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.945brian camastral: I need to be careful about making5700:07:10.980 --> 00:07:34.260brian camastral: drawing too much attention to that. But if if the group is headed in the same vector right then we can all collaborate for mutually winning outcomes, supporting each other and amping up the contributions, each of us can make right? So my dilemma is what I'm best at is leading a large group in a complex situation.5800:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.339brian camastral: But it doesn't mean controlling, you know when when I went.5900:07:39.340 --> 00:07:51.056The Alliance: So you I just I gotta pause you because you got I got the next book for you that you're gonna fucking love. It's tiny team flow by Oren Davis, and6000:07:53.590 --> 00:07:59.760The Alliance: God! What's his 1st name? Hold on, Vander Vander Vander! Oh, my God! Why did I just blank his name. It's right behind me.6100:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.320The Alliance: Team flow.6200:08:02.160 --> 00:08:23.380The Alliance: Jeff Vanden, how? And Oren Davis so what? What I got really excited about, and why I interrupted. You is what you're calling a shared goal, and exactly how you defined it. So there's been a lot of group flow research. The original research was Keith Sawyer in the book group genius. I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it got massively updated by6300:08:24.110 --> 00:08:53.320The Alliance: Oren, and mostly Jeff Vanderhall. We did a you could find a really cool podcast. We did with Jeff on this book any little book, but at the center of their work that I'll set up is this idea of collective ambition which is exactly the start of group flow. It starts with collective ambition, which is, it's got some of the shared gold properties that Keith Sawyer identified as a trigger. Right? Shared goals is his, and they say, No, no, but you get need collective ambition. So collective ambition is a thing where everybody's got. These individual desires6400:08:54.020 --> 00:09:11.010The Alliance: do whatever to go scale up. But if you put, point them all interaction, you need each other to for everybody to get what they individually want. Right? So the company wants X. Each individual wants promotion, more money, more prestige whatever. And the X is how we all get that6500:09:11.300 --> 00:09:18.790The Alliance: right. That's what they mean by collective ambitions. I think it's exactly sort of like at the center of the framework you're trying to develop. And there's good data around that.6600:09:19.210 --> 00:09:28.479brian camastral: I love it. It's absolutely where I my passion goes is to this collective flow territory, which which6700:09:28.670 --> 00:09:41.479brian camastral: is extraordinary, I mean. So I'm I'm written up in a couple of books about being a a super effective high performance teamwork leader, or, you know, high performance teamwork for teams and organizations.6800:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.570The Alliance: That's dope.6900:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.409brian camastral: So I have some experience with it. You know, 20 or 30 years.7000:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.539brian camastral: but it keeps evolving right. And7100:09:51.790 --> 00:10:16.479brian camastral: there's this, this territory, even with Soulcraft, where, when you move from the individual to the collective, there's a midpoint that can be called a team, and the team can be a collective, but it can go beyond a team to a multi-tier, which is sort of like a leader with the direct reports, and a multi tier would bring in all the direct reports of the direct reports.7200:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.239brian camastral: Right is a is a midterm step between a team and an enterprise.7300:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.019brian camastral: Right? So they're they're amplifying and accelerating techniques.7400:10:28.878 --> 00:10:33.560brian camastral: Soulcraft. Bill Potkin writes about all this in his books.7500:10:34.146 --> 00:10:40.389brian camastral: But his work is on the individual, and every time I would get in a debate with him.7600:10:40.802 --> 00:10:47.050brian camastral: You know he'd he'd blow me off kind of, and leave me hanging about the the collective part of it.7700:10:47.370 --> 00:10:54.750brian camastral: and finally he got so sick of me like trying to go into this territory that he said, I don't believe that anymore.7800:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.610brian camastral: Dumb.7900:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.100brian camastral: But then, when it played out, he's passing on the legacy. It's like8000:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.349brian camastral: the the game shifts when you go from a person to a group.8100:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.349brian camastral: and what was a strength in a person8200:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.840brian camastral: becomes a weakness or an obstacle in a group.8300:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.530brian camastral: So I'm watching him screw up his whole8400:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.349brian camastral: life purpose because he's not willing to deal with the group at a different level than the individual.8500:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.469brian camastral: So I just I can't not pursue the collective territory. I just it. It.8600:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.739The Alliance: So 2 things on that 1 1,8700:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.640The Alliance: everything I've done, including the Alliance.8800:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.040brian camastral: Yeah.8900:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.579The Alliance: Sort of a like the things that like where I really get it far and take it all the way through. Invariably9000:11:42.610 --> 00:11:54.280The Alliance: I either really want to prove somebody. I want to prove somebody wrong usually like somebody told me I couldn't do it, but that's not usually enough. That's enough to get me pretty pissed at moving, but it's also9100:11:55.284 --> 00:12:15.500The Alliance: needs to sort of be. I see somebody created a problem right? The flow research collective really came out of the fact that I built this Flow Genome project with Jamie Wheel. And besides Jamie's mental instability, I didn't like. I was training people. I was so frustrated. I was like, you're taking shit. That is really9200:12:15.610 --> 00:12:34.589The Alliance: simple. And you're making complicated so you can sound smart. And I like, I don't like. No, you know what I mean. So I'm with you on that, and I like the idea of sort of like as one of the things that drives me, for it doesn't just have to be curiosity. It could be like this. Dude was doing it wrong, and I gotta get it right and it certainly seems like.9300:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.530The Alliance: I think, in terms of9400:12:40.050 --> 00:12:55.870The Alliance: individuals occupying a category of one like real market strength is when you're sort of in a category, or you've won, maybe a weird category, but like it is very clear to me that there is no other human being on the planet who probably sits at the intersection of big corporate9500:12:56.120 --> 00:13:12.660The Alliance: strategy, shaping, etc, and soul craft like there's no like it's got. You're the only dude with your I mean your experience. You just talked about being written up in books. And I know about your life. And I know a little bit about soul craft. So like that alone is a fertile vector right?9600:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.280brian camastral: Yes.9700:13:14.510 --> 00:13:27.009brian camastral: so I feel like the where the the the trifecta comes together is my corporate leadership experience, where I've not only led results beyond reasonable expectations.9800:13:27.770 --> 00:13:40.269brian camastral: which you know you could call elite performance. But I've coached others to do the same, so that intersection with Soulcraft with. I would like to master9900:13:40.690 --> 00:13:52.070brian camastral: neuroscience at the right level. I don't know what the right level is here, because my, it doesn't mean knowing it as well as you know it, because what your life purpose is is different than mine.10000:13:52.500 --> 00:14:02.439brian camastral: right? So I don't. That level of knowledge isn't the right level of knowledge for me, because it's not about that. It's the right level of knowledge to serve the system I'm10100:14:02.670 --> 00:14:08.289brian camastral: trying to be in, so that you know that that comes to my second point here at the right time.10200:14:09.910 --> 00:14:19.589The Alliance: 2 things. And but I'm gonna just facilitate this. I'm just gonna make this happen for you.10300:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.745The Alliance: along the way. So10400:14:23.130 --> 00:14:41.986The Alliance: thing one. I'm gonna introduce you to Dr. Michael Menino, who's my chief science officer? And you were guys, are. We're gonna meet him a little later on. But I want you to talk to him simply because I want him to tell you about synergy, which is his new company, where they literally can measure, group, flow, brain entrainment, etc, straight in meetings through zoom calls10500:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.639The Alliance: you will.10600:14:45.250 --> 00:14:50.810The Alliance: Those are so that's thing one thing 2, and then I'll tie them together, and then I'll shut up again. Thing 2 is.10700:14:51.110 --> 00:15:15.559The Alliance: I'm now working on a new book with Peter. Right? And it's the problems of abundance. Basically. Yes, we've managed to get to a world of abundance. And now it's created abundance level challenges. We got communications abundance. It created a mental health crisis, right? And we got, you know, XY, and Z. We've got food abundance, in a sense, and it's created abundance of obesity. Those problems are coming up and up and up. The solutions are all10800:15:16.120 --> 00:15:45.061The Alliance: cooperation at scale. How do we learn as a society to cooperate at scale planetary scale, even like bigger than tribal, bigger than you know what I mean. Those are all the challenges. So when I listen to you talking, I'm thinking this is cool and very, very, very relevant, going forward at A at A at a much bigger level, because I think all the challenges that are ahead of us. You know the grand challenges that you and I are both interested in solving climate crisis. Things like that10900:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.590The Alliance: are tied that way.11000:15:48.590 --> 00:15:55.132brian camastral: Yeah. So you mentioned so you took away that I made a comment about coaching being the sweet spot.11100:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.500brian camastral: I think coaching is the easiest way for me to start.11200:15:59.680 --> 00:16:06.989brian camastral: I don't think it's the sweet spot, though I think the sweet spot is some innovated, innovative11300:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.359brian camastral: group collaborating to do. What's11400:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.219brian camastral: what one person can't do alone11500:16:15.410 --> 00:16:22.020brian camastral: with me playing the role in that group where I'm harnessing my superpowers.11600:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.119brian camastral: I don't have to lead it.11700:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.270brian camastral: I can lead it11800:16:26.660 --> 00:16:33.550brian camastral: right. But I'm not attached to the leadership I'm attached to the group, making the difference in the world it's capable of making.11900:16:33.830 --> 00:16:50.500brian camastral: So at my age, you know. One way I might think about it is, I can front and lead something in the beginning. But what would really be cool is, there's a, you know, is eventually Ccl. Talks about how leaders 1st12000:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.129brian camastral: practice behavior of dominating the people they're leading.12100:16:54.410 --> 00:17:06.920brian camastral: and then they quickly learn that in scale that doesn't work, because right? So you lead, you lead through influence. And most people never outgrow that. But eventually there's a new level they call making sense of things.12200:17:07.119 --> 00:17:13.569brian camastral: And when you, it's terrifying. When I went, I experimented with that because basically, you give away all your power12300:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.219brian camastral: because you're confident you have a place that nobody else can occupy.12400:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.310brian camastral: and you're the holder of the vision and the culture.12500:17:23.480 --> 00:17:48.249brian camastral: And when these people, you've given all away your power away to run into challenges. They just come back to you, and you just make sense of things. It doesn't mean you have all the answers, but you're able to make sense of things in a way to bring them back so they can see the strategic pathway through the next 1, 2, and 3 steps. So they walk away and do their magic again.12600:17:48.480 --> 00:17:57.625brian camastral: And when I moved to that level of leadership I was like I was the best job I ever had in my life. It's like, Wow, I get to12700:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.930brian camastral: co-create the vision.12800:18:00.850 --> 00:18:08.820brian camastral: We co-created the protocols and behaviors that we would. We would have the container used to operate.12900:18:08.940 --> 00:18:26.200brian camastral: and by creating that container we made possible group flow that delivered outcomes beyond anything you could reasonably say is, you're going to chase. It's just like we took the market cap of Mars from 18 billion to 90 billion in 7 years.13000:18:26.590 --> 00:18:40.190brian camastral: It's like holy shit who that that is just extraordinary. But then there's other layers here, anyway. So I'm I'm talking too much, but I think my sweet spot is imagining my myself in13100:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.099brian camastral: to this collaborative effort13200:18:43.460 --> 00:18:52.179brian camastral: somehow, so that it's not just me doing my best work. But it's it's harnessing the best work of the group that's in this collaborative.13300:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.850brian camastral: That organization.13400:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.390The Alliance: 2 questions.13500:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.980brian camastral: Yes.13600:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.370The Alliance: Question one, what do you want? The collaboration to be aimed at?13700:19:01.540 --> 00:19:08.899The Alliance: What's the what's the what? What's the I'm not even. What's the vector of the collective ambition, even not even the the aim. And 2.13800:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.439The Alliance: It strikes me that13900:19:13.800 --> 00:19:35.829The Alliance: you have the kind of rolodex at this point, that if we 4 months from now you could come out, you know, you could. You could probably make a bunch of phone calls to a bunch of leaders of organizations. And I'm putting together a group of 10 people who are leading big organizations that I want to blah blah like that seems like something that you might be able to attract14000:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.750The Alliance: attention towards.14100:19:39.000 --> 00:20:07.799The Alliance: I don't know how much income you need it to generate, or any of that stuff, but it does strike me that that might be your rolodex in your in a way, you know, I'm a big believer with you is I want to start by starting so like, if you're saying it's gonna start with coaching. And I I get how it functions this way. Okay, cool. Then let's find like a small trial group of right whatever to start with. Would you know? I, I think, is what you're saying to me, did I? Am I misinterpreting what you're saying?14200:20:07.800 --> 00:20:16.309brian camastral: I just want to be back in the game, and so if I'm coaching a couple like I just took an old CEO client said, Hey, you seem like you.14300:20:16.430 --> 00:20:31.270brian camastral: you know something's missing. How about if I coach you free for the next few months? Because I'm restarting my coaching business, and I said, when I fill up my calendar with paying clients, I won't coach it free anymore. But you know you know I can.14400:20:32.290 --> 00:20:38.979brian camastral: I'd love love to help you if you think that would benefit. He jumped at it. I had my 1st call with him, and14500:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.830brian camastral: 70 min to to get going on that. So.14600:20:43.136 --> 00:20:43.749The Alliance: So great.14700:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.100brian camastral: Yeah.14800:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.969The Alliance: That's cool.14900:20:44.970 --> 00:20:59.180brian camastral: You've planted a seed. I don't know quite what to do with it, but I love the idea to marinate and see what what I get pulled towards. On this, pulling out my rolodex, and and imagining something.15000:20:59.670 --> 00:21:06.380The Alliance: Start of the call. You said there were 3 big insights you talked about the 1st one and got off in goal setting. We've come to hear what were the other 2 insights.15100:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.890brian camastral: So the second is that you made the comment that psychology is unique.15200:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.070brian camastral: Right? So it's hard to leverage.15300:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.390brian camastral: Neuroscience is universal.15400:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.489brian camastral: It works on everybody. So my takeaway on that is, oh, like the 1st was, oh, shit.15500:21:23.130 --> 00:21:28.440brian camastral: you know, because I think one of my strengths.15600:21:28.560 --> 00:21:42.380brian camastral: possibly superpowers is my ability to see the hidden, unvoiced things that are obstacles and opportunities for people, and help them imagine their way into a15700:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.540brian camastral: a life purpose or a big, hairy, audacious goal, or or something rather quickly.15800:21:50.270 --> 00:22:02.780brian camastral: So I'm thinking. Shit. You know, that I thought that was my my magic. But I do get that's all custom, right? It's not the same for everybody. So then, when you made the comment about neuroscience is universal.15900:22:02.940 --> 00:22:13.390brian camastral: I'm thinking, okay, how do I up level my understanding and knowledge around this first, st16000:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.160brian camastral: so that I hack it for myself.16100:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.900brian camastral: Right? II16200:22:18.010 --> 00:22:27.660brian camastral: 1st experience it more. I mastered eventually, so I can do it at will. This you know to to a large extent. Second, how do I16300:22:28.170 --> 00:22:34.200brian camastral: understand it? Well enough to overcome objections from potential clients?16400:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.919brian camastral: Right? Because I am so sick of convinced trying to convince people about why, to do things that make a difference in the world.16500:22:41.110 --> 00:22:49.130brian camastral: And I I I banged my head against the wall for at least 20 years around the money conversation.16600:22:49.490 --> 00:22:56.829brian camastral: because some people just can't focus on anything other than money, and it's never been a driver for me, so I can't relate to it.16700:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.530brian camastral: I always believe the money will come if you do the right things.16800:23:01.480 --> 00:23:19.210brian camastral: and at some point you know how much money can you use? Right for successful people? Most of these people have enough money, and if they make a lot more it's not going to change their life. So how do I learn it? Well enough to overcome objections so that people can buy into a transformational process.16900:23:19.320 --> 00:23:27.929brian camastral: that they believe one will make them more money, maybe, but ultimately they'll they'll recognize that there's something so much more valuable17000:23:28.050 --> 00:23:34.479brian camastral: than the money, because and and then, 3, rd how to coach it.17100:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.810The Alliance: Let me ask, can I ask, can I interrupt you for half a second to ask you a question17200:23:38.328 --> 00:23:47.271The Alliance: the piece that you're talking about, which is sort of like, get the neuro education that you want. In a sense, and hack it for yourself, for others.17300:23:47.800 --> 00:23:54.884The Alliance: one. I'm you've I mean, you've read art of impossible. So so you want you want to go farther than the neuro in there.17400:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.042brian camastral: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I I wanna know it well enough. So that17500:23:59.690 --> 00:24:11.349brian camastral: When I became interested in in sustainability, I found that Cambridge had a business and environment program. So I went and attended it, and I read a shitload.17600:24:11.350 --> 00:24:19.430The Alliance: Okay, I'm gonna next book was your team flow. Yeah, this is this is17700:24:21.400 --> 00:24:39.559The Alliance: when I think about behavior, because we're really just talking about. How do you affect behavioral change like, for example, you were just talking about fucking hate the money conversation, and I get it right. I don't. I'm not fundamental. I I have your I share your belief, but I also know from an evolutionary perspective that we17800:24:39.560 --> 00:24:55.190The Alliance: process money fears in the same part of the brain that we process social fears and physical danger because we treat money as a foundational scarcity issue, and then it gets tied up with all kinds of shit in our childhood as well very often.17900:24:55.750 --> 00:25:17.489The Alliance: and makes it very complicated in a sense, sometimes. But so you're not really looking at money resistance. You're looking at basic fear like basic scarcity, fear and questions like that. That, said the place. Maybe to start, this is one of my favorite neurotox books, and it18000:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.450The Alliance: covers 3 things that I think are relevant here. One. I have a general belief that18100:25:22.760 --> 00:25:34.559The Alliance: if you want a decent understanding of something you really always have to understand a little bit the evolution of a thing, the evolutionary perspective where the fuck did it come from. So I want you to read Yoc, JAAK,18200:25:34.710 --> 00:25:46.259The Alliance: panxa, PANK. SEPP. And it's a textbook, but it's a very reader. Friendly textbook as far as they go which is called affective neuroscience.18300:25:46.590 --> 00:26:03.349The Alliance: This is the foundational textbook in the history of neuroscience for emotional neuroscience and behavioral neuroscience. And what Yoc discovered is that there are 7 foundational, emotional pathways in all mammals18400:26:03.651 --> 00:26:29.590The Alliance: and trace them. And it just gives you a really great understanding of the 7 basic neurobiological drivers of emotion and some of the neuroscience around it. I it's literally like, when people come to me, my staff. And they're like, Okay, it's time for me to really learn neuro and get one level better. I always start them there because I think it's a very 1st of all, it's not as long as some other stuff. And I think it's just very user friendly18500:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.620The Alliance: bum.18600:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.430brian camastral: Beautiful.18700:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.190The Alliance: You're in another. Another18800:26:34.190 --> 00:26:52.590The Alliance: really good resource for you is so. I love the Cambridge. This is a Cambridge series. The Cambridge Handbook of this is creativity that I'm holding in my hand, but they've got the Cambridge Handbook of Imagination, the Cambridge Handbook of18900:26:53.940 --> 00:27:13.679The Alliance: etc, etc. They tend to cover like they've got a bunch of good neural ones, and they like they're just primers, and they're huge. They're like a thousand pages. But once you're once you sort of digest one. They're very cool because they do 2 things that you can't get elsewhere. And I think they're gonna like, if you're gonna actually take the time to get educated. This is like.19000:27:13.720 --> 00:27:35.269The Alliance: get the evolution. So you can understand the backstory and then try to get a sense of the global picture. That's what the Cambridge books do. That other textbooks don't do. People will go out and find their friends, but in the Cambridge book they will find go across the top of the field on specific topics. So there's probably a Cambridge handbook of leadership or and and neuroscience or something along those lines. They're just really great resources.19100:27:35.804 --> 00:27:37.229The Alliance: To play with.19200:27:37.410 --> 00:27:49.200The Alliance: and the entire, the the flip side of that, if you've never seen this series is the Oxford very short introduction series.19300:27:49.760 --> 00:28:01.519The Alliance: and these are the I'm holding them a a very short introduction to Heidegger, but they have millions of them, and they're written by geniuses, and they're tiny. They're like a hundred pages long. So if you're just looking to like.19400:28:01.540 --> 00:28:29.839The Alliance: Hey, I'm curious about this. I want the next stuff of whatever these books are really cool. They're not. They're short. They're not easy. They're not like, they're not for dummies. They're really for fucking smart people who really like. Okay, I don't need a thousand pages here. But tell me that. Tell me what I need to know. That's another. I think cool resource that you might find valuable and and I will also do a I'm gonna do an introduction to to Michael Menino and ask him to spend half an hour with you on the call.19500:28:29.840 --> 00:28:52.840The Alliance: Just so you can sort of break you down like a little bit about what he's doing at Synergy, because it might like that might be an interesting tool in your kit, among other things, and I want you to get a sense of I'll tell him to just give you a sense of like what's going on the forefront of collaborative neuroscience. And you just tell him what you're interested in, and he can shoot you more papers than you would know what to fucking do with.19600:28:52.910 --> 00:28:59.890The Alliance: So we can. We can like one thing that we could do along the way for you a little bit is, just get you a good reading list. You know what I mean.19700:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.790brian camastral: Beautiful. That was one of my questions today. What should I read next?19800:29:03.790 --> 00:29:10.829The Alliance: Yeah, so team flow and affective neuroscience, I'm going to get you on a call with Menino. As soon as we hang up.19900:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.830brian camastral: Great. Okay, so.20000:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.850The Alliance: Number 3.20100:29:13.850 --> 00:29:23.424brian camastral: Yeah, so that that 3 well, my takeaway was participants seem amazing. I'm really excited. I feel like I have direction, right?20200:29:24.310 --> 00:29:30.710brian camastral: you know which we're. We're tightening the direction here. So I just saying, Thank you. I'm excited.20300:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.860brian camastral: really. Looking forward to it.20400:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.570brian camastral: I see all kinds of possibilities.20500:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.199The Alliance: I do, too. I do, too. I like my my big takeaway was20600:29:41.690 --> 00:29:56.990The Alliance: next time I do this I'm gonna take a bunch of things like the pasta explanation. I'm gonna pre record that I didn't want to pre record a bunch of stuff for you guys because I didn't. I couldn't quite tell. I wanted to see how things felt in the room and what felt ex, and I was like, you know what.20700:29:57.120 --> 00:30:19.870The Alliance: Toby loose sketch of a pasta some of the tools. I could just do 15 min videos that keep people watch before they start the exercise. They didn't. You don't need that. And I also thought I wanted to break it. Now I I see the format I was like. This has got to be a night before. Let's have dinner. Let's meet each other. Then let's do a data dump. And the data dump should be less data and more breakout. If I can do it next time, I think.20800:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.120brian camastral: I mean,20900:30:21.840 --> 00:30:32.269brian camastral: When I was doing the high performance team stuff, I learned a lot, tried a bunch of techniques. But Peter Block, if you ask him to introduce himself.21000:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.500brian camastral: he says, I'm a i'm a member of a group of 3,21100:30:37.310 --> 00:30:44.249brian camastral: that's all he says. Alright. So he's got this research about how you can take a 900 people in a room21200:30:44.550 --> 00:30:53.179brian camastral: and break them into groups of 3 for 15 min, and after 15 you ask them 3 each 3 questions, at what crossroads are you in your life?21300:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.460brian camastral: What doubts do you have?21400:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.230brian camastral: What excites you?21500:30:58.450 --> 00:31:08.549brian camastral: Right? And in 15 min each of these person will have shared this, and then he can ask for, like another 15 min, any big takeaways to the group.21600:31:08.680 --> 00:31:33.209brian camastral: But then in 30 min the entire group is connected, and you've created a safe container, because in the little groups you've done these like vulnerable shares. But it's only with 2 other people. But the energetic in the room just pulls everybody together, and that extrapolates the safe container. So when we did high performance teamwork.21700:31:33.710 --> 00:31:37.989brian camastral: what I would always do is, there was a little teaching on concepts.21800:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.530brian camastral: but the vast majority of the time was taking the biggest, gnarliest problem we had.21900:31:43.720 --> 00:32:01.780brian camastral: and using the principles to work on the gnarly problem, but from a different perspective. So boom! It was like, if we took 2 days for this training, we might solve one or 2 gnarly problems, or at least get a plan for how to solve them. So it wasn't time away from work.22000:32:02.040 --> 00:32:09.910brian camastral: It was just the opposite that it was doing the most critical work that needed to be done in a way that was like putting it on steroids.22100:32:10.060 --> 00:32:16.210brian camastral: So I'm imagining here you're learning your way in to those dynamics with this group.22200:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.009brian camastral: What's the right level of interaction on what22300:32:20.130 --> 00:32:27.970brian camastral: to, you know, amplify and accelerate what's possible with us collaborating together. I don't know what to do with that.22400:32:27.970 --> 00:32:33.030The Alliance: Like. The. By the way, that's that's I think that's I. I sort of like what you gave me actually is a22500:32:34.350 --> 00:32:55.199The Alliance: is perfect because it I. What I want to do is some kind of like wick and dirty stand around a circle, ever be introduced before dinner on the like Welcome night, and then send everybody into groups. Let them do something, have a group discussion, and then we have dinner and like. Then the the next day is the data dump and22600:32:58.850 --> 00:33:07.240The Alliance: it's also, you know, it's interesting. The other question is, how much flow stuff do people need? Because those you know what I mean. Some of it's very remedial. If you know my work.22700:33:07.840 --> 00:33:16.700The Alliance: Interesting questions, so we'll I'll I'll have better answers. After you know. I talked to talk to everybody as we go along. I'm really excited, though. I like where we're at.22800:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.270brian camastral: What I love.22900:33:17.270 --> 00:33:17.650The Alliance: Let's get.23000:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.020brian camastral: What! What I love.23100:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.579The Alliance: Do we do together.23200:33:19.580 --> 00:33:25.430brian camastral: Is your you're you're evolving always. You're not trying to tell people23300:33:25.620 --> 00:33:34.040brian camastral: the same static solution that you knew 3 years ago. You know, every time you're talking about this, it's the the cutting edge version of it.23400:33:34.200 --> 00:33:47.729brian camastral: right, which is very rare for people that are trying to make a buck. They get a mousetrap that works well enough. So they just spin that hamster wheel, and they never improve the damn mousetrap, and then it just drives me nuts, anyway.23500:33:47.730 --> 00:34:12.190The Alliance: By the way, I will. So I, by the way, I agree with you completely. Same thing. I think, always said that I think this is a like a weird advantage, but but like so you talked about some of your superpowers when I was 1st starting my career as a journalist, right, and it became very clear to me that like, Oh, you have to have a beat. There's shit you got to cover right, and my interests were everywhere, but I didn't have like a vertical. I had a horizontal.23600:34:12.190 --> 00:34:20.769The Alliance: The cutting edge was my horizontal right. There were some people who could crawl through the numbers there was like, I am really naturally good23700:34:20.790 --> 00:34:41.769The Alliance: at. Where is the cutting edge? Where's the bullshit like? Where's the line? Where's the bullshit? What's right on the edge of the line. And who's there who's legit and not a marketer? Because there's you'll get both right, and you have to be able to sift through those things. And I developed. Really, I've got good instincts for finding the cutting edge. And I developed23800:34:42.080 --> 00:34:55.620The Alliance: getting my ass kicked a lot really good instincts, for like, how do I know if somebody's lying, or even if they don't quite know their idea yet, like they, they think it's a great idea, but it's not really yet, and they're just.23900:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.290brian camastral: Right.24000:34:57.410 --> 00:35:02.006The Alliance: These are the same, the same tells. And all of us what24100:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.810The Alliance: We've got another 25 min. What can we rapid fire through for you?24200:35:07.810 --> 00:35:14.499brian camastral: Yeah. So I had 6 questions after the 3 takeaways. One was how to up level neuroscience we've covered that24300:35:15.140 --> 00:35:21.550brian camastral: 2 was how to think about process versus outcome when I'm working with goal stacking.24400:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.669brian camastral: Okay? So when I when I asked that question.24500:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.239brian camastral: what comes to mind is in our country?24600:35:30.004 --> 00:35:40.849brian camastral: You know I haven't had time to go back and pull, extract my takeaways so that I internalize the principles here. But what I think you laid out24700:35:41.200 --> 00:35:51.129brian camastral: is that you had a combination of process goals and outcome goals. You had your I don't know 30 list of 33 particular ski.24800:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.590brian camastral: part maneuvers you wanted to accomplish.24900:35:55.910 --> 00:36:12.680brian camastral: But you had your process goals of how many laps you were going to do like on the day where you didn't feel it. The thing that you you kept vaulting you forward, or maybe it was inching you forward was that you stuck to the process, and you kept your promise to do whatever number of laps you did25000:36:13.250 --> 00:36:18.040brian camastral: so, imagining that that's25100:36:18.320 --> 00:36:26.019brian camastral: the trick I have to solve for myself. With my goal stack is identify the process that's going to keep me moving forward25200:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.889brian camastral: and allow me25300:36:28.860 --> 00:36:41.229brian camastral: to be in that that space between attachment and detachment, maybe call non-attachment, that the outcomes matter, and I do want to achieve them, but that I don't give them control over my life.25400:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.980brian camastral: What I let control is sticking to the process.25500:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.689brian camastral: So now that I've blabbed for a minute, I I.25600:36:48.690 --> 00:36:54.739The Alliance: I think you're exactly right. The way I think about it is, let me just give it. Let me get a books, a really easy example.25700:36:56.010 --> 00:37:05.063The Alliance: A book will get done when it gets done, like I want to write a book on intuition next, right? Like, that's the next. When I finish this couple of things I'm doing. It's going into a book on intuition.25800:37:05.310 --> 00:37:34.439The Alliance: I have some really big dreams for this book. A lot of people believe it could fetch a tremendously large advance, and I have a goal there that I've wanted to hit for a long time, and a lot of people think it could be my shot at winning a bunch like actually winning the Pulitzer. You know what I mean a lot of this stuff that I've been nominated for and haven't won so there's a lot of like my agent wants to do it because he wants the money and blah blah, and there's a lot of like external pressure internal pressure. Whatever the truth of the matter is.25900:37:36.900 --> 00:37:43.249The Alliance: the only way to get wherever is to say, Nope, I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna in in26000:37:43.340 --> 00:38:11.780The Alliance: July. I will start working on the proposal because the 2 but 3 books I'm working on now will be done, and I'll start working on the proposal, and then it's literally 500 words a day, 500 words a day for the proposal, and the proposal takes literally as long as it takes, because I've learned that every day or week of patience tends to add up to more zeros so like, and once the book sells. It's 500 pages a day, and I don't care how long it takes. You know what I like, and26100:38:11.780 --> 00:38:41.190The Alliance: I don't care how it's going to do ultimately, because I believe that it doesn't like it's going to be a it's it's not. It's not the destination. It's just another step, right like I've written a lot of 17 books. No book is the destination. It's just another step. So I'm either going to hit my goal, exceed my goals or miss my goals, but it doesn't really matter, because the journey is towards. I want to be the best author in the history of the universe, and I don't get to be that without just continuously switch taking a swing26200:38:41.190 --> 00:38:53.850The Alliance: and another swing and another swing. And that's how I think about it. In our country the same thing, too, and in our country was really about survival. Because I have learned, if you go to the fucking mountain saying, today I am going to jump that cliff26300:38:54.040 --> 00:39:21.920The Alliance: and you don't have it. You're going to the hospital right? And and you're gonna be scared all day all day. You're gonna be thinking about. I gotta jump that cliff. I gotta jump that cliff. I gotta jump that cliff rather than getting to the point where you're like. Oh, I feel really good. Now I should jump that cliff. So I know I have to do all these things over the course of a season. Which ones I do today open question because I gotta like my bones are on the line. So I gotta like, I gotta preserve my body over the long haul. That's sort of is that helpful.26400:39:22.110 --> 00:39:30.600brian camastral: I love it. Yeah. So I just need to figure out some process metrics that that keep me moving forward and fuel me.26500:39:30.970 --> 00:39:40.319The Alliance: It is we it is the money. The money question is interesting. The bottom line question is interesting for companies, and I always just like26600:39:40.780 --> 00:39:50.680The Alliance: to me. It's the hardest thing to do in any organization, maybe even in the human brain, is I like to set 2 year goals. I think that's helpful.26700:39:50.800 --> 00:40:09.330The Alliance: Great time horizon for thinking into the future. And you're not getting over your skis in a way where there's no fucking way. You could see what's going on, especially in this era of AI. I don't think you could see beyond 2 years in any real realistic way yet. So I'm like, what's how do I think about 2 years from now? And you know, if I have26800:40:09.940 --> 00:40:39.879The Alliance: a 10 year goal right to win a Nobel Prize for flow research like what? That's not. I mean, that's sort of a light, loose sort of goal that I sort of poke out. I don't actually know if I really care enough to like. I know what it would take to do that, and I could probably aim. I don't know if I could do that. But I could definitely aim in that direction. I just don't know if I have that kind of energy. If I had a hundred person team I'd like whatever. But like, really, do I really care that much like that's sort of an ego goal.26900:40:40.300 --> 00:40:48.669brian camastral: I totally get relate to all of this, but it's about the energy thing. So I feel like I'm on a journey that will take the rest of my this lifetime.27000:40:49.283 --> 00:40:52.649brian camastral: And that's if I'm on the right passion journey.27100:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.860brian camastral: I'm gonna feel like I'm playing for the rest of my life.27200:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.420brian camastral: Right? So of course, there's some outcomes I'd like, but27300:41:00.921 --> 00:41:09.009brian camastral: but it, the process of enjoying it and finding fulfillment each day, you know, is with the real goal. And if I can27400:41:09.270 --> 00:41:19.519brian camastral: accomplish something that makes the world better, all the better. But okay, I'm gonna keep going. So on this goal stack thing. Let me see, I think I got what I.27500:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.989The Alliance: 3 on your question list.27600:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.959brian camastral: Yeah. So 3. So I think27700:41:24.210 --> 00:41:38.860brian camastral: I wanted to then pause when we're warmed up a little because I got those key insights from you, but we're in your wheelhouse, so you might actually have another insight. You haven't shared yet. But and if you don't, I'll just go on. So is.27800:41:38.860 --> 00:41:44.499The Alliance: Keep going on, and let me let me do that at the end. Great! That's a great question. That's a really good question. But keep going on.27900:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.359brian camastral: Yeah. And then 4 is about the role of money. I think we've covered that 5th was28000:41:51.613 --> 00:41:53.199brian camastral: recommendations about28100:41:55.230 --> 00:42:08.409brian camastral: learn. So learn. So up leveling my neuroscience A was, we got levels of neurobiology we've got. And then the 3rd was, you said, ask if you're interested in mystical experiences.28200:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.670brian camastral: So I.28300:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.990The Alliance: I am.28400:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.889brian camastral: Imagine that in this collective flow world28500:42:15.460 --> 00:42:25.309brian camastral: there's there's something about mystical experiences that is magical, that it just. It just takes it. It transcends to a different place.28600:42:25.510 --> 00:42:30.910brian camastral: and it might not be the time to to poke at that. But at at some point28700:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.049brian camastral: there it might make sense.28800:42:33.050 --> 00:42:57.409The Alliance: So no, there's there's there's plenty here, and let me give you some resources along the way. So one funny thing you may not have ever heard me say this, but flow research actually gets started in the late 18th century and one of the niches there first, st along with a couple other people and what they're trying Goethe coins the term flow.28900:42:57.740 --> 00:43:23.549The Alliance: and it means overflowing with joy, and he coins the term the German word for it. Rausch, and he coins the term because he's trying to solve a puzzle, which is what the fuck happens to human beings at Oktoberfest festivals. People go to these beer festivals, and there's so that's where the early work on what is now known as communitas, which is group flow at scale like you scale political rallies. But I'd like if to me29000:43:23.600 --> 00:43:47.370The Alliance: I don't know if you've ever had this experience. But, like every time I really I go to a concert, and it really clicks a big concert where you're like one with the band, one with the crowd and everybody's clapping and sick. And it's really that collective feeling that's communitas. But like it's an amazing, delicious feeling. You know what I mean. I like. I've still got a couple of like musical events in my head. Tom waits radio and a couple of things where I'm just like, Wow! That was one of the most29100:43:47.530 --> 00:44:08.010The Alliance: our things ever and you. Then you can see the dark side. In my opinion, Tony Roberts. Robin's advances are the dark side, and I'm not saying he doesn't try to uplift people. But he uses Altic programming techniques. We're gonna keep you up all night. We're not going to give you a schedule. We're not going to feed you regularly keep the air really, really cold. I'm gonna29200:44:08.130 --> 00:44:32.509The Alliance: try to like, do these demonstrative transform experiences, like people are speaking in tongues. Only there, you know what I mean like, oh, that's all cultic programming from the, you know sixties. And you know, even George or Orwell talked about how to. You know that 1984 was about how to do how to do that stuff. And it was based on techniques from the thirties. So we've seen both sides of it. But they're very powerful tools. So so that is true. And29300:44:32.790 --> 00:44:44.090The Alliance: the neurobiology of spiritual experience, the neurosensic experience, the best guy in that at that at the level you're interested in. Sort of. It's not really collective, but it'll give you a way to start thinking about some of this stuff.29400:44:44.870 --> 00:44:51.170The Alliance: I mean. I, you know, West of Jesus. I sort of cover high level, but it's my mentor, Dr. Andrew Newberg, who's written29500:44:51.320 --> 00:45:14.388The Alliance: a Zillion books on all the different, you know his 1st one. Why, God won't go away is really, you know, that's just a really cool introduction in the narrow side. Statistical experiences back where we were at 99, like, you know, 20 years ago, when I 1st met Andrew. But he's written like 4 or 5 other books since then that are all really sort of cool on that stuff, and29600:45:16.230 --> 00:45:22.235The Alliance: the money thing. By the way, I don't know if this is going to help you or not, but since you're a reader, I'll throw it out there.29700:45:22.750 --> 00:45:27.999The Alliance: My friend Scott Berry Kaufman has a, he wrote, transcend, which is sort of the29800:45:28.130 --> 00:45:37.090The Alliance: Bible on Maslow's thinking, but he wrote a follow up book that just came out. Where is it? So I can get the title right? Well, I think it's called29900:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.960The Alliance: what did he call it? Oh.30000:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.710The Alliance: God damn it, Scott! Where did I put your book.30100:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.755brian camastral: This is what happens when you have too many books in your brain. Hold on.30200:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.459brian camastral: Yeah, I just. I've twice given away about a thousand books it just was painful to do, but.30300:45:58.360 --> 00:46:08.440The Alliance: Yeah. By the way, I don't have many regrets. The couple of times I've given away my books have been. When I. Those are regrets. I should never have done that.30400:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.809The Alliance: Oh, rise above. I'm sorry it's called. Rise above.30500:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.710The Alliance: Hello!30600:46:18.630 --> 00:46:22.620The Alliance: Right, Brian.30700:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.410The Alliance: Hello!30800:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.500The Alliance: You just vanished.30900:47:21.060 --> 00:47:28.630The Alliance: Oh, okay, yep, we do let me.31000:47:28.780 --> 00:47:35.839The Alliance: Oh, oh, Scott! Barry Kaufman wrote a book called Rot Rise Above.31100:47:36.040 --> 00:47:45.860The Alliance: And it's really it's really about like today's sort of culture of victimhood, and but he has some really interesting things to say about31200:47:46.010 --> 00:48:10.249The Alliance: vulnerable narcissists. And it's really I'm not applying this to you at all. But what I was thinking is some of what you talked about with the money problem and talking to other people about. It seems to be folded into some of that stuff that Scott talks about. I don't know if it's gonna be helpful at all. It's a very cool book. It's worth reading. It's psychology more than neuroscience, though he does know his neuroscience.31300:48:10.250 --> 00:48:25.129The Alliance: And if you actually want to know the neuroscience of his psychology, he did our podcast and I asked him to break down the neuroscience. He yelled at me. He's like, why do you always want the neuroscience? You should trust the psychology? He gave me the neuroscience.31400:48:27.640 --> 00:48:46.549The Alliance: No, no, the book is called Rise Above. And it's really about an anecdote to victim the sort of the victimization culture and a lot of stuff going on today, but it's got some sections in there, and he doesn't directly tie it to money issues. I just as you were talking. I was like, God! That sounds a little bit like some of the stuff Scott was seeing31500:48:46.690 --> 00:48:55.309The Alliance: just, you know, just not applied to money when we can ask Scott when we're when we're with him later on in the year. But you might want to check out that book, too, since I can load you up.31600:49:36.860 --> 00:49:47.339The Alliance: That is totally fascinating. I want to hear more. Let's not do it. Now let's go through the rest of your questions. But let's let's revisit this when we when we have an alcoholic beverage in front of us, or or something like that.31700:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.490The Alliance: hit me.31800:50:00.940 --> 00:50:19.029The Alliance: Oh, I said, it's hard to train mindset and train down bias. Those are the goals eventually over time. But you have to start with reframing, and gratitude is one of the more powerful reframing techniques. If you're up against fear.31900:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.870The Alliance: Yes, sir.32000:50:57.270 --> 00:51:16.049The Alliance: oh, so adaptive flexibility comes out of resilience training, and the best book to read is my friend George Bonanno's book. He's a clinical psychologist at Columbia University. His great book is the end of trauma.32100:51:16.210 --> 00:51:24.820The Alliance: It's phenomenal phenomenal. And so remember, I I got I got really mad about Russ vessel Vanderpolk, and the body keeps the score.32200:51:25.240 --> 00:51:32.009The Alliance: And the reason I'm so mad about that is because he took George's research32300:51:32.150 --> 00:51:42.879The Alliance: and inverted it so much and corrupted us. That's what he's using in his book to sort of justify a lot of his claims. George's studies on sexual trauma, and he literally like32400:51:43.670 --> 00:52:07.290The Alliance: made them up George read Bessel's book and was like, What is this study on sexual trauma that's so fascinating. I've never heard anything like it totally contradicts my study and went to the footnotes and realized George was quoting his study, and it totally screwed up the results. So. But George is so, George is basically we, George and I agree, and it's very hard to train adaptive flexibility. So, for example.32500:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.630The Alliance: we know meditation32600:52:10.910 --> 00:52:27.170The Alliance: calms you down, and should make you more adaptively flexible right? Like it's a it's a component. And and so theoretically training a company to meditate should produce more adaptive flexibility. Work more resilience. Excuse me right? And it doesn't.32700:52:27.210 --> 00:52:46.180The Alliance: And the reason is, meditation is a phenomenal tool up until the point. Your nervous system is completely jacked, and then, when you try to focus on your breath. All you think about is the things you're panicking about. And it actually makes the problem worse. There's no one blanket tool that works in every situation except flow training.32800:52:46.200 --> 00:53:07.510The Alliance: He, we've agreed on this flow. Training is the only thing you can train that actually makes you more adaptive. Be flexible because it's actually what's underneath adaptive flexibility. But anyways, his great book on the research is called the End of Trauma. It's phenomenal. We also did a podcast with George. That's also really quite good. If you don't want to take all the time to read the book.32900:53:13.780 --> 00:53:21.000The Alliance: So if yeah, like, I, okay. So I let me get to do this, menino, banana, podcast.33000:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.640The Alliance: Okay. So this actually brings us33100:53:49.780 --> 00:53:58.600The Alliance: to is there anything? I should have told you guys about that. I forgot to tell you, or I didn't have time to tell you or blah blah. And the answer, this33200:53:58.950 --> 00:54:22.219The Alliance: the answer is what you just said, and I I did realize afterwards I was like, you know, there was one thing I should have said, and I forgot to say it. And I didn't even see it till the end. And it's actually like, I always it's it's where I think flow training has to start which is. And it doesn't seem like this is a problem for you. But I just wanna mention the concepts you can understand. It.33300:54:22.580 --> 00:54:30.199The Alliance: Flow is like creativity is promiscuous flows, promiscuous, just training it in one category33400:54:30.370 --> 00:54:39.999The Alliance: trains multiple categories. So my point is, if I go skiing on Sunday, I'm training up a very particular kind of focus if I got into flow flow that will translate33500:54:40.870 --> 00:55:10.789The Alliance: on Tuesday, when I sit down to write, it's not quite as promiscuous as creativity. It's a longer translation process, basically. And I think what I think, what I mean by that is, you have to be in creativity will starts working almost dramatically flow. I think you have to start really getting good at it in certain areas before it starts really leaking to the others. But there's something known as a primary flow activity. This is literally what you've done. Whatever you've done your whole life to get you into flow for you. It sounds like33600:55:10.970 --> 00:55:19.250The Alliance: challenging endurance activities biking across America. Pardon me, you?33700:55:20.270 --> 00:55:26.630The Alliance: Oh, okay, so, oh, yeah, okay, so that's even like, so my point is, when we tend to get33800:55:27.030 --> 00:55:54.750The Alliance: adulty right and busy, and especially stressed out over problems we need to solve in our lives. We tend to walk away. And ha! Oh, I don't have time to play basketball, or I don't have time to go skiing the truth of the matter is, it should be your 1st priority. I tell people that when they make like weekly clear goals lists.
