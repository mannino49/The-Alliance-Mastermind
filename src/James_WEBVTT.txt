WEBVTT100:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.520The Alliance: How are you, hey? To see you?200:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.440The Alliance: How you doing.300:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.769James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You too good.400:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.120The Alliance: Excellent.500:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.758The Alliance: Let's dive in because we have a limited time. I wanna maximize place to start for me was600:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.129The Alliance: One of the reasons I like the fire hose approach700:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.599The Alliance: is due to like initial learning is it's really crucial.800:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.150The Alliance: Couple weeks out to figure out what stuck like, what really landed with you what's led to kind of insight and change.900:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.910The Alliance: and then we'll jump into where you're stuck, where your block, how we can, how we can sort of1000:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.699The Alliance: master out a plan to go forward.1100:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.495James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.1200:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Oh, one.1300:01:42.970 --> 00:01:52.659The Alliance: What? What really stuck with you? What what were actual insights were fun? Where was there a lot of resistance? If there was, you know any of the any of the cool stuff.1400:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.525James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.1500:01:54.498 --> 00:02:03.090James Crowe/Vanderbilt: yeah, I've wrestled a lot with it. And I think one of the things is my chronotype and your chronotypes a little bit different. So1600:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.139James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I typically, I'm gonna run in the morning and1700:02:08.310 --> 00:02:25.090James Crowe/Vanderbilt: maybe meditate, maybe read. I I just don't get up and kill it in the morning, but if I were left to my own dessert, which sometimes I am, if I travel with my wife's not here, I can kill it from 10 Pm. To 3 30, Am. I mean? That is just like my sweet spot.1800:02:25.390 --> 00:02:37.639James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Now, currently, I don't do that because I'm accommodating to you know my marriage. But just the you know, 3 30 in the morning is not so. I'm I'm sort of like juggling with this. Your schedule, these of you know. Are you.1900:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.119The Alliance: Good news. So you got, yeah, you guys, this I said this and you're the second. I didn't. Maybe I didn't make it clear enough. Only time my schedule doesn't apply2000:02:46.500 --> 00:03:14.900The Alliance: is if your Chronotype is different, right? You can't. Then you can't. Do. You know, then you shouldn't do my deep work session in the morning. You you need to put your deep work session at the start of when you're at maximum energy. If you can. You're balancing your your life and wife so like, you know, we can maybe figure that out, but really don't. No, no, this is what I meant, but make it. Your own, like my chronotype, is my chronotype. Don't like you can't fight that. I said so. I said, my wife is a night owl, right?2100:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.769James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.2200:03:15.770 --> 00:03:27.840The Alliance: Can't match under that. So that like that's definitely don't try to fight for that. We might have to figure out how to get like how you can stay up later and still have a marriage. That's a different question. Maybe right?2300:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.430James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah, well, we'll get to that. So2400:03:31.921 --> 00:03:40.890James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and in fact, I think a lot of the stuff, a lot of the principles you're talking about. I'm actually pretty good on. So I've been working with a mindfulness coach for2500:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: 5 or 6 years. I use2600:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.039James Crowe/Vanderbilt: headspace. I meet with the guy, you know, an hour a week and do breathing.2700:03:49.016 --> 00:03:54.820James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's like the, you know. I do a lot of that kind of thing already.2800:03:55.331 --> 00:04:04.049James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And then my running. I run a lot. You know I'm I'm in and out of these 150 mile desert races, which itself is pretty meditative.2900:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.035James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And3000:04:10.020 --> 00:04:20.760James Crowe/Vanderbilt: yeah, I don't do as many sort of creative, generative, creative things. I so I you know, I'm obsessed with art. And I I probably spend more time reading about art.3100:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.469James Crowe/Vanderbilt: collecting art, you know, going to museums and seeing art that I do working sort of, I mean, in terms of intellectual investment.3200:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.940James Crowe/Vanderbilt: even though it's not my job. It's just something3300:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.989James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm kind of obsessed with. So I I am in a creative mode.3400:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.800James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But I'm generally not, you know, doing it with my hands, and I think that's something I want to do more of. I think3500:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, the micro dosing is an interesting idea, and when I do some of that, I think.3600:04:49.210 --> 00:04:59.949The Alliance: So so you haven't really you really you have. You've stuck with your meditation, you you haven't done the Vipassana and you haven't really tried the creative Microdosing. Yet am I.3700:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.700James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, I did. No, I did. I have. I have done all that, in fact.3800:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.260James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, you know, the week after I was with you. I went to a workshop in Greece3900:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.769James Crowe/Vanderbilt: which is with Marina Abramovic. I don't know if you ever heard of her, but she's the most important performance artist of the last 100 years.4000:05:17.100 --> 00:05:45.669James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So she used her body to do performance. If anybody's ever heard of her, she did. A movie called The Artist is present where she sat in Moma for her. It was her retrospective, her life retrospective. But she sat in Moma for 6 weeks, a chair, you know, in a chair, and the public could come and sit for as long as they wanted, and just gaze with her, and she was present. So she has a workshop to teach long duration performance. I went to it, you know, a week ago. So fasting silent.4100:05:46.190 --> 00:05:54.540James Crowe/Vanderbilt: no reading, no electronics for a week in a group setting, and they run you through these exercises like4200:05:54.910 --> 00:06:11.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: counting lentils and rice for 6 h and things like that. So I mean, I just did, you know, and very intensive fasting, silent, staring at primary colors for an hour at a time, each color this sort of thing. So4300:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.980James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, I I already kinda do woo stuff like that. And then I I just did that for a week.4400:06:16.980 --> 00:06:40.070The Alliance: The only reason. The only reason I'm interested in this particular proposana exercise is, it's not the woo woo. It's that I'm trying to get people to get as much visibility of their unconscious processes as possible. And that's what it? That's what it does really. Well, if you're doing that already. Cool. Not worried about it right? If that.4500:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.440James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah.4600:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.670The Alliance: Checked for you. That's excellent. Then we don't have to focus there at all.4700:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.890James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I I think I think I do. I'm you know. I know thoughts, emotions, sensations, perceptions, noting4800:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.000James Crowe/Vanderbilt: back to the breath. I'm not saying I'm a you know.4900:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.210The Alliance: Doing that stuff, then. Great! I don't like cool. Keep doing it. Use mine. Use yours. I don't care.5000:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.670James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, you're.5100:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.879The Alliance: Care that you're getting a daily recovery. Activity that could reset your nervous system is what I care about.5200:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.340James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah.5300:07:11.340 --> 00:07:32.650The Alliance: I like this 1st of the possible meditation, because most like the general reaction in the group, has been overwhelmingly positive, because most of them are used to. Not somebody convinced people somewhere along the way that if somebody talks straight through your guided meditation that's actually meditating, it's not you're listening to a lecture5400:07:33.380 --> 00:07:57.020The Alliance: breathing. But you're listening to a lecture. You're not like the part of you that needs to go off is not going off. The most people who've been doing that like find the learning about like what's going on inside. That's what I care about right recovery and see what's going on internally. So you can course, correct and really get it. Mostly get in there and and fuck with your frames right? Which is what unlocks the most creativity.5500:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.555James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah,5600:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.429James Crowe/Vanderbilt: so well, I could say more, but I I guess to get to the thing that I'm most wrestling with. I think.5700:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.120The Alliance: Yeah, tell me what you're most stressful.5800:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I gave it to you in my like. My intake stuff, too, is5900:08:14.113 --> 00:08:30.540James Crowe/Vanderbilt: so I have a lot of stuff going on. I have an academic center with 50 people. It's 150 million dollar enterprise. It's all you know. Nih, Dod funded biotech research. And I have a spin out company. That's even in clinical trials. And I have a nonprofit trying to raise 2 billion dollars.6000:08:31.484 --> 00:08:38.229James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And you know, I'm busy. I'm running. I'm doing strength training. I'm studying art.6100:08:39.799 --> 00:08:45.859James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So I do have this desire that we talked about this brain desire for novelty.6200:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.510James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And so6300:08:47.700 --> 00:09:05.140James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm always kind of looking to new things like, I'm starting a new project in my lab around ancient DNA, studying mummies. This is incredibly hard. Go around the world, get the mummy tissues bring them in. I got to build a clean room lab, so a high complexity, novel, academic thing.6400:09:05.490 --> 00:09:14.170James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and then that the novelty leads to travel. I like to travel. Usually I'm like going someplace to run in a desert or a mountain or something, but still it's6500:09:14.420 --> 00:09:35.840James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, it's travel and culture. So I like this novelty, but the goals that I have like to make a hundred drugs and get them out there over time. It's like an operational, detailed, logistical project management, and I have delegated quite well. I have, you know, a bunch of people that work for me, but I'm sort of struggling between6600:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: a lot of what we talked about at the the, you know, opening6700:09:41.310 --> 00:09:52.179James Crowe/Vanderbilt: thing in Tahoe was sort of opening up to ideas, creativity, and flow states. And yet a lot of time I have to be in operational detail, or my group sort of6800:09:52.360 --> 00:10:01.329James Crowe/Vanderbilt: closed down. I mean, I can't just ignore them. So toggling between, you know my desire for novelty, creativity, new ideas.6900:10:01.620 --> 00:10:08.289James Crowe/Vanderbilt: writing myself versus like pushing this difficult rock up the hill.7000:10:08.500 --> 00:10:17.690James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And just one more thing about that, like the Federal Government is nuts right now in my area, they're specifically canceling infectious disease, research and7100:10:17.890 --> 00:10:27.239James Crowe/Vanderbilt: billions of dollars of grants and threatening universities and threatening pharma. So the headwinds against what I'm trying to do are extremely stiff right now, and the whole thing could fail.7200:10:27.490 --> 00:10:32.460James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and I might have to fire everybody. So I have to pay attention, you know, to7300:10:32.580 --> 00:10:55.989James Crowe/Vanderbilt: budgets, and you know all kinds of crazy stuff. So you see what I'm saying like, it is operational, detailed stuff that makes it go forward, and I'm the I'm on the pedal. I'm the one pushing the accelerator. If I don't, it's sort it moves, but it just sort of backs off. If I get in there, I make fake crises, and it all moves forward. I like that. But then, you know, I was excited about what you were teaching us about. The7400:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.819James Crowe/Vanderbilt: sort of not it didn't seem very detailed, is like stepping out into7500:11:01.990 --> 00:11:10.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: place of not time and having amazing ideas. And I want that to. So how to reconcile those things.7600:11:10.750 --> 00:11:21.269James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, you, you, okay, when you're writing. Okay, that's a creative space. That's kind of you, but then you also run businesses right? I don't know how you do all that. So toggling back and forth.7700:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.129James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, employees, if you let them down like that's not great. I can't just disappear.7800:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.642The Alliance: Let. Yeah. So let's let's talk about some stuff 1st of all, cause7900:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.445The Alliance: the 1st thing I think is8000:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.950The Alliance: what?8100:11:44.950 --> 00:11:50.860The Alliance: 10 years from now 5 years from now. Right looking back is you're doing.8200:11:51.390 --> 00:11:58.200The Alliance: I mean, if you're telling me you're spending most of your I'm looking at our, and you're running marathons.8300:11:58.370 --> 00:12:04.139The Alliance: and you've got a startup, an academic position, and a nonprofit.8400:12:09.160 --> 00:12:16.110The Alliance: I like. I look at that. And I go. That's not gonna work long term as a way for a guy like8500:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.750The Alliance: a guy who wants to get to his goal like I like.8600:12:21.030 --> 00:12:30.730The Alliance: if if you're if 50% of your time is literally going into art and you know the running, and it just like I'm not saying don't do those things.8700:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.010The Alliance: but I think they have to be8800:12:34.370 --> 00:12:53.890The Alliance: calendar and a little more metered out. I also think you absolutely are totally correct, like you're you me like. So it sounds like I do all this stuff. My day starts at 4 o'clock in the morning. So 4 Am. Till 8 Am. Is is mine. That's my books8900:12:53.940 --> 00:12:59.020The Alliance: right usually for the 1st 3 h, and the last hour is like.9000:12:59.020 --> 00:13:24.000The Alliance: did this today was the curriculum for month 2 for the Alliance like had to you right, because nobody people are not where I thought they were going to be there in a lot of different places. So I wanted to adjust the curriculum. You know, meet people where we are. We're a dynamic group. We knew this was gonna happen anyways, definitely happened. In a cool way. And I didn't want to overload with people. So like that was what I did right. So 3 h on that, and then took my dog for a hike and had breakfast.9100:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.200The Alliance: 9 o'clock. I had my 1st staff meeting, and I did staff meetings from 9 to 12 to 11309200:13:31.753 --> 00:13:41.169The Alliance: up launch and the afternoon was, I find I can do a creative thing. Meetings9300:13:41.350 --> 00:14:06.290The Alliance: launch for a reset, a creative like, you know. Deep thinking thing. More me like. Then I was talking to you after you. I talked to my accountant, which is like the least amount of brain power for the day. You know what I mean. Like he's got a he's he's at the tail end, and then I'll probably have a wrap up meeting with somebody in my staff right? And but I block it that way. I know I've got like these 2 creative things because they're9400:14:06.290 --> 00:14:15.300The Alliance: every day at the same time my brain is sort of prep for it, and then that's how this stuff gets slotted in. If that makes sense. I9500:14:15.980 --> 00:14:21.639The Alliance: calendar everything so like when I listen to all the stuff you're doing, I'm like, well, I wanna know9600:14:22.382 --> 00:14:31.769The Alliance: if you give the academic stuff an hour a day. If you give the startup an hour a day, if you give the nonprofit an hour a day, if you give9700:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.780The Alliance: running slash, art9800:14:37.720 --> 00:14:55.296The Alliance: an hour, a day, or 3 HA day like I mean, like, you know what I mean like? That's my my quest. My question is like, I think you want the regular exercise because you want it tuning your nervous system. I think art has to be a little bit more of the like regular reward and9900:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.970The Alliance: I don't know. I mean, I just like oh.10000:15:00.510 --> 00:15:22.650The Alliance: you can have an amazingly interesting life which you've had right. And I mean, I've talked to you right? You've had an astounding life for a very long time. So the question really is like, you can keep going right. You can keep going. And you're gonna have your. You're gonna you're gonna die and go. Wow! I had an astounding life, and the truth of the matter is, I would tell you. You know10100:15:23.430 --> 00:15:33.449The Alliance: the academic stuff is the backbone. So that's gotta keep going right like, I don't know why you started a mummy project, because that sounds like a massive overhaul.10200:15:33.450 --> 00:15:58.369The Alliance: And you know, if the academic stuff is literally the engine that keeps it going like, I would figure out like what drives that engine most easily with the least amount of pain from the Nia. You know what I mean. I do that cleanly your startup, certainly, where you're gonna freeze. I'm not saying, Shut down the mummy project because, like it's fucking cool like dude, I'm with you like I want to do that project, too. Like I'm with you. I get it. But, like you gotta prioritize10300:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.900The Alliance: the shiny, shiny buy. And here's the here's what I would tell you to do10400:16:04.130 --> 00:16:27.940The Alliance: as a next step honestly is, ask yourself in like one to 2 year long increments like, What do I want to get done 2 years from now? Is it that I want to have visited every major museum. Is it that I want to have run these through like? What exactly are are the goals that are going to make you look back and go. This was a killer year. Right? You have to. We have to figure out like to me. It's the10500:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.260The Alliance: engine you gotta like one of these things has to be like10600:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.820The Alliance: the engine, which I think is the academic thing.10700:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.739The Alliance: let that like figure it out.10800:16:38.740 --> 00:16:47.670James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean academic is a little bit shallow, for it's academic, I mean, we publish and sell science and nature. This is serious science, and10900:16:48.010 --> 00:16:56.130James Crowe/Vanderbilt: like, last year we got 3 drugs out of my academic lab into the clinic like a biotech company would do. So.11000:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.269James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know that that is the engine.11100:17:00.270 --> 00:17:18.899The Alliance: That thing that you're doing right. There is the that's the engine, right? That's the engine. So when I'm assessing stuff, or when I look@thingsfirstst The 1st thing I say is, what does it take? Eat myself and my people safe and secure.11200:17:19.069 --> 00:17:25.600The Alliance: right like my wife? All the people who work for me myself, because if that doesn't work.11300:17:25.980 --> 00:17:34.670The Alliance: that's too. Your tax on your nervous system is too high because we treat money as a fundamental motivator. And like, once you start.11400:17:35.310 --> 00:17:55.390The Alliance: you know what I mean, like, it's no longer like, you know, I spent today in budget meetings. You know what I mean, like, okay, I. My family's taking care of it, of all my people taking care of. And I've taken care of for the next year. And do we have that mapped? And what about the year after like that's was today? Because I wanna make sure that, like the stuff that is fear triggering for me11500:17:55.390 --> 00:18:08.039The Alliance: at all is is off the like that's got to be so to me. That step. That's how I think about it, based on my nervous system, and what we know about human performance. So is that lock solid. And if not.11600:18:08.320 --> 00:18:16.620The Alliance: that's what I would spend my deep work sessions on for a little while like, what? What does it take to lock that up? And when I say, lock it up, I mean.11700:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.799The Alliance: what does it take to run it in terms of like you have to do certain amount. You said it. You got to do certain amount of coaching. Is that11800:18:24.230 --> 00:18:36.660The Alliance: an hour a day? Is it an hour a day. How many meet like? What does that exactly look like? And what's the time? Commitment for that thing to run at the level that you are most comfortable with, and I'd figure that one out 1st11900:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.920The Alliance: right, and the other thing that I would figure out what I would put with it.12000:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.060The Alliance: I could be wrong here.12100:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.549The Alliance: I wouldn't fuck so much with the running.12200:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.340The Alliance: and you know what I mean in this strike, because it's a deeply meditative.12300:18:50.420 --> 00:19:14.589The Alliance: It's your primary flow activity. And we know if you're doing it less than 4 HA week, problems are gonna arise. And if you're like me and your primary flow. Activity is something like skiing. I have to train for it. Otherwise I'm just gonna like, you know what I mean. I ski 60 times a year, but I gotta train 3 to 4 times a week to be able to do that at the level I want to ski, and that12400:19:14.590 --> 00:19:37.670The Alliance: is most important to me, right? That flow state is most important to me, so I don't like. I never scrimp on skiing, and I never skip on the the core company. And the next thing that comes in for me is the writing right? Those are the like. Those 3 things are sort of going to get done pretty much every day if I can, because those are, I think about it that way. So like the question, then, is like between the startup and the nonprofit.12500:19:39.030 --> 00:19:48.679The Alliance: How to allocate time is that once a week, twice a week? You know what I mean like, how does that work for you? What do you? What does any of this make any sense? Can you start thinking about these things this way?12600:19:49.050 --> 00:19:58.910James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. Well, I mean, the nonprofit is kind of inactive, because in the era of Biden there was a lot of interest in pandemic preparedness investment.12700:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.340James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Right now.12800:20:00.590 --> 00:20:07.360James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Not only is Usg down on that, but philanthropists have stepped out because, Usg, they always want to partner.12900:20:07.360 --> 00:20:07.960The Alliance: Right.13000:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.540James Crowe/Vanderbilt: In fact.13100:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.989The Alliance: How many people are working? Are people working on that for you?13200:20:13.750 --> 00:20:20.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, it we were. We're it's a 5 0, 3 C. But it's like nested into another 5 0, 3 c.13300:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.430The Alliance: In other words, it's in a holding pattern, and you don't really have to pay attention to it right now.13400:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.480James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. That one's good.13500:20:25.480 --> 00:20:43.968The Alliance: That's what that was. The thing I was gonna tell you to do, anyways, is just be like dude. You're right. That you can't do that right like you. It would be you would spend so much time doing that thing right now that you wouldn't be doing anything else. I still don't know if you're gonna get very far, because, like, I literally like, I have friends,13600:20:45.490 --> 00:21:03.890The Alliance: business associates, let's say, who are very big and like Robert Kennedy. Anti vat like that whole world, and I'm getting photos of them in the White House last weekend, and I was like, I don't know what you like like that's I'm like, you know what I mean like. That's not a good sign.13700:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.370The Alliance: Just what I like. That's just not a good sign. And so.13800:21:09.810 --> 00:21:17.730James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, this is actually another, you know. Thought process for me when you're talking about fear and safety of all your people. It's entirely possible13900:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.160James Crowe/Vanderbilt: that.14000:21:21.130 --> 00:21:33.269James Crowe/Vanderbilt: so like, I said, we have about 150 million dollars of research money currently from the Federal Government. It's entirely possible that Kennedy and friends could just redline about 100 million of that, because they don't like the topic14100:21:34.190 --> 00:21:40.829James Crowe/Vanderbilt: like one of mine. I have a 65 million dollar grant that has Mrna vaccines in it, for instance.14200:21:41.470 --> 00:21:51.509James Crowe/Vanderbilt: it's already funded, but this is if they if they're looking around this kind of thing where they just take a pencil, and they just run it through and you get a letter. Stop work. That's what the letter says.14300:21:51.800 --> 00:22:06.389James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But I have lots of friends where this happened. So anyway, I I thought if I had the if I lost a hundred 1 million dollars in one day of the 150 over a 5 year period. I just couldn't do. I mean I it would be catastrophic.14400:22:06.590 --> 00:22:19.800James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And then the question for me, not, you know, I have to try to help the group. But for me, do I want to build back and fire a bunch of people and then build back for 10 years in an adverse environment?14500:22:19.940 --> 00:22:31.639James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Or would I, even at 63, after putting, you know, 30 years into building this capacity switch to do something else which would be, in my opinion, historically14600:22:32.350 --> 00:22:44.669James Crowe/Vanderbilt: terrible for the entire field, because we are the top one or 2 infectious disease antibody groups in in the world and in history, and I would just lose it and do something else, or would I just fight back? And I14700:22:44.830 --> 00:22:50.360James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I don't know if it's just my age or what. But I just think 10 years probably would take me to get back to.14800:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.299James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and I don't know if I would do it.14900:22:52.810 --> 00:22:58.089James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and so I do have some fear. I I don't project this into degree. I'm like, no, we're gonna be fine.15000:22:58.330 --> 00:23:04.120James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And in fact, we have 20 million dollars of royalties. We made that we can sort of self endow15100:23:04.250 --> 00:23:18.599James Crowe/Vanderbilt: for a while, but that doesn't go forever. Anyway. It's something in my mind. Would I switch? And under what? What are? What's the rubric under which I would decide this? This doesn't make sense to go on, and I I hate to even think that way. But15200:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.209James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know then my M Mtp. And my high heart goals. I just throw them out.15300:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.360James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Seems a lot.15400:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.620The Alliance: Like. So15500:23:34.428 --> 00:23:39.680The Alliance: I don't know. I mean yes, you know what I mean. Yes, that that could. I mean.15600:23:42.440 --> 00:23:50.270The Alliance: for example, it isn't very possible that, like my lifetime goal of doing a flow for the many program for the world.15700:23:52.390 --> 00:23:59.400The Alliance: I could do it. I could spend this year building it out and all that stuff. But I'm not entirely certain I'm going to be AI'd out15800:23:59.450 --> 00:24:28.479The Alliance: right like it. That may. Comp, that may happen so fast that, like I can't even get the product in the market in time. You know what I mean or the minutes out. Somebody's gonna spoof it. And yeah, so like, I'm looking at the same thing in a different category like I was gonna do this for fucking ever. And I shut down the flow research collective part to do this. And the AI is moving so fast. I'm well, I'm asking this. The question of like, is this even vaguely possible?15900:24:29.430 --> 00:24:40.679The Alliance: Which is, you know, which is real? So I'm like, I know what that sort of feels like we're like, I've been after this one for 30 years. And this is my final thought. I'd get a chance to do and have the data to do it and was ready.16000:24:41.100 --> 00:24:49.789The Alliance: It's an interesting question, different environment. You know what I mean. It's the AI environment and not the administration. Same kinda same kind of issue. In a sense.16100:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.080The Alliance: I16200:24:51.540 --> 00:25:01.819The Alliance: what I always do is I wanna first, st I want a backup plan. I want to know, like, what are the triggers, where I actually have to start laying people off16300:25:01.820 --> 00:25:21.810The Alliance: like doing things like that, like what are like, what are my? Just so I know. So that when crisis shows up. I already I've said I've made this deal with myself, these. When these 3 signs show up, I have to move. So it's so. It's not. You know what I mean. So I can track things a little bit. I find useful. Have you done that?16400:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.309The Alliance: Anything like that? Do you have triggers.16500:25:25.310 --> 00:25:31.650James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, we have plans for small, you know, so not all the Grants are 65 million. I'll probably get 30 grand, so if I lose one.16600:25:31.650 --> 00:25:51.870The Alliance: Yeah, that's I mean, that's what I was. What I was asking you is like, if you look at that list like, because the whatever happens, it's not forever. And let's let kid ourselves. Do we think viruses are going away? Do we think there's not going to be another pandemic? Do we think the Trump Administration's decision to do all this shit is gonna actually last through a crisis. Are you fucking, kidding me.16700:25:51.870 --> 00:26:00.940James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, I mean, we're we're on the edge of an H. 5 avian outbreak right now. I mean, it might happen right in front of us while everybody's watching.16800:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.240James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, we've been working on that. We have drugs for it. So I do think16900:26:07.060 --> 00:26:22.949James Crowe/Vanderbilt: what I'm doing and the way I'm doing. It makes, you know, enormous sense. And I think during a pandemic, when it happens, people are gonna turn to us and say, Go, and I want to say, I don't need to go. I already got it, and you know we've we've got17000:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.560James Crowe/Vanderbilt: solutions for 40 or 45.17100:26:25.560 --> 00:26:25.940The Alliance: I'm not.17200:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.280The Alliance: Thanks.17300:26:26.280 --> 00:26:48.460The Alliance: I'm not saying your dream is bad. Okay, I'm saying you have, like, I'm listening to you. And I'm thinking, Okay, this is a great dream. I love it, I mean, like of almost anybody. The alliance dude. You know what I mean. I look at your dream, and I'm like, well, we need this in the world, I mean. Come on, you know what I mean. This is a no brainer at some level.17400:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.409The Alliance: So the question really comes down like one way or another, like.17500:26:52.540 --> 00:27:12.049The Alliance: what's the scaled down version of it that still keeps you fulfill? I mean, when you you're like I can't fight, fight uphill for 10 years. No, I'm not telling you to fight uphill. I'm telling you to figure out what's the scale out version that you can run through a shit administration and still be deeply fulfilled without lose all the capacity. That's the17600:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.370The Alliance: yeah. Yeah.17700:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.390The Alliance: Those are the. Those are the questions.17800:27:14.390 --> 00:27:23.969James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. So this I, this is good conversation because I did think about this. So there is a group in Seattle that I've interacted with a fair amount.17900:27:24.100 --> 00:27:34.194James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And these guys are protein engineers. So they figure out how to make proteins better, cheaper, better quality. They used to be the Amgen protein engineering group. It was in Seattle.18000:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.580The Alliance: I knew those guys. Yeah, I know him. Jim.18100:27:38.381 --> 00:27:50.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: The company's called just or you know, they got bought. Now they're just evatec. And so they're all these high end guys. And then engine moved. These guys are, I don't know. Like probably late fifties, they didn't have to work. They're all rich.18200:27:51.060 --> 00:28:04.309James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and they're all highly technically. And when the company moved, they said, We don't want to move from Seattle. We got, you know, whatever their great lifestyle is. And so they started a company with like 8 or 10 of them. But there was only the High End guys.18300:28:04.630 --> 00:28:13.079James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, there was no staff at all, and they got a little startup space like a little crappy startup space with some benches, and they just started doing it themselves.18400:28:13.280 --> 00:28:36.449James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And they built, you know, they've rebuilt into a whole company that got bought out, and they have Vc. Flowing, and they've done a lot of projects. So I was remembering visiting them in their crappy little space with all the 58 year old guys actually doing the work and being super excited about it. And they didn't have to work. So that crossed my mind last week like if I could ex pull out the18500:28:36.720 --> 00:28:44.309James Crowe/Vanderbilt: probably top 8 or 10 people in my group like the senior people, the the really smart ones. And just say, Hey, we're gonna reboot.18600:28:45.190 --> 00:28:51.439James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, down the street in incubator space, not even academic. And we're gonna make it happen. I I do think that's possible.18700:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.620James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And again, that's you know me and these people that's where the expertise18800:28:58.180 --> 00:29:03.059James Crowe/Vanderbilt: really lies is in our minds of how to do these things. So yeah, that's a good.18900:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.219James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Maybe I should.19000:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.050The Alliance: That19100:29:05.470 --> 00:29:23.029The Alliance: like 8 people on a fucking killer project manager, and any and and an Ea for you, in a sense, and you could. You could reboot if you needed to, and and you know, keep your focus on the 5 things that we think are most important. Now you know what I mean.19200:29:23.030 --> 00:29:23.440James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.19300:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.990The Alliance: You know, and this stuff, by the way, with, with immediate drug potential. If you you know what I mean so you could.19400:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.500The Alliance: They'll fund it.19500:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.280James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.19600:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.179The Alliance: But I mean.19700:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.670James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know.19800:29:32.670 --> 00:29:39.440The Alliance: You and I both know that the 20 million dollars you have in residual is more than enough to boot up a new biotech startup.19900:29:40.090 --> 00:29:46.790James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, yeah, I mean, I've done my my real startup with 3 million of angel money. And now it's doing okay. So yeah.20000:29:46.790 --> 00:29:55.270The Alliance: That's what I mean, right? So like, I think you like, there is a backup plan. It's shitty to lose all those people and20100:29:55.610 --> 00:29:56.280James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.20200:29:56.410 --> 00:30:04.289The Alliance: And that sucks, and I'm with you. But, like I, from a fulfillment standpoint, especially with your level of novelty as20300:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.829The Alliance: August, it was sort of built right. I think he I think he did. By the way, I also.20400:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.280The Alliance: to be honest, think you'd be happier20500:30:12.890 --> 00:30:21.895The Alliance: cause you'd have one thing that was doing the one thing that you cared about, and then you could do running on the side, and probably have a little more time for art like.20600:30:22.190 --> 00:30:32.810James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm not overstated the art. I guess what I what I mean by that is. So I read, you know, if I'm at night I'll read a lot. I'll be reading about the shop or20700:30:33.565 --> 00:30:38.125James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and I look at a lot of images online. But I know a lot about. And20800:30:38.520 --> 00:30:45.469James Crowe/Vanderbilt: it. It takes up a large part of my creative open. I actually think it is a recovery20900:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.630James Crowe/Vanderbilt: cool, I mean, I don't21000:30:47.850 --> 00:30:53.979James Crowe/Vanderbilt: it? Maybe it violates your definition of flow. But if I'm sitting there 9, 10 o'clock at night21100:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.510James Crowe/Vanderbilt: reading about how Duchamp thought about you know why is playing chess?21200:30:59.930 --> 00:31:05.270James Crowe/Vanderbilt: The next tier of art beyond making objects like getting my mind around that.21300:31:05.550 --> 00:31:13.350James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's a you know. Czechami had that whole chapter in flow about abstract thought being, you know, one of the more.21400:31:13.350 --> 00:31:21.330The Alliance: It sounds like what you're doing, I mean, I can't tell. Like, if you're doing it 10 o'clock at night. Are you doing it to fall asle like. You're not doing this.21500:31:21.330 --> 00:31:21.650James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No.21600:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.310The Alliance: Sleep.21700:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.129James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Sounds like you're.21800:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.219The Alliance: Okay? So it sounds like what you're do. You're doing this to prime a deep work session.21900:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.570James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. Well, yes, I don't know. I don't know if you.22000:31:33.570 --> 00:32:03.040The Alliance: I mean, it sounds like a priming activity. I mean, if you're telling me you work till 3 o'clock in the morning, you're telling me you're looking at Art at 10 o'clock at night. Are you telling me that you've got a flow priming ritual because, like there's no difference than me going through reading writers. I like to find like inspiration before I get into a deep work session that way which I do sometimes you know what I mean, especially if my defension is folk. My focus is there? That's what I do. So if that's what you're telling me, I think that's great, and you have a pre flow, ritual.22100:32:03.340 --> 00:32:13.700James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I mean, they're intertwined. I I don't know if you've had time, but if if you haven't, you should look at my my intro video thing which I didn't make Chad a boom rod who used to be.22200:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.209James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I don't know if you know him. He's Npr.22300:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.800James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Radio guide.22400:32:17.800 --> 00:32:35.340The Alliance: You know, Jim, I just realized I think yours is the only like one of the only ones I didn't see. I don't know why I didn't. I just realized that you said it. I was like I didn't. I know you're right. I haven't seen yours. I don't know why they're literally like the list is open in front of me. Yeah. As soon as we're off I'll watch it, sure.22500:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.830James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's 6 min or something. So.22600:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.300The Alliance: No, I should have. I'm sorry I should have watched it ahead of time. I.22700:32:41.300 --> 00:32:48.659James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, no, I don't know but it it explains the art science toggle. And why a lot of our science is 3 dimensional22800:32:49.460 --> 00:32:55.759James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and patterned. And you know it's like pattern recognition and things like that. So the22900:32:56.250 --> 00:33:06.129James Crowe/Vanderbilt: the art, you know, the way people think of art is how I sort of inject that way of thinking or knowing into the science which is different. Most people are very, only technical.23000:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.039James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I and I do think this is part of why we do a really good job. But anyway.23100:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.170The Alliance: Let me ask you a question.23200:33:13.410 --> 00:33:13.920James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.23300:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.610The Alliance: Have you tried?23400:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.000The Alliance: So23500:33:17.210 --> 00:33:29.880The Alliance: I mean the goal, the the my goal of the call right is to come away with like just 3 or 4 things we should insert. You know what I mean to really like. Move you ahead over the next month.23600:33:30.290 --> 00:33:30.680The Alliance: Okay?23700:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.870The Alliance: And one of the things that makes me wonder is, what if you23800:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.260The Alliance: inner use some of the creative microdosing stuff23900:33:40.740 --> 00:33:49.050The Alliance: at the front end like, if if your workspace, let's say your marriage requires you to be in bed at 1230, not 324000:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.510The Alliance: hypothetically.24100:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.110James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Preferred is 9 pm. Okay.24200:33:54.110 --> 00:34:03.410The Alliance: Really is that is that when you're going to, because I like, I don't know how to do it. But what I was gonna say is before you do it. A deep work session. Every day I might24300:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.170The Alliance: product creativity, microdosing.24400:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.899The Alliance: On like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.24500:34:12.159 --> 00:34:31.560The Alliance: Do like 15 min of our prime, and what you're talking about, where you're reading about your job. And you're looking at stuff. And you're thinking about maybe 1520 min. You know what I mean and just see which one works best, because they're both doing the same thing right? We're trying to inject a little different perspective. And maybe with your love of novelty.24600:34:31.889 --> 00:34:57.800The Alliance: just schedule that in and make it regular and just test them. You'll you'll know, I mean, after like, 2 weeks of doing this, you're gonna know which one works better for you? Or if there's some combination, or do I want to use the creativity microdosing before I do these kinds of tests? And do I want to like? Does it lead in different directions? To my thinking, those are the kinds of questions that might be worth investigating. Is that sound tantalizing to you?24700:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.680James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah, that's good.24800:35:00.838 --> 00:35:17.209James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, I'm just like every I'm pretty hyper efficient. But I do fall into. Oh, I'll just check my email in the morning sometimes, and it's just deadly, completely deadly. And if I religiously said, I'm going to do the creative microdose thing when I have the impulse to check my email.24900:35:17.210 --> 00:35:40.699The Alliance: Well, that's why I was. Yeah, that's what I was using it. Because you batch. I mean you. I I personally believe the dumbest thing you could do is talk to your staff or check your email until you've gotten through a couple of your hard tasks, because, you know, they're gonna own. Your like other people. Shit is gonna own your life for a little while, and the minute you open that box you need about an hour and a half, 2 h to like25000:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.850The Alliance: wrangle it right? That's sort of what.25100:35:44.810 --> 00:35:54.350The Alliance: So that's how I I don't. I don't ever let other people make work for me before my work is done, because otherwise my work doesn't get done, and then I'm not fulfilled.25200:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.190James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And if I'm not fulfilled, everything crashes.25300:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.170James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.25400:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.689James Crowe/Vanderbilt: yeah, I know this cognitively. But I'm just confessing, like, sometimes I'll check my email in the morning. And that.25500:36:03.690 --> 00:36:18.879The Alliance: And I, I'm yeah. And I'm just like, you know, distraction management. You know. What I mean is with this with the peak performance stuff. It's really none of this stuff's fucking hard, right? It's just being committed to doing it every day and trying not to deviate.25600:36:19.170 --> 00:36:19.780James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.25700:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.900James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.25800:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.009James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, when I did the actually, just ztd, when we made the screen black, and25900:36:28.410 --> 00:36:36.110James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I got really good for about 8 or 10 weeks. I mean, I didn't touch my phone for like an hour a day. It was amazing.26000:36:36.440 --> 00:36:43.759James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And actually, when I was in this Greece thing last week, too. I mean, we didn't have any text. It wasn't. There wasn't a word you could look at, and you couldn't speak26100:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.240James Crowe/Vanderbilt: unlike the26200:36:45.640 --> 00:36:52.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: the decluttering that happened there was amazing. So I I'm a believer. I just, I need to get back to26300:36:53.320 --> 00:36:53.999James Crowe/Vanderbilt: a hundred percent.26400:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.169The Alliance: Yeah, it's I mean, it sounds it sounds like more than like26500:36:59.210 --> 00:37:09.988The Alliance: it sounds like again, like daily clear goals exercises. You know what I mean, really focusing on, what are the 10 things I'm going to do tomorrow, or however, did you have you run the clear goals26600:37:11.110 --> 00:37:11.930The Alliance: test?26700:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.229The Alliance: Figure out how many things you could be excellent at in a day.26800:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.520James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I have.26900:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.180James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I counted it the other day yesterday.27000:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.569James Crowe/Vanderbilt: cause I you know I've been working. I work every day.27100:37:25.570 --> 00:37:25.900The Alliance: Right.27200:37:26.440 --> 00:37:34.630James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Oh, I had about 20. And I got maybe 8 or 10 of them.27300:37:35.420 --> 00:37:41.540James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, had 20 on my list. So I have all these digital systems. I have a million to do lists, and we have to do lists, and you know.27400:37:42.250 --> 00:37:47.589James Crowe/Vanderbilt: spreadsheets. But every day I write on a piece of paper with a fountain pen. I like fountain pens.27500:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.380The Alliance: Exactly.27600:37:48.380 --> 00:37:55.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I write this, what I really want to do today. And yeah, it was. It was about 20, and I got about 8, 1012 something like that done.27700:37:57.130 --> 00:38:02.659The Alliance: Well, I didn't like I was really telling you to like count how many. So if you got 12 done.27800:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.819James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, count a couple more days right? Like, if if you find that like.27900:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.169The Alliance: After 5 days of counting.28000:38:09.410 --> 00:38:24.570The Alliance: It's always turning out to be 9 to 12 or something in there. Then you know you have your answer. This is how many things you can actually put on your clear goals list for a day. Right? And then it's just you have to filter by priorities. Kind of thing.28100:38:24.890 --> 00:38:30.379James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I guess the more I talk. You know I sound ridiculous. I think28200:38:30.910 --> 00:38:38.040James Crowe/Vanderbilt: we as a group are over committed. And I'm over committed. So it's it's28300:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.579James Crowe/Vanderbilt: kind of the have you ever had simple rules, and you know that book.28400:38:42.010 --> 00:38:47.159James Crowe/Vanderbilt: like starting things, is easy. Stopping them is hard, you know as an example. So28500:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.839James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I need to shore up the letting projects come in.28600:38:53.440 --> 00:39:02.410James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and maybe kind of a Marie Kondo event. In fact, that's that's a little bit tantalizing. If the whole thing melted down, I started back with 8.28700:39:02.580 --> 00:39:15.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It'd be like a for, you know, force Marie Kondo. It's like you only get 3 outfits. Which one do you want? So I need something like that. And I'm not good at eliminating projects unless my group just forces me to.28800:39:16.380 --> 00:39:29.879James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And sometimes I do. They'll march in and say we're done that cutler Guy. We're done with him. He never writes back. It's a struggle you need to write him right now, and often, and I will, you know I'll I'll I will down. But I I don't systematically control.28900:39:30.450 --> 00:39:34.580James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and I'm over committed, and I'm realizing that again while I'm talking with you.29000:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.010James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.29100:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.310The Alliance: Okay. So29200:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.260The Alliance: I think.29300:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.800James Crowe/Vanderbilt: To.29400:39:46.190 --> 00:39:55.829The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I like, it's really like, if we're gonna come over the next, a thing that you should. You know what I mean that you're gonna have that I think you based on what you just said.29500:39:59.330 --> 00:40:05.453The Alliance: You need to make a list of all the things in the world that you're currently doing like each of the projects.29600:40:06.150 --> 00:40:12.759The Alliance: and I mean, honestly, like, I'm listening to you.29700:40:13.340 --> 00:40:34.890The Alliance: Figure out like what you then then match it to like your personality and your predilections like which ones like which ones line up with who you are. And if it doesn't like, you know what I mean. That's the 1st thing because you're telling me you're starting your. You're you're making a list of what you really want to do that day right, and that's what's steering it.29800:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.250The Alliance: and you're overcommitted.29900:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.129The Alliance: Well, the 1st place to start is the stuff that30000:40:40.550 --> 00:40:42.889The Alliance: you don't give a fuck about.30100:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.960James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.30200:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.240The Alliance: Right.30300:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.849James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, it's kind of good, better best. It's none of it is terrible, you know, but it30400:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.870James Crowe/Vanderbilt: it's sort of.30500:40:50.870 --> 00:40:56.061The Alliance: Well, I I mean, I agree with you.30600:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.010The Alliance: but I you need some kind of filter right.30700:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.990James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've tried. My team gets30800:41:05.690 --> 00:41:12.959James Crowe/Vanderbilt: frustratingly. So we built a matrix project approval matrix. And we had a meeting. And they had to approve the projects I would nominate them in.30900:41:13.310 --> 00:41:24.800James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And then we had this matrix. That was a good collaborator. Is the collaborator funded? Do they have a specified person deleted on their side. Do we have money? Do we have a person? They had all these criteria.31000:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.376James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and that helped a little bit, but sometimes I'd be like, I just wanna do it31100:41:29.900 --> 00:41:36.820James Crowe/Vanderbilt: would kind of bust the system. So I you know, I'm just being transparent. I do have more enthusiasm than31200:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.940James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, then discipline about starting. And actually, I'm a very good finisher31300:41:44.754 --> 00:41:55.749James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and you know, perfectionistic. And Ocd, so once it gets on the list, then I might invest some of my best energy in something that's not worth it, because I have trouble just killing it.31400:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.960James Crowe/Vanderbilt: because I like to finish things and check the box. So31500:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.880James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, maybe.31600:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.840The Alliance: I. So here's here's the I mean, like I would start by like31700:42:09.080 --> 00:42:14.519The Alliance: I wanna if it was me, I would make a complete list of all the stuff I'm currently doing.31800:42:16.110 --> 00:42:24.429The Alliance: Second filter is, what's the stuff I really want to do? 3rd filter is what you just said. What's the stuff that's actually, if I give it31900:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.919The Alliance: 2 HA week for a month. It's done32000:42:28.030 --> 00:42:35.271The Alliance: right, or an hour a week, like what? What's the low hanging fruit to get to done so I could take it off and be done with it.32100:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.459The Alliance: right. And then I would like, and anything that like, if you don't like it.32200:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.319The Alliance: and you can't finish it quickly.32300:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.480The Alliance: It's gotta go right.32400:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.360James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah.32500:42:45.360 --> 00:42:53.500The Alliance: Right cause, then it then it doesn't fit either your criteria for who you are, I think, am I? Does this make sense as a filtering tool for you.32600:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.859James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You have.32700:42:55.970 --> 00:43:00.057James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, there's some other factors like if we're funded. If we have a grant.32800:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.059James Crowe/Vanderbilt: If we have a grant, we have some obligations to finish it.32900:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.960The Alliance: Totally. Yeah.33000:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Probably you know.33100:43:08.540 --> 00:43:14.890The Alliance: Well, anything that you have a grant like you have to finish. So then it's like, what like, what?33200:43:15.530 --> 00:43:32.040The Alliance: What gets that over this stuff across the finish line. You have the filters like you. You see them, you just I think you really just like need to spend some time just putting together the list and and this cross filtering them, the thing that you gotta remember. And the thing that33300:43:33.010 --> 00:43:38.179The Alliance: you know this because you have 3 drugs on the market, and you light up when you talk about that.33400:43:38.310 --> 00:43:47.210The Alliance: When you get these projects to completion, they're more fun than the novelty of all the new stuff having a big thing done is more fun.33500:43:47.410 --> 00:44:06.519The Alliance: Then a bunch of the fun new stuff and and like it's a more meaningful high, and it feeds us long term. So that's what I like. I think you sort of want to be like, okay, I'm a little bit of a much of a hedonist, and I just want to delay my gratification a little bit on these targets. Kind of thing because you're getting your hedonism33600:44:06.630 --> 00:44:29.160The Alliance: like from your running like. There's a lot of that stuff that's sort of fulfilling that. But what's not getting fulfilled is the long term stuff. And so just tilting it a little bit, 10%, 15% more towards the long term. Such I think it's gonna have. I think it'll I think it'll help. Also, I think the other thing that you want to start thinking about with this stuff, and why I'd want to do it is as you pointed out, the climate is weird33700:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.510The Alliance: and33800:44:31.260 --> 00:44:38.509The Alliance: you're not gonna it like you said it yourself. You're not gonna reboot. You already have a plan on how to reboot. You know what I mean like.33900:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.540The Alliance: No.34000:44:39.700 --> 00:44:56.380The Alliance: I like I would start figuring those things out. I don't know. Does that make? Does any of this make sense? Does it seem like there's a set of next steps in here. I I gotta. I gotta get on a call with Ryan and be like, Hey, you need to keep Jim accountable, and I'm not quite sure what he's keeping you accountable to.34100:45:00.750 --> 00:45:11.220The Alliance: Greg, other than regular reg regular creativity, microdosing experiment, and another kind of 4 or 5 days. Of how many things could I be an excellent edit today.34200:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.34300:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.169James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I guess. But it does.34400:45:16.170 --> 00:45:21.760The Alliance: Does it, does I? I would like to see what would happen if you, you know, just made a list of all this stuff34500:45:22.080 --> 00:45:30.909The Alliance: that you have to do, and then measured against, like your interest and enthusiasm, like where you are, and completion, like those 3 things.34600:45:32.080 --> 00:45:39.330The Alliance: seem like there would be a great filter for you if you're trying to figure out what should go on your daily clear goals. You know what I mean, like.34700:45:40.780 --> 00:45:49.959James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I haven't done the whole list kind of thing in a long time, actually, and I know I have done it. In fact, I used to be obsessed with David Allen, Gpd.34800:45:50.170 --> 00:46:04.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I always remember a video of him going in doing that with somebody where they put everything on the table, make all the lists. The person just puts their head down and weeps, you know, because to see it all in one place makes it real, and.34900:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.610The Alliance: Overwhelming and inappropriate and all that.35000:46:08.610 --> 00:46:17.830The Alliance: Yes, yeah, yes and no. Because I mean, like, I'm currently finishing 3 books, Guardian Company35100:46:18.410 --> 00:46:23.350The Alliance: and running enough like running, you know. Another thing, and35200:46:23.650 --> 00:46:31.634The Alliance: they're all used long crazy term. You know what I mean. Each of these is like 3 to 5 years and 2 to 5 years. Kind of thing.35300:46:32.610 --> 00:46:55.640The Alliance: I just know how they're metered out so like I don't like. I can give you the 100 steps. You know what I mean, like none of it freaks me out because I know how it's spaced out. They're like, Oh, yeah, we're just gonna do this every day. And it's gonna move I got. I'm like, okay with it. I see what you're saying, and that, by the way, my problem with some of the these list things with is like, I don't think you should do this all the time.35400:46:55.640 --> 00:47:14.960The Alliance: like some of these people are like this is, you know what I mean? I'm like. No, no, let's like, do it. Once get the figure out what needs to go where and sort of put it away until you're through, like what I like to do is like these are my 3 to 5 high art goals, and until they're done I don't think about anything else. Everything else is a no, it's a no.35500:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.199The Alliance: these are these are the goals. Everything else has to be a no, until something moves off the higher goal list.35600:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.380James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Hmm, view?35700:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.829James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, that's not.35800:47:27.290 --> 00:47:33.610James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I do add things, even though my hard goals are done that's, maybe that's the35900:47:34.640 --> 00:47:40.580James Crowe/Vanderbilt: practice. I'm missing is waiting to add until I complete some things, you know.36000:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.410The Alliance: Oh, you have36100:47:42.410 --> 00:47:47.650The Alliance: to switch you had the so you here, I mean, do you want me to be really frank with you?36200:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.36300:47:48.210 --> 00:47:51.979The Alliance: You're a dopamine junkie, and you're addicted to the wrong dopamine.36400:47:52.190 --> 00:47:59.179The Alliance: You're addicted to the dopamine of novelty because it's fucking easy and fast, and you're not addicted to the dopamine of36500:47:59.330 --> 00:48:09.800The Alliance: ticking goals off on a clear goals list. As long as you stay on the shiny new stuff. You're not gonna get36600:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.899The Alliance: to your mission level goals.36700:48:12.020 --> 00:48:20.130The Alliance: You just can't unless, by the way, I mean the only Peter Diamandis did it.36800:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.480The Alliance: The36900:48:21.680 --> 00:48:39.900The Alliance: through the shiny way where he chased shiny objects for a really long time, but ultimately most of them ended up failing. You know what I mean like he didn't have like he. He's made a big impact as a thought leader. He's helped unlock the space frontier with the X price. The X price is37000:48:40.000 --> 00:49:08.480The Alliance: contributing. And I and it does like. Each of those prizes has 20 million dollars with the spin off innovation. You know what I mean like, there's good stuff coming out of it, but I look at it, and I'm like dude. You're not as far as you want to be, because you've it's all shiny, happy, and you keep going from thing to thing to thing rather than I'm going to. And now he's sort of drilled down on fountain life, and he's got a number of things pointed in the same direction. It's getting better. But like I watched him spin wheels for 20 years, just chasing that.37100:49:09.050 --> 00:49:17.040The Alliance: I know, like one of the things about really being a creative leader, is understanding that the like dopamine that comes from meaning and37200:49:17.040 --> 00:49:40.470The Alliance: well-being and overall life satisfaction is more than the stuff you get from the hedonic novelty chasing. But you don't believe it's true until you start really like ticking those things off. Or maybe it's not for you. Maybe it's really not. Maybe like you look at those 3 drugs that you got, you know, like the big things that you accomplish, and you're like, no, no, actually, it's way more fun to start a million projects. I'd rather do that37300:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.189The Alliance: right. And if you'd rather.37400:49:42.628 --> 00:49:44.820James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I would doubt. Yeah.37500:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.410The Alliance: I'm not saying you can't have both. But you gotta pick an order, man.37600:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.860The Alliance: It's like there's no like until you sort of pick out, figure out what's next. You're still like.37700:49:56.060 --> 00:50:04.660The Alliance: you know, doing that. And then you're gonna keep like, spend a week with me. And then you went and did a workshop a week later. That was a week long, and37800:50:04.910 --> 00:50:11.580The Alliance: you know I mean, those are 2 delicious fun weeks. But like your workshop with me and you. You37900:50:11.980 --> 00:50:32.650The Alliance: put it into gear and apply it. You went and did something else that was fun. The whole point of this is to like really advance towards your mastery. I'm not saying bad or good. I'm just saying these are the decisions you're making. Are you sure you want to be making these decisions like, is this right? Is this where you want to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now.38000:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.860James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You.38100:50:36.570 --> 00:50:42.160James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, I think it's like you said before, it's more like a tilting. It's not an either, or because38200:50:43.730 --> 00:50:49.449James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean again, I'm my labs are the most productive in the world right now, and we're making.38300:50:49.450 --> 00:50:49.840The Alliance: I mean.38400:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.010James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's not like, we're failing. Yeah.38500:50:52.010 --> 00:51:10.350The Alliance: No, I'm not saying you're failing at all. I'm just trying to get you like you came to me and said, I really like I got a massively transform. The purpose of the world needs right? And I want to keep moving closer to that. That's all I'm steering by is what you said was your most important. That was your that was what you came in with like. That's what the38600:51:10.350 --> 00:51:10.720The Alliance: I am gonna38700:51:10.720 --> 00:51:19.232The Alliance: said. That's what our 1st call said, so I'm like, Okay, how do I get you? A few steps close to that in a meaningful way.38800:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.050James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.38900:51:20.050 --> 00:51:24.130The Alliance: You're I mean, the good news with you is like a lot of this stuff that39000:51:25.420 --> 00:51:39.640The Alliance: you know what your high art goals are. You don't. We don't have to do the passion recipe. You know what I mean. Like done. That portion of the creative path finding is done for you. We just have. You just have to do some filtering and some some sequencing.39100:51:40.980 --> 00:51:59.329The Alliance: You know what I mean, and I'm not even saying don't do all the shiny, happy stuff. But I was saying, maybe put off 10 of the shiny, happy things for a year, so you can get through these. You know what I mean. And then that's that's next year, and I don't know, I mean, but I I'm not looking at all your projects. I'm just trying to give you39200:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.459The Alliance: ways to think about filtering.39300:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.859James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Any of this make any sense?39400:52:04.390 --> 00:52:08.630James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, I like not putting something on a list until39500:52:09.550 --> 00:52:16.979James Crowe/Vanderbilt: something significant, like the things should end. They should not be all, every everything can't be open, ended and add, that doesn't.39600:52:18.740 --> 00:52:32.084The Alliance: Well, it'll it's also gonna eat RAM in your brain right? Like it is right. You're watching it eat RAM in your brain, and especially if you're I'm like you. I like finishing. I don't like anything open, ended bugs me?39700:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.280The Alliance: God! No.39800:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.690James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Like, do you? You get 2 thirds through a crappy book, and then you still finish it or not.39900:52:43.690 --> 00:52:58.780The Alliance: I do. Are you? Yeah, I like mo you. It has to be really crappy, like I'll I now I've now allowed myself to close, crappy book, for before it was always finish it right now I'll be like, no, you are actually wasting my fucking time. I'm done.40000:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.700James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Right40100:53:00.620 --> 00:53:05.839The Alliance: Provided I'm not trapped on an airplane with nothing else to read. But that rarely happens to me, you know.40200:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.770The Alliance: Yeah, yeah.40300:53:06.770 --> 00:53:11.344The Alliance: Other than that. No, I I'm done with it. Well, the other thing I do is40400:53:11.980 --> 00:53:37.879The Alliance: books that aren't exactly my like. I have toilet reading. I have a book on each toilet, and so the books that are no longer compelling where they get, they slow down. If it slows down, it goes under the toilet, and I read 2 pages every time I go to use the toilet. One page. If it's if I'm taking a piss, I'll literally stand and read 2 pages, and I'm sitting down, and I'll just read through the stock part, or I'll finish the book that way. That's how I do it. But I have like.40500:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Okay.40600:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.780The Alliance: 2 2 books that aren't moving, and you know a couple that are.40700:53:41.980 --> 00:53:47.549James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, alright. Well, I'll commit to make a list of all the stuff, and that alone might be40800:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.080James Crowe/Vanderbilt: something meaningful. And then.40900:53:51.690 --> 00:54:15.839The Alliance: Literally, I would start by start by. This is who I am, my personality like, and you just want to like. What are my risk tolerances? Do I want to manage people? Do? I don't like how conflict avoided them like those? Just what are my invisible skills, my really great at, you know, but that sort of stuff. Get your predilections and all your stuff on one side, and just get the full list on the other, and41000:54:16.910 --> 00:54:20.880The Alliance: you know, maybe another in, and then, you know.41100:54:21.910 --> 00:54:26.939The Alliance: I would categorize like these are the. These are the things I love. These are the easy to41200:54:27.450 --> 00:54:52.085The Alliance: finish once, and if it's not, I love it, and it's easy to finish. It's the open like open question. And I would start matching onto my personality. And if something like doesn't. If there's a project that's in the bottom that doesn't fit your personality at all like it's not not actually gonna fire you up. That much could be really hard in a way, and like it's like, that's the 1st stuff you kill. You know what I mean.41300:54:53.970 --> 00:55:05.029The Alliance: it shouldn't be that much. You know what I mean. Probably like 2, or there's probably like 2 or 3 or 4 projects that are linking there. 5 that are taking up cognitive load is probably not a lot, but it might help.41400:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.660James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Some of it's just hard, like.41500:55:10.540 --> 00:55:20.140James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, it might take 5 years to develop the expertise and the people, the technologies and everything, and the expertise to actually do what we want to do. And I know that I'm patient.41600:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.130James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But41700:55:22.800 --> 00:55:33.909James Crowe/Vanderbilt: it's sort of like I do have the core business of making antibodies for infectious disease, and I got my list. That's my empty. Well, the Mtp. Is changing the practice of medicine, you know, but the high heart goals is41800:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.590James Crowe/Vanderbilt: the 100, I guess.41900:55:36.185 --> 00:55:40.440James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And these things are not necessarily in that line. They're.42000:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.700James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'll give an example like42100:55:43.440 --> 00:56:04.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: one of the innovations would be. You give the antibodies in the arm or Iv. But let's say the infections in your brain. Well, you don't need the drug in your bladder and your leg. You need it in your brain, and your brain is protected by blood-brain barrier. So stuff doesn't just go in there, and so antibodies for brain infections don't work very well.42200:56:04.780 --> 00:56:15.549James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And what we want to do is do some technology where we get up to the broad brain barrier, recognize something on there and trick it to actively transport our drug into the brain.42300:56:15.810 --> 00:56:32.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and then we have tissue delivery. So we're delivering it to the right place where it needs to be, and it's a great vision, and a lot of other people would love to have that, for you know Alzheimer's and other reasons. So it's a great thing, but in a way that could be my entire lab. I mean, there's people who spend their.42400:56:32.370 --> 00:56:49.729The Alliance: That's yeah. Yeah, James, that's what I was about to tell you is like, I'm listening. I'm like, that sounds like a mission level goal that doesn't even seem like a higher goal. That seems like an maybe it's a higher goal. But that sounds like a mission level goal, but would revolutionize the treatment of brain diseases.42500:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.590James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.42600:56:51.650 --> 00:56:52.910James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. But42700:56:53.070 --> 00:57:14.640James Crowe/Vanderbilt: if it were, yeah, I mean, we don't need to figure out everything. We just need to get the antibodies in the brain, but that I'm offering it as an example of something we've started. We got 2 or 3 people doing it. I could aggregate 8 people doing that over 5 years. But it's not in the make, the 100 drugs thing. It's an improvement technology.42800:57:14.810 --> 00:57:24.999James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And if I really had to say, Wow, that's gonna take a lot of time and thought, it's interesting. I think we could contribute. But it's not sweetly in our expertise.42900:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.260The Alliance: Hmm.43000:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.109James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, that's something that43100:57:28.340 --> 00:57:33.399James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I do like it, and I do think ultimately could do it. But there's just a large investment.43200:57:33.550 --> 00:57:39.030James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I'd like that one. I like that one. You may. You may have just made a really good argument for.43300:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.020The Alliance: Bum.43400:57:40.290 --> 00:57:48.709The Alliance: Or, by the way, maybe the way forward is, find a partnership lab.43500:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.850The Alliance: And you know43600:57:52.350 --> 00:58:03.160The Alliance: you know what I mean. Park it for for a while and find and see if we can find a partner lab, because that that seems like it. Might you know what I mean like that might benefit from that kind of thing that makes any sense.43700:58:03.370 --> 00:58:08.350James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, we have industry collaborator. We have, you know, brain guys at Vanderbilt. But like, we're43800:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.429James Crowe/Vanderbilt: part of the momentum, I think.43900:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I don't know. I need to think about that. I I have 2 or 3 projects that are like that44000:58:15.870 --> 00:58:19.180James Crowe/Vanderbilt: that are high complexity. Long term44100:58:19.450 --> 00:58:23.150James Crowe/Vanderbilt: cannot possibly can't do it now, but it's a dream that we could do it.44200:58:23.670 --> 00:58:30.420James Crowe/Vanderbilt: uncertain that we could do it. So it's interesting. But it could be an entire person's.44300:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.330The Alliance: Sort of led by. So I had. So I have one of those44400:58:33.430 --> 00:58:47.280The Alliance: which is really my intuition research, which is now like the next frontier of that is, I is, I've done some work on synchronicity, and where that might be coming from, and what causes that? And we're doing some work on the hard problem consciousness.44500:58:47.280 --> 00:59:06.470The Alliance: And it's a series of papers with like big thought. You know, the next one comes out of nature in a couple of weeks. It's these are big deal papers, as you know. But it's like it's been a 30 year research program to sort of like, I just keep it moving forward. I do one thing at a time. Do I want to do like more? I haven't like the the44600:59:06.660 --> 00:59:23.474The Alliance: fucking, hard problem consciousness paper, which is probably what's going to be next. I've been kicking at it like a little bit at a time for a while, and I'd love to like, and I can't like I let myself have one of those, because I can't. You know I don't know any other way to do it. And44700:59:24.590 --> 00:59:28.820The Alliance: I haven't found a way to like even putting a bigger team on. It doesn't like44800:59:29.100 --> 00:59:51.349The Alliance: I gotta be the guy driving it. Otherwise the team goes sideways. You know what I mean. They they they get, they they miss the like, they over complicate stuff based on their own. I'm like, no, no, this is much simpler. This is really simple ideas. I mean could be fucking wrong, but you know they're not that that sort of stuff. So I get it. But I try to. I sort of like let myself have44900:59:51.670 --> 01:00:14.190The Alliance: one of those, and I'm not saying you need to be me. You have a big, you have more people around you and more resources, right? But like for me, I'm like I got the RAM for about one of those sort of ongoing developmental projects that, like you know what I mean. Like the papers I'm aiming at a book on intuition that I've been aiming at now, clearly aiming at for45001:00:15.710 --> 01:00:25.340The Alliance: 6 years or 7 years ago, maybe 10 from the 1st time I met Danny Kahneman like direct like, Oh, I'm gonna like fuck you. You're wrong. I'm gonna write a book right like.45101:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.059James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah.45201:00:26.301 --> 01:00:33.800The Alliance: Danny, and I've been well before he died we were. We had an argument that, like about intuition that lasted 10 years. Every couple of years we'd have another argument, and.45301:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.190James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.45401:00:34.190 --> 01:00:40.749The Alliance: Know I've been aiming at this for a while, so I have one of those, and I let myself have one of those, and I try to dip in like45501:00:42.090 --> 01:00:49.759The Alliance: an hour to an hour and a half a week is what I really give that project. That's how I that's you know in my in my life. That's what it gets.45601:00:52.290 --> 01:01:01.890The Alliance: And then I'm gonna have to lean in oh, like over the next couple of months, as the paper gets rid of it'll it'll get more. And it's you know, it's gonna get a couple of days as I'm actually doing it. But45701:01:03.600 --> 01:01:10.080The Alliance: nudging it forward has been that little bit. So I don't know. I I like it that way. I'd like to see what happens when you45801:01:11.520 --> 01:01:20.059The Alliance: list out your honey thing. So I'm gonna I the the as far as I can tell this is where we've come to, and I think these are actually45901:01:20.650 --> 01:01:24.079The Alliance: not bad things to do. But46001:01:24.290 --> 01:01:39.290The Alliance: you can focus on and it's gonna be in line with some of the stuff that we do next month, so we won't like add too much on. There's only like one sort of really heavy new component coming in next month. And it's not even a heavy thing. It's just a cool idea.46101:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.919The Alliance: But we you, I wanna see what happens if you46201:01:44.690 --> 01:02:03.860The Alliance: like. Let's make before your deep work sessions. You have an art flow ritual. Let's try creative microdosing, then. And you know, in between the others, just to see, I just want to see if it it like, if it actually which one gives you better ideas is really what I'm hunting for. There.46301:02:04.240 --> 01:02:11.094The Alliance: Clearly, you're inspired by art, and we want to nurture that as a as a sort of pretty deep work, ritual kind of thing.46401:02:11.970 --> 01:02:27.820The Alliance: And I like that. I also like you know I love how you started your day. I don't think you should change it for me. You know what I mean like, do you? Fucking meditation? Go right like, do it. Do it your way. Kind of stuff. I think you should list all the all the projects you have going on. So there's a project list46501:02:28.020 --> 01:02:28.810The Alliance: bum.46601:02:29.250 --> 01:02:36.480The Alliance: And then you wanna list like the second half of that is like shit. You can complete like shit46701:02:36.640 --> 01:02:48.580The Alliance: that you can complete. So you get through it and get it off the project list, because I think, ultimately, like you sort of want, like one of those. You know what I mean at the top of the list. Let's start knocking some of those things off.46801:02:49.104 --> 01:02:56.196The Alliance: At least to get that farther. And then the personal predilection list right? And they start looking on46901:02:57.730 --> 01:02:58.900The Alliance: And, by the way.47001:02:59.450 --> 01:03:04.650The Alliance: don't go fucking crazy. You know what I mean. I know your project list could be a thousand things long.47101:03:05.190 --> 01:03:18.780The Alliance: You know what I mean. Pick your like. Go 2030, 50. You know what I mean like this. This shouldn't be days, man, you should be able to like, complete all this stuff in a couple of hours. If you want.47201:03:18.780 --> 01:03:25.610James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, I already have all this stuff at work with my project. Managers have all these lists. I just have to have them send them.47301:03:25.610 --> 01:03:33.910The Alliance: Put together, put it together, and just do the audit man make sure you're make sure you're make sure you're happy with how you're doing it.47401:03:35.370 --> 01:03:40.394The Alliance: is like, and the last thing I want you to keep doing is47501:03:43.400 --> 01:03:50.919The Alliance: figure out how many things like you've done it once you know what I mean. Track your daily excellent list a couple more times, however many I like.47601:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.010The Alliance: you know, data. How many times do you have to track your daily excellent list before you're going to believe your own data.47701:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.400James Crowe/Vanderbilt: How about you?47801:03:59.730 --> 01:04:03.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: 2 to 4 weeks? Really, I mean, this stuff goes up and down.47901:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.960The Alliance: Then then you know what I mean.48001:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.080James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'll do it.48101:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.760The Alliance: Okay, I like, I just, I like48201:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.239The Alliance: these are some pretty simple filters.48301:04:16.490 --> 01:04:22.550The Alliance: You know what I mean. You'll do that. You'll dial in your clear goals, and then you'll dial in your high, hard goals.48401:04:25.030 --> 01:04:29.680The Alliance: You might not hate me when it's all said and done. God damn it, that codlar.48501:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.700James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, no, I'm excited about all this. I just sort of chewing on it. And48601:04:36.190 --> 01:04:40.129James Crowe/Vanderbilt: again, I don't think I'm I don't think I'm completely broken, but I.48701:04:40.130 --> 01:04:55.550The Alliance: I don't think you're broken at all, man, I don't think you're broken at all. I think you're super fucking crazy, effective, like I think I just trying to get you like, if I said this at the beginning, I could. You end up being 5 to 10% more effective than you are now48801:04:56.143 --> 01:05:00.530The Alliance: and a little happier. You know what I mean. I think that would be48901:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.860The Alliance: that'd be a sick. You know what I mean for guys at our level.49001:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.110The Alliance: 5% boost is like, Wow, that. Thank.49101:05:07.110 --> 01:05:07.680James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.49201:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.599The Alliance: You know what I mean. Like you, you know.49301:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.220James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's like.49401:05:10.220 --> 01:05:10.660The Alliance: Yes.49501:05:10.660 --> 01:05:16.549James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, these guys who win the tour? Their their Vo 2, Max is just like 1% better. Anyway.49601:05:16.550 --> 01:05:26.910The Alliance: That's like, I can't say this to people at the front end of the alliance because it doesn't sell sexy. I'm like dudes. If you're in this fucking room. If I come into your life and make49701:05:27.180 --> 01:05:40.000The Alliance: this is a 2 to 5% difference in your efficiency like overall, you actually know what that like a year, what that actually is gonna amount to? But so49801:05:40.360 --> 01:05:48.860The Alliance: you know, I think we're, gonna I think we're gonna have a bigger impact than that if you if if you lead in. But like even the small impacts are sort of huge49901:05:49.080 --> 01:05:49.820The Alliance: bum.50001:05:50.220 --> 01:06:01.060The Alliance: I you're gonna have a lot of fun on the I wanna I what I'm really excited for now is the movement stuff. You're my rigor. Now I got a rigor. You've been doing some of this stuff?50101:06:01.060 --> 01:06:01.789The Alliance: Yeah, no, I guess50201:06:01.790 --> 01:06:11.940The Alliance: a ringer in there which is kind of cool. Have you been? Have you been jumping into any of the breakout groups that have been going on or on the meeting with the Alliance stuff.50301:06:12.770 --> 01:06:21.439James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I've been reading the AI stuff which I don't understand. I mean, we kind of use a little bit, but I don't really know how to innovate in that. So that discussion.50401:06:21.550 --> 01:06:35.670The Alliance: I sort of like. I mean the where this is going. Jim, is. Everybody's sort of got their specialty where their people are kind of calling on their expertise. When we get to the 4th month. Right? I'm having you do these creativity, Microdose. The 4th month is like.50501:06:35.670 --> 01:06:56.780The Alliance: basically take take the stuff you've been doing. That's fun for you, plus the stuff you made in your collage, and then make a video or whatever to train up the alliance in your in your skill. So whatever people keep asking you for your token and like, that's what we're gonna try to capture at the end. So we have a full library for the afterwards.50601:06:58.390 --> 01:07:04.129James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. And it was also interesting spinning through everybody's videos like, there's some killer people in here, and they're very.50701:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.409The Alliance: God, did you? Did you see Courtney's rap.50801:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.730James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.50901:07:09.030 --> 01:07:11.789The Alliance: I think you laugh. I laugh so hard at Courtney.51001:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.470The Alliance: I was laughing really hard. I don't like.51101:07:14.470 --> 01:07:15.030James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.51201:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.490James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But I mean being able to. Kr woman like drawing.51301:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.295The Alliance: Oh, my God!51401:07:23.825 --> 01:07:34.290The Alliance: not, Sonia! I just blinked her name Sandra Sandra. Her drawings! Oh, my God! Are you kidding? They were amazing, too.51501:07:34.290 --> 01:07:34.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You said.51601:07:34.750 --> 01:07:47.660The Alliance: She got a little help on them, so I can't tell how much is totally like, but like dude so much better than anything I've ever done. I was like, Oh, I like, I'm embarrassed now. Yeah.51701:07:48.016 --> 01:07:48.729The Alliance: I agree.51801:07:48.730 --> 01:07:53.155The Alliance: I agree there was some, really. No, there was some really spectacular stuff in there51901:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.120The Alliance: all right. I gotta jump.52001:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.020James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.52101:07:58.790 --> 01:08:03.700The Alliance: I will see you on May on June second.52201:08:04.420 --> 01:08:04.785James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.52301:08:05.150 --> 01:08:26.169The Alliance: Which is our next thing. It it's feeling pro like I'm as I said, 90 min, 2 h, I'm thinking where it'll it'll probably 2 h. Most of it's going to be breakout groups. So I'll have you guys, you guys working. I'll probably I'm I'm I'm trying to like, really talk your heads off for only like 30 min, because I think we've had enough of that for a little while.52401:08:26.510 --> 01:08:27.290James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.52501:08:28.405 --> 01:08:29.060The Alliance: Cool.52601:08:29.069 --> 01:08:34.262James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I'm going back to the materials, too. Wow, the videos. I'm glad you videoed them, because that was just like.52701:08:35.260 --> 01:08:49.990The Alliance: Oh, yeah, I mean, by the way, I you know, as I said to Ryan, as I said to every I was like it was great, and I really liked it. But the 1st thing I thought is, after working one on one with everybody. I started in the wrong spot52801:08:50.421 --> 01:08:58.868The Alliance: like we should have covered some of the creativity stuff, but the flow cycle and some of the other stuff could have been booted till next like second month.52901:08:59.944 --> 01:09:06.045The Alliance: we're re. What we really spent a lot of our time on what everybody I've been working with is is really creative pathfinding stuff.53001:09:06.399 --> 01:09:11.059The Alliance: So it's you. You can't really call it goal setting, because it's much53101:09:11.229 --> 01:09:22.399The Alliance: a much more sort of complicated process than people do with goal setting. But that's really it seems like where everybody started. So we're gonna review that stuff like, you know what I mean, because there's a.53201:09:22.720 --> 01:09:29.209The Alliance: You'll just to give everybody the exact framework. So you all have it. That's what we're gonna do. And then we'll and have you53301:09:29.600 --> 01:09:41.619The Alliance: the, have you been playing with the thinking about? Well, complete concentration? You obviously have to be talking about distraction management already the challenge skills balance. Have you been thinking about how you attack your projects to stay in your sweet spot?53401:09:47.220 --> 01:09:53.760James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I mean, I know that framework very clearly, intellectually, but we don't.53501:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.220James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I don't use that my day to day vocabulary at work. I use it, you know, myself, so I haven't.53601:10:02.220 --> 01:10:15.179The Alliance: I use it by. I don't know if I use it. I don't use it. Really use with my teams that much I just choose with myself like am I? Is this project in that sweet spot? So I can, you know, drop into flow. And really, you know, maximize my time on it.53701:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.120James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that might.53801:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.599James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, when I'm listing and then doing personal predilection, maybe I align it there that.53901:10:24.600 --> 01:10:43.190The Alliance: Well, that's what I was. That's exactly what I was gonna tell you is like, once you sort of get that stuff out. The next step in determining how we chunk it into clear goals is, how do you? That's how you divide it up right? What's like a 4 or 5% push today. That's how you sort of know. So yes, that's exactly what what we do next. Alright, cool.54001:10:43.730 --> 01:10:44.480James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Alright!54101:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.740The Alliance: Good pace.54201:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.010James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Thanks for your time.54301:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.210The Alliance: Thank you. Bye-bye.
