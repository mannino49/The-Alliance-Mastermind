WEBVTT100:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.660The Alliance: Oh!200:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.609Zoom user: Hey? Can you hear me?300:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.690The Alliance: App.400:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.760Zoom user: Am I coming through.500:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.379The Alliance: I can hear you. I can't see you.600:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.029Zoom user: Oh, okay, hold on. Let me see if I can get that working start. Video. There we go.700:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.800The Alliance: Aye.800:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.911Zoom user: How are you doing, sir?900:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.459The Alliance: Good! How are you? Where were you?1000:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.329The Alliance: Did you.1100:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.899Zoom user: Well, I mean.1200:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480The Alliance: Click the link all the way through.1300:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.409Zoom user: No, I had trouble getting on the zoom, and then and I was about 3 or 4 min late, and then I finally got the zoom working.1400:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.239Zoom user: And then, thank God, you texted because I was like, Oh, no, he's gonna have left. Sorry about that.1500:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250Zoom user: I'm a little bit re. I'm remote today. It's1600:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.579Zoom user: It's a holiday in Canada, and we bought a property at the lake. So we're up doing some work here on the cabin.1700:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.569The Alliance: Here's the thing I'm gonna we're not gonna spend any time on this. But I have to say, this is my one of my favorite things about Canadians.1800:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.560The Alliance: I know how big Canada is. I've spent a great deal of time there. Ladies are actually like, yeah, we spend time up at the lake. I'm like you've got a fucking 1 million lakes1900:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.759The Alliance: like which way?2000:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.379The Alliance: No way like you. The lake we up at the lake, what?2100:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.810The Alliance: Well, you guys invented hockey dude. You're like, shut up stuff at the lake.2200:02:09.363 --> 00:02:13.240Zoom user: Yeah, we're building an oasis out here.2300:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.740The Alliance: So let me I want this, this, our our time is, really gonna be focused on sort of2400:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.420The Alliance: advancing through your challenges. But I the place I want to start. Is.2500:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.128The Alliance: you noticed? I know you. You joined us digitally, but2600:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.534The Alliance: They take a fire hose approach to2700:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.490Zoom user: The term.2800:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.168The Alliance: To information. And one of the reasons I love that I love that approach is2900:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.769The Alliance: I'm looking for what sticks3000:02:45.830 --> 00:03:13.419The Alliance: I'm looking for like. There's no fucking way. Everything I said over those you know that day is gonna is gonna have stuck. But 3 or 4 things are gonna have really sort of resonated and probably led to immediate action. And those are always interesting, like those are always like, Okay, those are the things that probably aligned with you or immediately solve problems. So they're often good places to start a conversation. So what's stuck with you? What is sort of turned into action? What's a little different since we began.3100:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.240Zoom user: Yeah. Great question.3200:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.081Zoom user: Or was the whole thing shit? And you you're sorry you did it.3300:03:18.637 --> 00:03:28.079Zoom user: No, it's you know what? Going back to the art of the impossible was that key, and then going back. And and when we did the call.3400:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.179Zoom user: you said something to the effect of maybe you're just here3500:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.570Zoom user: to figure out what your Mtp. Is.3600:03:36.045 --> 00:03:53.770Zoom user: And that that was interesting. So I went back and I did the work again on the 25 things. And so if you're okay, I'll just kind of read to you. I just kind of jotted down a couple of pages of notes. And that might help you form where and cause I thought the best use of your time3700:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.729Zoom user: is just to get you to, you know. Have a dialogue about the Mtp. And just some questions that I've got about it.3800:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.860The Alliance: Perfect.3900:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.620Zoom user: So4000:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.260Zoom user: you talked in the book about the capital. I impossible can be accomplished by doing the lowercase. I? Impossible!4100:04:11.794 --> 00:04:15.610Zoom user: The lower the lowercase I impossible would be transforming.4200:04:15.740 --> 00:04:27.750Zoom user: So when I originally did this, when I got the book a few years ago and and did flow the flow research collective stuff, the coaching, and all that kind of thing, I thought. I want to change the way the world communicates.4300:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.840The Alliance: Yeah, I saw that in your in your onboarding.4400:04:32.640 --> 00:04:43.870Zoom user: So now what I've done is I've thought about this thing. The other thing that jumped out to me was this vertical thinking and horizontal, thinking that Dr. Sarah talked about, and you jumped in on.4500:04:44.850 --> 00:04:53.429Zoom user: And I was thinking about what are the prerequisites to horizontal thinking so? And you talked about superpowers, so that I guess when I was thinking about that.4600:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.890Zoom user: I've never dabbled in systems so like4700:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.280Zoom user: I'm not from sure if you're familiar with4800:05:01.430 --> 00:05:14.879Zoom user: David Allen's getting things done. Byron. Katie's got a book called Loving what Is. And it basically just goes. You go to work on all your thoughts and that kind of thing. And when I got those 2 things I dove right in, and I went4900:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.550Zoom user: like a year and a half on each of those programs.5000:05:18.100 --> 00:05:37.290Zoom user: Now, I've arrived at a place where I can really compartmentalize, so that systems thinking has come out. So the other thing I wrote down as a quote from your book, no matter how mind bendingly improbable a trick looked on the front end, there was always an understandable logic on the back end.5100:05:37.640 --> 00:05:46.459Zoom user: So, as I was going through. The 25 curiosities and that type of thing. This is what I come up with. These are the lateral connections.5200:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.230Zoom user: Leadership is both structured and adaptive.5300:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.119Zoom user: where leadership strategy meets performance psychology.5400:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.570Zoom user: So that's a lateral connection. I see in my interest5500:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.030Zoom user: alignment between personal identity and professional expression.5600:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.970Zoom user: So I'm fascinated with dissonance both in music and in, you know, like5700:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.840Zoom user: as an executive and that kind of thing. I struggled with the fact that, you know I'm a heavily5800:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.309Zoom user: tattooed guy and all that kind of thing. There's a dissonance there, and that that there was a curiosity there.5900:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.759Zoom user: So what I wrote down is where humor.6000:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.480Zoom user: cultural fluency, and vulnerability show up as tools, not just traits.6100:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.080Zoom user: I've got 5 of them. So 3rd was, how language, tone, and structure move people.6200:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.190Zoom user: My lens seems to be influence. How to lead, persuade, and inspire with.6300:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.690Zoom user: So I think we'll Ryan.6400:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.279Zoom user: I hope I don't lose you now. Here we go.6500:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.120The Alliance: A guy got you. You came back.6600:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.670Zoom user: Good. Yeah. Okay, good. 4 are layers of logic and cause and effect.6700:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.170Zoom user: So my instinct is to build and fix systems, diagnose, clarify and optimize systems.6800:07:09.990 --> 00:07:20.870Zoom user: and then number 5, driven to gain control over internal states, sharpen the edge, increase clarity, and embody influence, transforming the way you show up so6900:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.549Zoom user: where I was struggling, Steven, is that at this point in my life, and I the part that jumped out to me was this piece I always felt like7000:07:28.700 --> 00:07:35.919Zoom user: the massively transformational purpose that when I was getting down to what I really love to do and where I get flow, it's too small.7100:07:36.770 --> 00:07:48.600Zoom user: So from an ingredient standpoint. Right now I've got 2 boys that are coming into the business. I love working with business owners that are 5 million and under backbone of of the economy.7200:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.419Zoom user: and when I meet these business owners7300:07:52.240 --> 00:08:02.050Zoom user: they know their revenue numbers. They know their tax numbers and that type of thing. They don't know how they're exiting the business. They don't know how to have a personal life after that.7400:08:02.250 --> 00:08:19.809Zoom user: you know, and know that there's these pillars you got to look at the business. You got to look at your finances, and you got to look at your personal plan. That kind of thing. So it felt too small. But that's where my passion is is really going. So I'm working on the massively transformational purpose in that effect.7500:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.630Zoom user: That's a lot. So I just fed you.7600:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.202The Alliance: No, no, no, no, no! So7700:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.289The Alliance: 2 things.7800:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.829The Alliance: I'm gonna go backwards at them. So one7900:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.789The Alliance: start where you ended, which was the8000:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.800The Alliance: small business under 5 million backbone America, and sort of like8100:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.880The Alliance: there's sort of 360 degree communication around them. I don't think there's any such thing as too small. So in8200:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.469The Alliance: publishing there's 2 ways to make a bestseller.8300:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.199The Alliance: you can go, General, cast a huge net and hope you can catch enough fish that way, or you can go deep.8400:09:05.350 --> 00:09:23.399The Alliance: find a niche, and own the niche, and go deeper than anybody else, and just be excellent in that in that niche, and both are incredibly viable ways to affect really dramatic change. And, in fact, ultimately, I think what ends up happening is if you go really deep in a niche.8500:09:23.440 --> 00:09:47.370The Alliance: Essentially what I did right flow. It does like it's got a wide horizontal, but it's a niche like it's a single. It's a single thing. I happen to choose a single thing because it's the foundation of all, even performance it. It holds quite a lot, but it's a niche. And I just went deeper and deeper and deep. You know what I mean, and I just didn't. I still have to stop so you can do a lot8600:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.512The Alliance: going small, so don't like I want to disavow of that idea.8700:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.520The Alliance: cause. I also like to point out that all this stuff is emergent, right? Like Mtps are not.8800:10:00.030 --> 00:10:23.609The Alliance: They're probably 5 to 7 year plans. 10 year plans right? And then the next one emerges. Out of that you know what I mean. They tend to, they tend. Who you become is an emergent property, and you can't figure that out until you start going after some of these Mtp. Level goals and going through them, and like seeing how they how one leads next. So that's the 1st thing. The second thing is8900:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.490The Alliance: When I hear you telling me what you're curious about.9000:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.790The Alliance: I hear abstract categories.9100:10:34.290 --> 00:10:41.951The Alliance: I don't hear super specific things, not a criticism, just an observation right?9200:10:43.470 --> 00:11:05.760The Alliance: to really start cooking with fire. The brain wants you to be as specific as possible. So one thing I think you want to do is like you've got a bunch of high level categories one. It looks like a lot of them cross over right? It does seem like there's some intersection between what is essentially performance, psychology.9300:11:06.090 --> 00:11:23.939The Alliance: communication and systems that is interesting to you. Right? They all all the. There's a bunch of different approaches to said things, but like those seem to be the broader categories. I could have missed one. And I could be wrong. Does that sound semi, even vaguely right to you? And looking at what you did.9400:11:24.528 --> 00:11:27.470Zoom user: Yeah, sounds, actually, really, accurate.9500:11:28.340 --> 00:11:37.299The Alliance: So to me, those are 3 things like, there's 3 buckets. There's communication, there's performance, and there's systems. And then my question is, how specific9600:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.990The Alliance: underneath each of those, and you get which9700:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.260The Alliance: think is worth really drilling down into and9800:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.393The Alliance: so, for example, you had some questions about9900:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.405The Alliance: identity.10000:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.730The Alliance: You know, individuality versus Ver versus collective culture. Whatever. However, we want to phrase that you know what I mean.10100:12:11.876 --> 00:12:12.613The Alliance: And10200:12:15.050 --> 00:12:25.696The Alliance: that could be looked at a bunch of different ways. But that sits underneath 2 buckets, the one those are really important10300:12:26.410 --> 00:12:46.759The Alliance: performance questions because you don't want a performance strategy that doesn't map onto your identity. The one of the things that corporations do really wrong a lot is they will pick out performance strategy that maps onto the founder or the CEO's personality without realizing that like, if it's not a neuroscience based strategy.10400:12:46.760 --> 00:13:00.929The Alliance: it doesn't scale across personality. And all you've done is like alienated views not made in the in the image of the CEO kind of thing, right? So there's that category exists. And under the communication thing what I 1st thing I could tell you is that10500:13:02.990 --> 00:13:12.729The Alliance: the individuals guys with the tats, the weirdos, as a general rule, always end up winning the communication more10600:13:12.730 --> 00:13:38.529The Alliance: they end up getting to have the microphone, because you trust the individuals more than you trust the person who was the Borg. You just do, and I don't know why that is, but it tends. So there's there's a communication thing in your idea about individuality that's interesting, that you know I like gives you a platform to talk about stuff gives you a way, and and where that gets really interesting and and where it dovetails10700:13:38.630 --> 00:13:44.250The Alliance: together is, there's an entire science to authenticity. We're not.10800:13:44.460 --> 00:14:06.439The Alliance: It was one of the open questions of how much or how little of it I was gonna cover in this class. And it seems like we're gonna do a little more focused sort of like goal setting stuff and and like that sort of stuff, and and probably not make it all the way to authenticity, I would guess. But there's a whole science of authenticity and authenticity is coupled to attention.10900:14:06.440 --> 00:14:18.330The Alliance: Attention and autonomy are coupled systems. So if you're not being authentic, you can't maximize attention, which means you can't communicate effectively. You can't like all that stuff. There's a whole bunch of like11000:14:18.490 --> 00:14:35.979The Alliance: stuff that's downstream from where you are. So the more specific you get with your interests, the more you can start unlocking those like areas of knowledge that'll start to crystallize like the Mtp. Into high art goals or things along those lines. You may not.11100:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.450The Alliance: in a sense11200:14:38.580 --> 00:14:50.663The Alliance: you cause. Your interests are are diverse and interesting. You may have to like, pick a high, hard goal inside the communication category and another one that's inside the11300:14:51.510 --> 00:14:59.379The Alliance: performance category and just pursue both those in tandem for a little while to wait to see where they're gonna start to intersect, which is.11400:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.760Zoom user: Tonight.11500:14:59.760 --> 00:15:12.235The Alliance: You know what I mean totally fine like if you, if you come out of this with 3 or 4 verticals to really be diving into and going going deep in. You know that those are big steps forward right? And11600:15:13.240 --> 00:15:21.908The Alliance: you're like, it's interesting. I've it's interesting talking to different. I just had a call with somebody else who's almost exactly where you are.11700:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.194The Alliance: it's all about being patient with yourself, and11800:15:29.240 --> 00:15:58.050The Alliance: letting letting stuff naturally sort of emerge. And just you would. The 3 things the things you want to always consider is one you got to keep feeding the curiosity right and getting more specific and feeding the curiosity. And 2, as you start to really drill into specifics, you see that you want to start turning up the challenge level. It's no longer you don't want to just spend like 90 min investigating this subject. Now, you wanna you know.11900:15:58.620 --> 00:16:27.910The Alliance: I'm gonna give a presentation on it and work a month from now, just something that like forces you to take it the next step a little bit. So you just keep walking up that challenge skills ladder with it as things emerge. Because as you start to challenge yourself inside these areas of curiosity and just like little fun, interesting, experimental ways, how do I react? Do I like this? What's up to Iraq? The things that are are coming clear are a couple of things. One. You'll get farther right. You'll just get farther, because it'll force you.12000:16:27.910 --> 00:16:36.070The Alliance: you know, bump into other people and their ideas. And like all that stuff, and the second thing that it will start to do. And this is12100:16:36.130 --> 00:16:44.149The Alliance: this is sort of later on, but it's a useful filter, and you sort of touched at it. You you were poking at it.12200:16:44.990 --> 00:16:54.609The Alliance: You have very specific ways. You like to live what you like to do, who you are, where your skills are. And so your personality and your passion12300:16:54.770 --> 00:17:11.680The Alliance: should be a filter for maybe not your Mpp. But definitely for the higher goals that are going to flow out of it, because you don't want to be going after higher goals. I always tell people that one of the things that one of the errors that people make, and I think it's a cognitive bias. And I just we haven't named. It12400:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.900The Alliance: is that people have this weird assumption that when you have a mission.12500:17:19.230 --> 00:17:28.689The Alliance: it's gonna transform you into somebody. You're not who's able to go after that mission. And that actually doesn't. It doesn't seem to work that way like the people I know who've actually12600:17:28.690 --> 00:17:52.510The Alliance: accomplish their missions have found a mission that is totally aligned with who they are, so they couldn't not accomplish that mission, like my mission wrapped around books is exactly who I am based on. Like, among other things, the fact that I will naturally wake up at 3 30 in the morning, and like, if you don't have a fucking book to work on, you'll be crazy by dawn.12700:17:52.650 --> 00:18:14.899The Alliance: like you better have a long pro, like a deep project to carry you through those dark hours of night, or you're gonna be left alone with your head and eat yourself alive. Right? I. My purpose is so aligned with who I am. As a person I can't help but publish it just in like sort of living my life. That's how I I tend to think about that makes sense. Is it useful?12800:18:15.420 --> 00:18:29.710Zoom user: It's very useful because it's helping, because I think what's happening is, I've seen a lot of synergies around a lot of different things. And they they're just kind of naturally coming into play like I've got 2 boys coming into the business, and I love working with them.12900:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.159Zoom user: If I'm dealing with a business owner13000:18:32.360 --> 00:18:53.929Zoom user: preparing them for exiting the business and that type of thing. Well, there's all these family members that are involved. Right? So you know what's going to happen with the kids? What's going to? And we end up. When I 1st started this work, I thought, Wow, where am I? I don't have the capacity to deal with entire families. And all of a sudden my 2 boys showed interest in joining the firm and the business. So13100:18:54.100 --> 00:19:00.759Zoom user: okay, well, now I've got that capacity because I can still work with the business owner and that type of thing, and then thinking about13200:19:01.110 --> 00:19:07.950Zoom user: when I talk to a small business owner, and they're talking about a management concept. I can tell what the last book they've read.13300:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.990Zoom user: and like those management concepts are from 90 or 2,000. You know that kind of thing. So.13400:19:14.170 --> 00:19:33.890Zoom user: bringing what we see at a like a fortune, 500 level down into that business. And then also all this work around talking to the business owner and being able to say, Hey, what are you going to do after this is done? Because 75% of business owners. According statistically, the studies that we've looked at. They regret selling the business. One year later.13500:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.370The Alliance: Oh, yeah, across the board.13600:19:35.370 --> 00:19:35.730Zoom user: Awesome.13700:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.149The Alliance: Across the yeah across the boards. I always tell people13800:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.400The Alliance: this is a lesson I learned13900:19:43.060 --> 00:19:50.820The Alliance: a long time ago, and I think it's super fucking true for entrepreneurship. I think it's true for everything, so I don't finish a book14000:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.119The Alliance: until I've started the next one.14100:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.239The Alliance: 2 reasons. One is, you know, unless it like.14200:19:59.490 --> 00:20:13.630The Alliance: unless unless I'm exhausted like, unless it was one of those books that took everything out of me. And I really actually like, and what I need to do is the passion recipe and sort of just like, live with it for a while. But as a general rule, I always try to have a next project14300:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.610The Alliance: for 2 reasons. One.14400:20:15.960 --> 00:20:28.480The Alliance: if you know what's next, is, it keeps the other one. Otherwise, like the sale, the visit, the aspect of the business, or the last book I wrote becomes the thing, and I don't wanna be about the old thing. I want to be with the new thing right.14500:20:28.480 --> 00:20:28.810Zoom user: Right.14600:20:28.810 --> 00:20:56.160The Alliance: And I want to keep my focus on the note. New thing, because then things that go wrong with the old thing a bad review, or you know, a bump in in closing the business, because I mean, you know as well as I do shutting down a company is fucking hard, and things go bump, you know things go wrong. So I always think that like absolutely next week, because it'll hold your energy and like won't crush your heart. But I think you know I've been, you know, if you're gonna shut down your business at least14700:20:57.523 --> 00:21:14.689The Alliance: like not just a hobby, but like a hobby plan for the next year like this, many hours a day, and like otherwise, your timing to alive and your mindy to alive and like. You're not prepared for it, and I see what happens then is people start scrambling for their next thing.14800:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.589The Alliance: and that's never wise, because you end up saying yes to shit. You shouldn't say yes to.14900:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.760Zoom user: Yes.15000:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.330The Alliance: Right.15100:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.440Zoom user: Yeah.15200:21:23.390 --> 00:21:32.689The Alliance: So I'll give you an example like I watched I watched my father when he sort of started retiring, and he's by the way. He was a family planner and the like. He knew this stuff.15300:21:33.170 --> 00:21:55.270The Alliance: and he just like he got Antsy. So he said yes, to like 50 nonprofit ports. And suddenly he was like, You know what I mean. He was like that was his life, for I was like, Oh, my God! What am I like, and finally got down to like 3 where he was like. But it was absurd like it was just hysterical like. He didn't plan properly, and then scrambled, and then said, yes to all this stuff and made a mess.15400:21:55.779 --> 00:21:58.091The Alliance: Yeah. And I see people do that. So15500:22:00.490 --> 00:22:18.050The Alliance: I like what you're. I like the passion filters like passion. Passion, recipe is what you're doing. Passion filters are like sort of what you're these are. This is who I am. This is what I want to do. These are the assets I have. This is how it fits into my life. You know what I mean, like you don't want to come up with a mission if you only want to work.15600:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.200The Alliance: you know.15700:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.070The Alliance: 5 days a week15800:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.749The Alliance: don't come up with a mission that's gonna require 2, 4 set. You know what I mean, like.15900:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.250The Alliance: whoever you are. It, you know.16000:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.489The Alliance: make it make it match. Otherwise it just is demotivating. And16100:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.479The Alliance: I don't like, yeah. Okay, so what next on your agenda? What are we going? Where are we going next?16200:22:40.040 --> 00:22:49.539Zoom user: Well, that was the big one, I was thinking. If I could get some clarity around and I'm I'm starting to already. I think the the clarity that I'm getting is I I've got all of these16300:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.469Zoom user: circles that are kind of converging16400:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.970Zoom user: but what I was trying to do is, I think.16500:22:58.150 --> 00:23:06.659Zoom user: intellectually frame them into one thing, but what I'm hearing is, and I already started to think about this like I've got.16600:23:07.080 --> 00:23:21.939Zoom user: We had talked before about. You know the firm wanting me to step into a new role. So they actually sent me out the job description and that kind of thing. I read through it. I thought, this is going to drive me crazy. I really do. I don't think this is for me that type of thing.16700:23:22.130 --> 00:23:41.139Zoom user: There are some. We're looking at field activation rules, which this is. This is kind of, okay. Because I said, you tell me what you want the humans to do. That's what I. What I'm passionate about is getting them to do that stuff and figuring out how to do it, figuring out where we need to go in that and looking at charts and graphs that's boring to me.16800:23:41.360 --> 00:23:49.640Zoom user: I want to know what the people are passionate about, what their goals are, and then help them get to that. So I think there's a field activation role in that. I'm 51.16900:23:50.580 --> 00:24:03.209Zoom user: If I did 3 or 4 years for maybe 4 or 5 more years of leadership on 55. At that point in time I can. I can run this frame on on the business owner, angle.17000:24:03.610 --> 00:24:11.439Zoom user: step out of the business. The boys are running the business, and then all I'm doing is consulting work with with businesses that are 5 million and under.17100:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.199Zoom user: But really taking that framework of, hey? This is not just17200:24:15.680 --> 00:24:24.639Zoom user: what's the best way to sell. Do you sell to management? Do you sell to partners? Do you sell to a 3rd party. Do you know it's what are you doing after?17300:24:24.800 --> 00:24:31.799Zoom user: Let's make sure that that's squared off before we even look at these options and that kind of thing, and really helping these business owners.17400:24:33.135 --> 00:24:38.139Zoom user: Exit in a healthy form. So I think what I'm hearing.17500:24:38.140 --> 00:24:44.360The Alliance: I've got I've got. Yeah, no, I've got. That's a much more like that sounds very.17600:24:44.530 --> 00:24:56.575The Alliance: That's a that's a mass that's a high, hard goal. That's less of a mission. Right? You. The mission is clear. That's sort of a higher goal. And that's that's a different framework to solve.17700:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.889The Alliance: and the framework I would use for that one. This is how I was to think about it is.17800:25:05.370 --> 00:25:31.209The Alliance: there is something let's call it a workshop for lack of a better. There's a workshop that you're gonna come out with, you know, 5 years where you'll be running for small business owners like 5 million dollars right, and you'll get 20 guys in the room, and it'll be, you know, a week long or 2 weeks long, or however long, or maybe it's 1 on one, but either. Needless to say, there's a framework you're already talking to you about it. There's like it's not. There's so what I tell people is17900:25:32.200 --> 00:25:56.029The Alliance: the framework is is your, that's the high, hard goal. So what it make. Write down a hundred steps between where you are and what that framework is right. Everything you would need to do, including like, are you doing this inside the firm? Are you taking this out? So if you're taking it out of the firm. There's marketing. There's all just everything you could see. Get it down the list, and then.18000:25:56.270 --> 00:26:12.129The Alliance: as you'll know, look back at the list and make sure. You know there's not invisible stuff in between the things you're looking at right? You will probably end up with. I tell people to aim for a hundred cause. It's, you know, and the point that there's 2 advantages here. One is.18100:26:12.310 --> 00:26:25.200The Alliance: The worst thing is to get on your way to a new thing is to get blindsided. But the thing that you thought was a single line of of like on the to do list and you get there. And it's actually a 5 month step.18200:26:25.330 --> 00:26:51.339The Alliance: and you weren't ready for it or budgeted for it. Time, wise money wise any of that that you want to make all that stuff visible. So there are no surprises, because those are demotivating, and they're they're, you know you. Why deal with them if you don't have to, and if you get the full visualization, you could figure out, what do I want to outsource? What's not me? What should I get other people to do for me along the way, but once you sort of get that 100, and this may not be18300:26:51.580 --> 00:27:04.570The Alliance: in the end your Mtp. This may just be that a next step to see where this one starts to leave, and you can start drilling down. And I always. So you end up with your, you know. 1st you get your 100 steps, then you take your your18400:27:04.570 --> 00:27:28.800The Alliance: sort of filters like this is who I am, and this is what I could do. You start mapping those together, and you start to figure out which of these steps is for me. Which ones do I outsource? And the next step after that is, what's the what's the chronology? What's first, st second, 3, rd 4, th and 5.th And once you get that chronology, that's your that's how you put things on your clear goals list. Then you just you know what I mean. Then it's just a question, right? So like with that one18500:27:28.840 --> 00:27:37.290The Alliance: that one can, you can start to crystallize, you know a lot more or at least like get it to the point like.18600:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.410The Alliance: Oftentimes, you know this.18700:27:40.530 --> 00:27:58.056The Alliance: the win isn't so much. I know what to do. It's red, light green light. Oh, I don't want to do this. Oh, I do want to do that right, like some of this is still like that kind of epic. So I like, you know, I don't necessarily know if I you know, you're gonna run this 100 step exercise, or whatever. And18800:27:58.330 --> 00:28:14.715The Alliance: You may discover that this isn't something you want to do, because you start looking at their steps. And you're like fuck. This is not. This is actually the wrong fit, and that's that could be a huge win. Right? We don't. We don't want you to waste time later. We want you to do the, you know. Run the experiments now, and see how they feel.18900:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.830The Alliance: Does that make sense to you?19000:28:17.920 --> 00:28:25.840Zoom user: Totally does. Yeah, that was perfect in in drilling that down, because that some of the language I was getting confused between the Mtp. And and the but the framework of.19100:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.170The Alliance: Yeah, I'm gonna so we're gonna we're gonna literally June, second19200:28:30.460 --> 00:28:39.309The Alliance: work. When we do our next thing, I'm gonna walk everybody through. I didn't cover this, and if this is my, so19300:28:40.670 --> 00:28:46.449The Alliance: I had the I I may. I made some assumptions about who I thought19400:28:46.750 --> 00:29:14.670The Alliance: people were going to be, and where they were going to be in their career, and I don't know what I was making. I don't know what I was basing my assumptions on. You know what I mean? Like, I just really like, I didn't realize he even made any assumptions until I like gotten through. And I was like, Oh, wow! This is maybe not a creative velocity accelerator as much as a creative, pathfinding accelerator like we get to the velocity part later. But like, we gotta actually start with the creative path, finding accelerator is. And so19500:29:14.950 --> 00:29:37.940The Alliance: if you know, next time I do this, that's where I'm starting right. But I get a I. There's a very specific I've developed like these are bits and pieces of it. But there's a here's the Mtp. Stuff. Here's the right passion recipe. We'll go through all that, so you'll be able to see it, and you'll have it recorded for you fully. So some of the stuff will come back, and I'll I'll you know. I'll tell Ryan everything you're doing, so you can19600:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.340The Alliance: hold you accountable.19700:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.560Zoom user: Okay.19800:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.420Zoom user: But it's.19900:29:41.420 --> 00:29:59.660The Alliance: It sounds like if you start running these passion filters just to figure out who you are, what kind of world you want to let you know you want to be. You really keep advancing your passion recipe and getting as specific as possible. And then, with one thing that you can see? Which is I wanna and I, by the way, I, fucking love that you want to help20000:29:59.800 --> 00:30:13.509The Alliance: my big like those are. Nobody get. Everybody wants to do these big sound like no mid market companies, man, Mid-market companies are the most they're the most interesting and the most like oddly vulnerable.20100:30:13.910 --> 00:30:14.450Zoom user: Totally.20200:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.270Zoom user: Total.20300:30:15.270 --> 00:30:23.220The Alliance: And yeah, I really, I'm a, I'm a big fan of them. And I've actually, I cause I used to start having to make choices20400:30:24.270 --> 00:30:52.691The Alliance: roughly around 6 or 7 million dollars that are totally like your models don't work anymore. You need new models, and those new models usually make you compromise your values in a way that you're not exactly comfortable with right. But if you're staying under that, you can actually like design a company that is exactly in line with who you are. And that, I think, is kind of from a flow performance perspective. I think that's kind of cool. I like that.20500:30:53.030 --> 00:31:00.979Zoom user: That's you know. That's exactly the piece is that when you start to get like when I talk to business owners and I start to talk about exit planning20600:31:01.350 --> 00:31:09.099Zoom user: and starting to think through what that looks like that type of thing. And they've never had situations where they had somebody pull out a theme20700:31:09.230 --> 00:31:29.770Zoom user: set up, you know, and a timeframe on that theme, and then run it back into 90 day sprints. Hold the team accountable, so sometimes what happens is they come into those themes, and they're like this is exciting. I'm excited about the business again. I want to grow it. But then you have to have hard conversations, but well, growing is risky right where you are20800:31:29.940 --> 00:31:39.780Zoom user: to get to that next stage, to become best in class compared to those people that are in that 10 million plus. This is what's on the table. And it's just like you said, where they can come back and go. Oh, okay.20900:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.259Zoom user: No, I don't want to do that. I'm 65 years old.21000:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.579The Alliance: Yeah. Yeah. And it's also it's also there's no like21100:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.600The Alliance: you can unwind a 5 million dollar business pretty easily.21200:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.489The Alliance: Once you get like21300:31:51.760 --> 00:32:01.839The Alliance: once, you know, I just unwound a business with a hundred employees like I went from a hundred employees to 4 right? And it, you know, it was a year and a half21400:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.230The Alliance: and a21500:32:03.510 --> 00:32:26.129The Alliance: crazy type rope that like you know what I mean, like I like. If I would have known what unwinding the company would require when I started the company. I don't know if I would have ever started the company if somebody would have sat me down and been like dude. Do you have any idea what it is to shut down this kind of business that you're starting? I had no idea if you would have told me. I don't know if I would have started the business.21600:32:26.384 --> 00:32:40.129The Alliance: For sure. It's to find a lot of stuff around how I think about the alliance, and what and and what I want to do, because, like I see the upside down side, it's just, and I love it. I like, I'm like, oh, I got more information. I can steer better now. Cool.21700:32:40.330 --> 00:32:40.960Zoom user: Yeah.21800:32:41.400 --> 00:32:52.929Zoom user: yeah, you know, the cool thing about the Mtp. And all this, too, is that there's certain business owners. I just like, you know I want to work with. You know, there's a lot of the guys that they just started from scratch.21900:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.540Zoom user: They don't have.22000:32:54.810 --> 00:32:59.879Zoom user: you know, a college degree. And and that kind of thing, you know. They started out with a truck.22100:33:00.420 --> 00:33:18.840Zoom user: and then their accounts receivables in the backseat, and then they figured out they need to have a bookkeeper and all that, and then, all of a sudden, now they have 50, 60 employees, and this you know, and but they don't know how. Now they're at a stage. And this is, it's almost epidemic. In North America. There's a ton of business owners that are baby boomers.22200:33:19.030 --> 00:33:28.190Zoom user: and they're holding on, and they don't know how to transform these companies or how to sell them. And that type of thing. So the the market for this is huge. It's it's really, really big.22300:33:28.190 --> 00:33:37.340The Alliance: Yeah, it sounds like it sounds like it's huge, and it like it sounds like a dope fit for you, because it just seems like exactly who you are. It reminds me of a22400:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.470The Alliance: Do you know, Tommy, Mellow.22500:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.939Zoom user: I don't think so. No.22600:33:41.940 --> 00:33:50.110The Alliance: Tommy. If he's got a podcast. He's got a billion listeners. He's me. LO, he's22700:33:51.990 --> 00:33:57.740The Alliance: the Guru of garage door installations he built22800:33:57.740 --> 00:34:24.921The Alliance: like right. He he turned a backyard drive or into like, I think it's the biggest in North America, you know. Like his house is colossal. It's you know what I mean, like he and he's but he's really like the blue collar guy. I've done slow stuff with him. I've been on his podcast I like him. I like blue collar guys. I grew up in Cleveland. You know what I mean, like like that totally makes sense to me and I but I also22900:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.079The Alliance: I watched the23000:34:30.090 --> 00:34:37.740The Alliance: construction guys. The plumber like no exit plans. No, I I mean, they have some version of retirement23100:34:37.850 --> 00:35:02.759The Alliance: that is essentially an Rv. And driving around the country with their wife. But they're not really like nobody's bothered to say, you know, I just wanted you to live on each year. Okay, multiply that. By how many years are you going to be retired right like, do the math? Do you have enough? Well, that's a starting number for what you can sell your company for, and then, you know, blah blah like they don't even bother to like. Do the simple wealth, planning math of right.23200:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.609The Alliance: So I like, I like what you're doing. I think it's I also think it's sort of like.23300:35:09.790 --> 00:35:22.670The Alliance: probably like what you could call wealth planning for the 21st century. Right? Like it's more of a 360 degree view of that which I think is really cool. I like your.23400:35:22.730 --> 00:35:52.500The Alliance: you know. I mean, like what I, what I'm interested in is when you come back to me next time. And you're like, okay, there's like these 10 components to my exit plan. And here's the system I'm building around each and the tools that I'm building around each. And here's my plan to test this with customers, people to make sure it's gonna they're gonna work. And we're giving the results like that's when it's gonna start getting like super fun because you're gonna start being able to run. You know what I mean, like, I think if we could get you23500:35:52.610 --> 00:36:19.946The Alliance: sort of like within a month or 2, just like, what are the experiments? Okay, what are the experiments? I want to run to test some of the things I'm trying to make sure I'm gonna get my systems are, gonna get the people the results they want. Right? One of the things that you have to assume because you're a good communicator, and you care about it a lot. And you think about things like persuasion. And Mark, like you know, and the name Robert Caldini probably means something to you.23600:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.550Zoom user: Right.23700:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.570The Alliance: And so my my point is that23800:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.350The Alliance: you have to be extra careful that your systems23900:36:29.980 --> 00:36:56.300The Alliance: are as effective when you're out of the room as when you're in the room, because otherwise this shit don't scale right with expert. This is a problem I have. I'm an expert communicator. So people come to my events. Everything makes a ton of fucking sense, because I'm really great. And then they go back home with my stuff, and they don't quite know what to do unless we really engineered right like. That's why the alliance is like.24000:36:56.350 --> 00:37:24.214The Alliance: Hey, here's a big toolkit to play with. But we're really asking you to do like 3 things each month or 4 things each month, because it's like it's really gotta be contained right? So that's 1 of the things you want to look at is like how to make, how to ensure that when you're not in the room as an expert communicator, right? It still works. Or do you build an AI, you to help people through that when you're not in the room, or like any of those other like? There's lots of tools there, you just gotta.24100:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.910Zoom user: Fascinated.24200:37:27.090 --> 00:37:34.170Zoom user: That's the fascinating piece of this. I think there's a lateral thinking, a human element that's irreplaceable in this type of work.24300:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.600Zoom user: But there's also an AI piece24400:37:36.900 --> 00:37:45.849Zoom user: that speeds it up. And and you know, so you're not doing all that legwork as the human trying to figure out if you can if I can develop an AI model24500:37:46.210 --> 00:37:53.840Zoom user: that. Okay, here's your next module goes over the business owner, and they do all the work in the background. Now I'm still there to do that lateral thinking and helping them24600:37:54.090 --> 00:37:59.400Zoom user: progress this thing along, or like you said something where I'm not in the room, you know, train others.24700:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.820The Alliance: Believe.24800:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.170Zoom user: Sure.24900:38:00.170 --> 00:38:05.750The Alliance: Either, or you want a system that's going to progress. The lateral thinking, if you're not in the room right.25000:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.050Zoom user: Yes, right?25100:38:09.820 --> 00:38:28.719Zoom user: Okay. The other thing I I mean, we're out of time in both segments. But I was just. I was working with my protocols and that type of thing. So you know, I know you had said. Hey, what we really want you to do for this thing is try to get up, get up in the morning. Do the writing do that stuff right off the bat, so.25200:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.110The Alliance: For you.25300:38:30.546 --> 00:38:40.330Zoom user: Not good. I you know it's gonna take a whole reworking of of my system like I usually do my best thinking. 11 o'clock at night. That kind of thing, but I know.25400:38:40.330 --> 00:38:45.010The Alliance: Anyway. Whoa! Whoa! Time about time out time about time out I so I said, this.25500:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.139The Alliance: don't. If you're a night owl.25600:38:49.470 --> 00:39:19.050The Alliance: you want to start your. You want to tilt everything so you could actually work at night like you're in a slightly different spot. Don't fight the like. No, no, you. Wanna? The 1st rule is work in accordance with your Circadian rhythms because we're playing energy games. Do you like the problem of night owls when that like that's your sort of stuff is one you gotta like what you like. Lock your bedtime in. So you're not coming in exhausted the next day because you'll go all night, so you have to really standardize your bedtime.25700:39:19.644 --> 00:39:23.210The Alliance: You often need a reset activity25800:39:23.210 --> 00:39:30.840The Alliance: green night out, because the day will mess your mess you up right, and it'll mess with your energy levels and all that stuff so like25900:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.929The Alliance: sometimes you need, like a good transition thing like it's26000:39:35.900 --> 00:39:47.669The Alliance: microdosed creativity. I play the guitar. I meditate for 10 min, like whatever it is you get you reset. So when you jump in, you're not wasting time at the front end also, which happens.26100:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.150Zoom user: Okay.26200:39:48.150 --> 00:39:55.580The Alliance: A day. Right? So you have a focus. You have a transition ritual that helps you get in. But I don't think I mean, like.26300:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.429The Alliance: I think the like.26400:39:57.640 --> 00:40:04.978The Alliance: you just want to like a 90 min block on a north concentration at, you know, 11 o'clock at night. If that's what's gonna work for you?26500:40:05.470 --> 00:40:15.529The Alliance: and just calendar and schedule around it. Yeah, I don't like no way. Should you? Yeah. Yeah. My wife's a night out. You know what I mean. Like asking my wife to try to be creative26600:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.750The Alliance: until it's, you know.26700:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.929The Alliance: 5 or 6 or 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock. You know what I should laugh at me.26800:40:22.120 --> 00:40:46.839The Alliance: Nobody. She's not getting up. I get. I get up at 3 o'clock in the morning. Naturally, of course, I want like you know what I mean, but like you shouldn't, that would be idiotic. So yeah, don't worry about that. I mean it's from. But I will say the one question I want to ask you last question. Looking at your intake, diagnostic, your intake diagnostic, said, you must kill all distractions. So how are you on the distraction management front.26900:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.530Zoom user: Very good.27000:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.860Zoom user: Yeah, so.27100:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.200The Alliance: So you.27200:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.469Zoom user: You know. But yeah, so that that when I was talking earlier about this prerequisite thing like27300:40:55.710 --> 00:41:11.970Zoom user: Byron, Katie wrote this book back in the eighties that kind of thing about going to work on on thoughts. And so again I dove right into it. And she said, Get everything out there, and all of a sudden your brain will start to know that she's got these 5 questions like you? You have a negative thought. And is is it true.27400:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.990Zoom user: Can you absolutely know it's true? And then she goes through this work. It's just basically a mental model is what I realized after.27500:41:18.220 --> 00:41:28.329Zoom user: but went through all of that kind of stuff. And literally, now, when a thought comes in, it's just automatically going to the positive. Okay, what's good about this? What can I use out of this that type of thing. And then with27600:41:28.710 --> 00:41:39.540Zoom user: David Allen and getting things done, my organizational system is good. So I live like a comic book, you know, I go from the one square and right into the next square. So even if27700:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.909Zoom user: a client just told me hey, you know27800:41:42.150 --> 00:41:46.829Zoom user: my husband just died that kind of thing, and then I have to make a presentation in the next. I can switch27900:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.770Zoom user: really? Well that way. Yeah.28000:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.780The Alliance: Yeah, me, too. But I was a good journalist.28100:41:52.450 --> 00:41:54.250Zoom user: Yeah, yeah, I couldn't imagine.28200:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.199The Alliance: Mode. It's I mean, it's well, unfortunately.28300:41:57.360 --> 00:42:19.915The Alliance: the detachment like it causes problems in relationships like I can stay. I'm very detached. I've always I'm a writer. Everything is. Is this like it's, I have 2 lives like, there's the. This is happening to me in the oh, this is going to great. Make great material for a story sometime. You know what I mean like. It's a it's the dual. It's the dual thing. So I sort of know that.28400:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.015The Alliance: what28500:42:29.780 --> 00:42:37.910The Alliance: It seems like you've got your so your thoughts and your organizational principles are already dialed.28600:42:38.260 --> 00:42:43.529The Alliance: Distraction isn't a problem. Is recovery recovery solid for you or no.28700:42:44.130 --> 00:42:55.459Zoom user: Yeah, very good. Yeah. I've been. So I'm doing strength training. So I last year I hired a trainer to. I want to get into the they call it the 55, 4, 3 Club.28800:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.779Zoom user: So it's 50 year old who can28900:42:57.930 --> 00:43:05.570Zoom user: deadlift 500 pounds, squat, 400 and bench 300. So we we're working towards that.29000:43:05.570 --> 00:43:06.450The Alliance: Me29100:43:07.390 --> 00:43:20.739The Alliance: is this is this? Wait, I know I mean I'm strong as shit, but I weigh 150 pounds like my bench is like, I get 2, 35 up. I don't know how the hell I get to 3.29200:43:21.120 --> 00:43:27.439The Alliance: yeah. Same same problem with squatting. I can get to 329300:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.109The Alliance: 2 50 is where I, Max, I probably could get.29400:43:32.420 --> 00:43:39.319The Alliance: I might be able to get to 3. I don't know how I'm gonna get to 4 for me and 500. What do I have to? I've got a deadlift 500.29500:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.110Zoom user: Yeah.29600:43:40.110 --> 00:43:44.550The Alliance: Jesus, though you guys are, I'm off by a hundred pounds in every category. Damn it.29700:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.210The Alliance: this is none of these systems are built for small guys.29800:43:50.451 --> 00:43:58.180Zoom user: Well, and it's it. It works perfect for me in the sense that I mean, it's something that I have to like. We're at a stage now where my trainers like, hey.29900:43:58.470 --> 00:44:04.060Zoom user: you, you know I'm I'm deadlifting. I think my is 4, 35 is my best. He still we got30000:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.200Zoom user: that's so great.30100:44:05.870 --> 00:44:22.430Zoom user: Yeah, we got 65 pounds to go. You're not getting there unless we change your protein intake and those kind of things. So now it's a lot of fun because we're getting really dialed in. And so the recovery activities I do that 3 days a week, and then the recovery activities. I've always been a biker like I love road biking30200:44:22.570 --> 00:44:46.130Zoom user: that type of thing. So that's easy. In the summer. In Canada. In the winter it's more challenging. But we picked up these skis that are. We went out and did this skiing where they've got these new skis that are like they're built for like both cross country, and they're a little bit wider. They're a ton of fun. So we're kind of putting in some winter activities like that kind of thing. So recovery seems to be good. Yeah.30300:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.810Zoom user: And I'm tracking, tracking everything through the loop. Yeah.30400:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.350The Alliance: Through the world.30500:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.390Zoom user: Mom.30600:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.930The Alliance: Awesome.30700:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.879The Alliance: Yeah, I like, I I'm out of. You're on point30800:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.589The Alliance: on all, on all your stuff. I think.30900:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.880Zoom user: I think.31000:45:11.140 --> 00:45:25.529Zoom user: yeah. And it's you know what I mean. At the end of the day I think I've got over the the point to where? Because I've always said to my clients, Hey, people overestimate what they can achieve in a year, but they underestimate what they can achieve in a decade, and the decade is going to come by.31100:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.760Zoom user: Now I'm starting to think about I'm 51 I still got.31200:45:29.990 --> 00:45:36.810Zoom user: you know. And when you said earlier in the call today. The Mtp. Can actually be something that's, you know, 5 to 6 years.31300:45:37.140 --> 00:45:53.879Zoom user: Well, it seems like I've got that. I've got the boys coming into the business. I've got the business owner thing. Run with that as an Mtp. Arrive at the gates of 55, 56, and who knows where it goes from. There. Maybe the program is built to a place where maybe I'm taking that nationally, or something like that, or.31400:45:53.880 --> 00:46:08.499The Alliance: Something like that. I yeah, I think you just you just like it's got it. I mean, you keep coming back to suck your teeth into it like I just like dark to crystallize, make it make it realer and realer and real, and see what? See what we learn along the way. I think that's that makes a lot of sense as a plan.31500:46:09.300 --> 00:46:09.745Zoom user: Awesome.31600:46:10.690 --> 00:46:11.010The Alliance: Alright!31700:46:11.010 --> 00:46:11.400Zoom user: Okay.31800:46:12.433 --> 00:46:20.040The Alliance: And are you? Are we gonna see you in San Francisco in June for the June?31900:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.433The Alliance: No, okay.32000:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.610Zoom user: Yeah.32100:46:24.980 --> 00:46:30.030The Alliance: Awesome. Then I will see you on our next group call and June sounds good.32200:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.149The Alliance: Check it all right.32300:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.100Zoom user: Awesome. Alright! Take care! Have a great day! Thanks, bye.32400:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.089The Alliance: You too, bye.
