WEBVTT100:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.089The Alliance: Rico, are ya?200:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.520Rick Sessinghaus: Fantastic. How are you, Stu?300:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.870The Alliance: Good, thanks.400:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.820Rick Sessinghaus: Good, good, good.500:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.300The Alliance: I'm good, thanks. So, … what are we doing today?600:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.600Rick Sessinghaus: Alright, well, I got a list of, questions and comments and updates. So, …700:01:28.510 --> 00:01:43.299Rick Sessinghaus: From an update standpoint on my end, I have felt, you know, the last 3-4 months have been trying to do 3 full-time jobs at the same time, and now I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. PGA Tour season finished yesterday, …800:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.990Rick Sessinghaus: there's a chance my player's gonna make the Ryder Cup, so maybe in a few weeks, I'll be with him there, but there's now…900:01:50.270 --> 00:02:04.610Rick Sessinghaus: I can now exhale on that. I already have my own coaching career, and then the other thing that kind of derailed a lot of this is opening up this indoor facility here in Burbank, California, which has been1000:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.720Rick Sessinghaus: Time-consuming, but it's been very, …1100:02:07.720 --> 00:02:31.549Rick Sessinghaus: fulfilling. We got the keys on August 1st, and we're gonna be open this Saturday. So we've got a 2,000 square foot place that has two golf simulators, has a music studio, has a lobby that I'm gonna have my brainwave stuff in, and it's just been working my ass off. My wife and my daughter and the contractors have been fantastic.1200:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.029Rick Sessinghaus: And so… on that, I'm gonna use that for a little bit of things here, is…1300:02:38.330 --> 00:02:53.089Rick Sessinghaus: we talked about clear goals, and one of the great advice you gave me on our first call was this idea of kind of, like, the hundred steps, or kind of reverse engineering and stuff. And at the time, when I first got in the program, it was a lot of this AI stuff that I'm still working on, by the way, but…1400:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.090Rick Sessinghaus: now it became all-encompassing of getting the studio done, which kind of fell in my lap, whatever, 45 days ago or so. And…1500:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.120Rick Sessinghaus: Creating that goal list, … made it…1600:03:08.820 --> 00:03:22.610Rick Sessinghaus: I don't know if I say I'm gonna be really flowy, but I would say the productivity of what needed to get done, when it needed to get done, created urgency, but the clarity of it, really helped the dominoes fall in the correct order.1700:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.750Rick Sessinghaus: Okay? Now, you could have a contractor that doesn't show up one day. That… I'm not really… that's not what I'm talking… it's talking about, like, what do I need to do today?1800:03:30.920 --> 00:03:47.169Rick Sessinghaus: And then being really clear, because my wife and I say, nope, we have to do this, this, this, this, that. Now, me, who likes to be the visionary, would love to do the fun stuff, and jump over here, and then yesterday, we spent 6 hours putting furniture together. But it had to be done, because the carpet's being installed tomorrow. So.1900:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.449Rick Sessinghaus: it just zoomed back out, is that I need to do more of that in my weekly, life.2000:03:53.710 --> 00:04:02.889Rick Sessinghaus: And having those clear goals, yes, they might have to adapt here and there, has been very important. And the other thing which I wanted to talk to you about the…2100:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.610Rick Sessinghaus: The word urgency.2200:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.199Rick Sessinghaus: I tend to use urgency a little too much in my life. It has to get done, and I do do it.2300:04:12.700 --> 00:04:22.389Rick Sessinghaus: I don't get distracted, but it's back to, well, is this really urgent or not, would be another question. And so I found that with project management of this, is2400:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.770Rick Sessinghaus: Having clear goals on the studio.2500:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.909Rick Sessinghaus: there was always urgency tapped in, and I think it really narrowed me to not get distracted on other things.2600:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.869Rick Sessinghaus: So, I'll take a quick breath as I let you respond.2700:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.279The Alliance: Let me just ask you a couple of clarifying questions. When are you setting your clear goals for the day?2800:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.660The Alliance: When?2900:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.600The Alliance: Rick.3000:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.290Rick Sessinghaus: So, it happens two spots. So, it happens on Sundays. So, my wife and I, last night, we… we paid the bills, we looked at, okay, …3100:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.319Rick Sessinghaus: what's gonna happen this day, this day, this day? We have to talk to the… so there was a Sunday for the week.3200:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.210Rick Sessinghaus: then… so I already had Mondays basically taken care of, which was today.3300:05:06.380 --> 00:05:19.329Rick Sessinghaus: I will, at the end of the evening, then check in with her, because she's kind of the project manager. Okay, what do we do? So there's been a feedback loop at the end of the day that's been a hell of a lot better, but I think the Sunday3400:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.419Rick Sessinghaus: Who does what has been, pivotal towards the success, too.3500:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.330The Alliance: And you say you could use it more in your daily life. What does that look like? What would that look like for you?3600:05:35.910 --> 00:05:45.529Rick Sessinghaus: it would look… it would look like… well, time blocking ahead of time, I think, would be one thing, too. It's not just listing, here's 12 things I want to do, here's an open-ended calendar.3700:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.860Rick Sessinghaus: It would be…3800:05:47.290 --> 00:05:59.010Rick Sessinghaus: to dump that into Time Block 1, Time Block 2. Yes, I have my clients that are… I pretty much know my schedule, probably 72 hours in advance. …3900:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.140Rick Sessinghaus: It's using the time blocks more effectively.4000:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.340Rick Sessinghaus: And putting the goal within the time block, instead of just saying, okay, here's your list of 6 things to do today. ….4100:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.590The Alliance: Oh yeah, by the way, I, … so…4200:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.930The Alliance: personal, like, literally. So, I have been consumed.4300:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.729The Alliance: with this new novel. And mind you, it's…4400:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.380The Alliance: Been rejected by 18 publishers, along the way.4500:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.909The Alliance: Which, to me, was a very expensive way of getting feedback, really.4600:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.640Rick Sessinghaus: It's like….4700:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.830The Alliance: It gave me great feedback, but it was a very expensive round of feedback, but, … it…4800:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.709The Alliance: There's a future farther out, where…4900:06:45.680 --> 00:07:05.180The Alliance: there's minimal coaching that I'm doing, other than probably, like, an ongoing alliance and, like, one new group a year kind of thing, other than, and research, and I want to write fiction. But fiction has not paid the bills so far. It's my future plan, so it's… but I love it, and the puzzles are…5000:07:05.850 --> 00:07:22.609The Alliance: consuming, like, 12 hours can go by, and I'll look up, and I'll be like… that was yesterday. I literally looked up, and I was like, holy shit, I started at 3 o'clock in the morning, it's 4 o'clock, I think I had some oatmeal somewhere along the way, what happened in my day? And I was like, Steven, you've got5100:07:22.840 --> 00:07:36.109The Alliance: shit do. Like, you just, like, what happened in 3 days? Like, all the stuff I was gonna catch up on in the week, and I… so I went through my calendar this week, and literally, like, between this meeting and the next meeting, and that, right, I put in5200:07:36.720 --> 00:07:48.270The Alliance: write this speech here. I had to. I normally can get some wiggle room, but my schedule, because I'm doing the same thing you, I'm basically running 3 companies at this moment, until I'm almost 4, and…5300:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.219The Alliance: I was like, oh, I gotta, like, I actually have to take my game up.5400:07:52.220 --> 00:08:09.929The Alliance: because my schedule has gotten more rigorous, and it's… like, the old stuff, as effective as it was, it's no… I actually like my own medicine, I gotta drink my own medicine, and, like, really… so, same thing, I'm seeing it in my life, too, because of the… and the other thing that I have done, that I have found.5500:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.060The Alliance: So you, like, I… have my goals, right? And first goal is always.5600:08:15.060 --> 00:08:34.820The Alliance: writing, because it pays the bills and is my soul. Flow research second, and then make the world a better place for animals, which is sort of very tied into my wife, and, like, I think our marriage is sort of in that one a little bit, too. But, like, that's my priority list. When I look at, like, my calendar block, my weeks, and my days, because of how my energy goes.5700:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.300The Alliance: I know that's gotta be the order of the days, so, like.5800:08:40.710 --> 00:09:00.299The Alliance: You know what I mean. Yes, I take the dogs for a walk early, but, like, the stuff I do around the sanctuary and whatever, it's at 5… when everything else is done, then… then I… dog stuff kind of thing. So when I… you talk about urgency, one of the ways, and then I'll shut up, I think about it, is I have 3…5900:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.240The Alliance: you could call… like, I'll use the term massively transformative purposes, because I know that, like, those are actually, like, submissions, right? They're gonna be…6000:09:09.240 --> 00:09:30.429The Alliance: Right, hard, hard goals kind of thing. But, like, most people, when they go to set massively transformative purposes, get hung up, because they think it's gotta last for the rest of their life, and I think that's silly, because you're gonna grow. Your purpose is going to change, right? Like, unless you haven't… unless you're not doing the work, then we've got a different problem, right? But if you're gonna… if you've got a… if you… like, it's… so I don't love…6100:09:31.050 --> 00:09:37.429The Alliance: things that are too giant, but I… you know what I mean in that way. But anyways, my point is.6200:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.289The Alliance: Having, like… like, if you… you would ask yourself, okay.6300:09:42.290 --> 00:10:00.320The Alliance: coaching business, more important or less important than AI Studio and that, you know what I mean? Like, that's the… and I'm not saying that you don't hit each of those each day, but I'm talking about, from a human motivation standpoint, I have found that if you don't check off the big dream first.6400:10:00.330 --> 00:10:18.039The Alliance: you notice it all day long, right? And so, I always… like, I think about almost everything in terms of urgency, but I also think about cognitive load. What's its load on my soul? And that's the… that's really the metric I'm looking for. So, like.6500:10:18.160 --> 00:10:34.290The Alliance: for example, when I'm setting my clear goals, I try to set the challenge-skills balance at the same time, right? Like, so write 500 words today, that's the goal, but 500 words fits my energy level, where I'm at, blah blah, that sort of stuff, and it goes first.6600:10:34.290 --> 00:10:52.010The Alliance: Because if I don't accomplish that and I get to the end of my day, I'm going to be mad at myself that I didn't hit my primary, and so I… I use my own sort of soul to guide me, and when I drift too much, I'm like, okay, you've drifted, you're too indulging into soul projects.6700:10:52.130 --> 00:10:57.519The Alliance: next two days, get, like, that you just work… did that make any sense? Does that help at all?6800:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.359Rick Sessinghaus: Certainly, and I think… it's… … So, as I…6900:11:04.720 --> 00:11:14.699Rick Sessinghaus: find… or I try to train more flow, or I take care of myself fairly well, is that my energy levels very, very high? That…7000:11:14.840 --> 00:11:34.040Rick Sessinghaus: back to challenge skills balance, I keep pushing challenges, and pushing, pushing, because I go, well, I could do it, right? But you said cognitive load, and that's been kind of my kryptonite, this summer, is, yes, I can push through, and I can do it, but by the end of that day, the cognitive load has interfered with7100:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.389Rick Sessinghaus: Being a better coach, or making better decisions, or being creative, and…7200:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.509Rick Sessinghaus: So that's where it's like, when we talk about challenge skills.7300:11:41.770 --> 00:11:48.560Rick Sessinghaus: if somebody says, oh, do you have the energy? I go, I got the physical energy all day long. That's not a problem. But then I found, like, wow.7400:11:48.740 --> 00:12:00.760Rick Sessinghaus: the cognitive load was getting so great that I found that my emotional resiliency was low, I found that my creative endeavors weren't the same, and I'm like, oh, that's the challenge, not the energy. The challenge is that.7500:12:00.760 --> 00:12:14.529The Alliance: Yeah, I think Jim Swarks led people astray, as much as I loved his work on energy. I thought it was a very necessary part of the conversation. I'm really glad he came in, but it ignored7600:12:14.530 --> 00:12:23.790The Alliance: the foundational limit, which is cognitive load. We have way… if you're in shape, if you're eating well, if you're doing this stuff, you've got the… and if you're…7700:12:23.790 --> 00:12:37.260The Alliance: a hustler, you've got the energy. Where I, like, Rick, I won't go bore you with details, and this is… so this is one thing that I will tell you. This is what I… this is why cognitive load matters so much. I tell people, like.7800:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.940The Alliance: Cognitive load management is really actually about anti-fragility, and the reason is this.7900:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.919The Alliance: You have the energy, and you have the cognitive load when everything goes right.8000:12:48.100 --> 00:13:00.710The Alliance: But when things go wrong, and life happens, right? They're always gonna go wrong, you don't… if you don't have the space built in your schedule, you literally aren't gonna bounce back. So, like, last month.8100:13:00.950 --> 00:13:08.009The Alliance: I was flying, everything was great. Those 18 publishers started rejecting the book, my dad got sick.8200:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.460The Alliance: And, like, 3 other… my house, like, a bunch of plumbing stuff.8300:13:12.870 --> 00:13:24.850The Alliance: exploded because they killed the power in town because of lightning, and, like, just a bad… like, they killed the power at the worst time possible, and I have everything on a generator except8400:13:25.230 --> 00:13:33.179The Alliance: for this… this system, and it exploded, right? I had… so suddenly I was like… and my wife was pissed because I was pissed, you know what I mean? Like…8500:13:33.180 --> 00:13:50.249The Alliance: So suddenly I had a problem at home, my wife, I had a problem with my father, I had a problem with, like, major repairs going on, and I had a problem with my business, and I turned into a raging asshole for a month. And I did. And, I fucked up my marriage and had to fix that.8600:13:50.250 --> 00:14:06.680The Alliance: And still, like, you know, my relationship with one of my co-writers on a book that we're in the middle of, because he abused my time, I went fucking nuts. And I was right, but I didn't have to go nuts, and now we've got that problem, rather than, you know, me just being like, dude.8700:14:06.720 --> 00:14:16.790The Alliance: I respect your schedule, you've got to respect my schedule, what are you doing? Right? That would have solved the problem, and instead I was like, fuck you, man, you know, what are you doing to me?8800:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.789Rick Sessinghaus: I have rights! Totally. So, when you talk about…8900:14:24.270 --> 00:14:31.750Rick Sessinghaus: So, and I think the answer's very obvious as I ask the question, but how does one manage cognitive load?9000:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.730The Alliance: So, here's… here's the flat, like, hardcore truth about cognitive load.9100:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.040The Alliance: Boom.9200:14:39.390 --> 00:14:44.739The Alliance: it… The human cognitive load system taps out after four concepts.9300:14:44.900 --> 00:14:52.499The Alliance: Like, so you can hold 4 big things in your head for a day at max, and then you're tapped. …9400:14:52.610 --> 00:15:11.800The Alliance: you can do more, but you have to reset the system. So, mindfulness, a walk-in day, some, right, even a little bit of creative microdosing, it's not gonna clear out all four, you're gonna have residual, but if you've got a break in there, you can usually clear one or two.9500:15:11.800 --> 00:15:18.239The Alliance: and sort of come back to it. Otherwise, you're just redlined. The other thing that is really important9600:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.430The Alliance: to me, and you're gonna have your own. So, for me.9700:15:22.520 --> 00:15:29.280The Alliance: where I was most vulnerable, I realized, was I could power through my fucking day. But I would go across the…9800:15:29.330 --> 00:15:46.799The Alliance: way to my home at 5 o'clock, and my wife would start telling me all the things that had to be done, and I would… either I would lose it then, or usually I would keep it to myself and go, like, back into my office and lose it then, right? And so we now have a rule, which is…9900:15:46.800 --> 00:16:04.009The Alliance: you have to text me during the day the stuff that you need done, so it doesn't come in like a fire hose, because I'm gonna have a bad reaction, and I don't actually have… you need me to leave everything on the table work-wise, because that's how we pay for this shit.10000:16:04.010 --> 00:16:28.609The Alliance: So you have to understand that I only need one thing, which is I want to help you, but if you come at me with five things, I don't have the RAM to hold it. So literally, you're just going to overload my system. I'm not going to get it anyways, and you're not going to get the reaction from me. You want… what you need is to send me the stuff, let me look at it, figure out how I can slot it in, and then I will come back to you with a report of this, this, and this, and this. Is that in the right10100:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.680The Alliance: Right order for you, kind of thing.10200:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.400Rick Sessinghaus: Got it.10300:16:31.400 --> 00:16:46.440The Alliance: And it has helped a lot. That was my vulnerability. We all have our, sort of, like, breaking points, you know what I mean? I've also found that the other thing that did go with it, and this… I'm just gonna say it, because this is me, it may not be you.10400:16:46.640 --> 00:16:54.669The Alliance: I'm a nice guy. And as a nice guy, oftentimes people don't hear me when I'm giving them deadlines or boundaries.10500:16:54.980 --> 00:17:15.359The Alliance: So, I have learned that I speak very… I go into robot mode. Like, literally, like, this is Annie Lala's advice, this is my friend Jody's advice also, because they're both excellent communicators, and I'm like, fuck, I don't have the time for this, and I can't have the cognitive load, because if you come back to me later with something undone.10600:17:15.450 --> 00:17:26.469The Alliance: oh my god, you just crushed me, right? So, like, I was… to me, it was my wife piling on at the end of the day, not clear boundaries, not clear, …10700:17:26.800 --> 00:17:40.860The Alliance: deadlines, and once I started over… Jody says this all the time, over-communicate, over-communicate, over-communicate. And so I… I do it now, and it makes me feel like a fucking robot.10800:17:41.010 --> 00:17:46.499The Alliance: But it preserves my cognitive load. So that's the, like, right, it's the trade-off, and….10900:17:48.500 --> 00:18:12.009Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, no, yeah, I think, nice guy, definitely, I think, falls into what I do, and then, lack of boundaries. So, the, you know, like, I just came off, we have, 180 certified, coaches in our golf, platform, and so now I do these, these monthly calls, and, you know, five of them are like, yeah, I'll, you know, I'll get a call with you, and then we'll talk about, it's like.11000:18:12.320 --> 00:18:23.389Rick Sessinghaus: no, that's not actually how this is supposed to work. This is group, kind of like, you know, what we're doing, and I have assistants that'll help you on that, but then I find myself, oh, okay, it's like… and that's.11100:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.050The Alliance: Yeah, so….11200:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.350Rick Sessinghaus: That's frickin' on me.11300:18:25.350 --> 00:18:34.209The Alliance: what I… yeah, I mean, this is like… so at the beginning of the alliance. This is… I, like… and this is an issue I'm gonna have to do again more effectively next time, which is…11400:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.340The Alliance: I am not here as your collaborator. That's not what we're selling.11500:18:38.340 --> 00:19:02.729The Alliance: Right? Like, we may develop a relationship, and we might end up working together, but I guarantee you it's going to be long after the end of the alliance, because I don't work with people I don't know really, really well, because I've got enough friends, basically. I don't need another collaborator. Unless you have, like, really prestigious PhD in neuroscience after your name, and then I'm going to write a paper with you, and that's an easy collaboration, right? That fits into a slot.11600:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.720The Alliance: I have a slot for you. But, like, the other stuff I don't, and it's…11700:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.140The Alliance: you know, I noticed at the beginning of the alliance, because there's, like, 3 or 4 people who.11800:19:12.140 --> 00:19:21.179Rick Sessinghaus: didn't hear that, because they didn't want to hear it, and now I'm having coaching sessions with them where I'm like, I'm trying to help you. I don't want to collaborate with you. Stop.11900:19:21.450 --> 00:19:31.600The Alliance: thinking that way, this is… right? So, like, I have come to realize that with my clients, I really have to be very, very clear. I do it at the beginning of the flow for writers, like.12000:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.929The Alliance: which is the first time I had to get great at, where I was like, don't come to me for an agent.12100:19:35.950 --> 00:19:52.920The Alliance: I will not give you my agent. It's the hardest thing in the field. I can't help you. My agent is old, he's retiring, he doesn't want to work with you, he doesn't like you. He doesn't want me to tell you about him, he's just gonna reject your book, and then I'm gonna get punished for wasting his time. Like, I do a long speech about my boundary.12200:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.550Rick Sessinghaus: Right.12300:19:53.550 --> 00:20:05.870The Alliance: It's this big speech, because otherwise, everybody wanted me to give them my agent a blurb their book, and I literally, like, blurbs are traded by publishing houses. I don't have control of my blurbs.12400:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.880The Alliance: Like, are you kidding? And if I blurb too many books, my publisher is fucking furious, because it's currency.12500:20:10.880 --> 00:20:27.420The Alliance: So, like, I… like, you're… you're trying to spend currency that I don't even own, but you don't know enough to get that, right? So, like, I… you know, all… I really over-communicate those things to my coaching clients, otherwise there's drift. My big problem.12600:20:27.590 --> 00:20:33.069The Alliance: even in these cl… I… I feel bad getting off the call in a half an hour.12700:20:33.350 --> 00:20:46.470The Alliance: I want to, like, every call has to be 45 minutes or an hour, because I like the people I'm talking to. Same as you. I like my clients, you know what I mean? They're cool, they do great shit in the world, I want to help them, and… but, like.12800:20:46.990 --> 00:20:59.870The Alliance: if you don't draw… try to draw the boundaries, everybody is gonna hear what they want, and do what they… right? So, like… and the truth of the matter is, this is drilled into me over and over again, and I'll shut up.12900:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.240The Alliance: There's a different… nice is not useful.13000:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.469The Alliance: Clear is actually nice.13100:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.060Rick Sessinghaus: Hmm.13200:21:08.720 --> 00:21:19.099The Alliance: It's nice from guys like us, in the situations we're in, set up expectations that we're not gonna meet. So you literally are just gonna disappoint them later, and that's a bigger problem.13300:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.540Rick Sessinghaus: 100%. Not that….13400:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.210The Alliance: Right.13500:21:21.210 --> 00:21:26.120Rick Sessinghaus: Great advice. And that's the shift I've had to gone into a little bit more.13600:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.690The Alliance: Oh, dude, it's hard. I can commiserate. Anytime you want to commiserate on this one, I'm with you, because, like.13700:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.889The Alliance: I know it, too!13800:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.000Rick Sessinghaus: … So, I….13900:21:37.000 --> 00:21:50.989The Alliance: I want to tell you, just as a side note, this is not relevant, but before I forget, just so you know, and I didn't know that, I just found out this, there's a book, it's coming out by an Italian dude who claims he's a performance14000:21:51.120 --> 00:22:00.479The Alliance: psychologist, and a project manager of some kind, but he's putting out a book on the flow of tennis. And he said he's got, like, 10 or 15 years of research.14100:22:00.480 --> 00:22:15.259The Alliance: Going, and he just asked me, it seems very academic, but I've, like, I've been waiting, you know what I mean? I'm like, you know, what's his name's book on golf? Golf flow is very mediocre, not bad, Gino's book. Yeah.14200:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.859Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, Joe was like, yeah.14300:22:16.860 --> 00:22:30.219The Alliance: Yeah, who I really like, and I like him. But it's really old, and what's his name in Australia? Sooner or later, he's gonna write a book on golf, but he doesn't know what he's talking about. Christian Swan, he's the other big golfer.14400:22:30.220 --> 00:22:45.640Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, I love… I've loved his research, for sure. So, that's a good segue, because one, my company is getting into more verticals, tennis being one of them. We have a performance coach, and then we have, we have some other14500:22:46.110 --> 00:22:53.800Rick Sessinghaus: people who are, like, gonna help us with that. So this is kind of a two-step kind of question.14600:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.520Rick Sessinghaus: One, what you did with FRC, which, again, I've taken14700:22:59.550 --> 00:23:05.589Rick Sessinghaus: at least 3 of the classes, right? From Zero to Dangerous to Leadership. I mean, so again, loved it, the coaching end of it.14800:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.760Rick Sessinghaus: And I know you've now… you're transitioning out of it, I know it exists, but it's not active, right?14900:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.629Rick Sessinghaus: Our company is…15000:23:12.830 --> 00:23:22.650Rick Sessinghaus: similar, okay? We're not going into the business space as aggressively as you did as far as corporate yet. We're doing more sports-based stuff, a little bit of education.15100:23:23.900 --> 00:23:32.679Rick Sessinghaus: And you can answer this as short as if you want. If you did that over, what would you have done anything differently? Because we're looking at scalability….15200:23:32.680 --> 00:23:41.520The Alliance: A ton of shit different, like, a ton of shit differently. I would have… One.15300:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.100The Alliance: Not hired superstars to move my first round of coaches, big mistake.15400:23:46.700 --> 00:24:05.499The Alliance: Big mistake. They did their stuff, not my stuff. Their names were amazing. I had the greatest, like, I'm on my roster, like, you would literally go, wow, these are the 10 heaviest hitters in the world today. They did their stuff and not my stuff, and it was a disaster. So, that's one.15500:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.669The Alliance: Two, I'll do it quick, I'll try to go quickly. Two,15600:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.779The Alliance: Definitely, for sure, do not expect curriculum to be locked.15700:24:17.130 --> 00:24:22.260The Alliance: So, I came in after working the best of the best, And then we went wide.15800:24:22.300 --> 00:24:30.420The Alliance: And the gap between what you have to tell best to the best versus what you had to tell normal people was enormous. So literally.15900:24:30.420 --> 00:24:46.389The Alliance: We got… we got a month and a half into our first training and went, we're gonna go out of business. Our clients aren't getting it, they don't understand, we need to hold their hand. We had to quadruple the content. Do you know why Zero to Dangerous has so much Rian in it?16000:24:46.580 --> 00:24:57.909The Alliance: Because we literally had 2 weeks to save the company, and he sat down into a studio and recorded all of those modules in 2 weeks while I did the back end. Yeah, that's what happened.16100:24:58.250 --> 00:25:08.920The Alliance: So, like, big lesson there. Big lesson. Expect your curriculum to break early on as you scale into different people. The next thing I will tell you16200:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.329The Alliance: Most importantly, most importantly.16300:25:13.060 --> 00:25:21.009The Alliance: if I could do it again, every decision I would have made would have been based… I would have done two things differently. One.16400:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.659The Alliance: You have to have a way to seed the front end of the pipe, always, to bring in bodies.16500:25:27.660 --> 00:25:27.990Rick Sessinghaus: That's right.16600:25:27.990 --> 00:25:44.859The Alliance: we… I was publishing crazy amounts of stuff, but we were only capitalizing as marketers on the books, because I didn't have the team that knew how to promote the studies, the other stuff. How do you take a neuroscience study and get as much attention as a book?16700:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.300Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.16800:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.709The Alliance: you can do it, but we didn't have the team to do it, and I…16900:25:48.850 --> 00:25:53.019The Alliance: I thought, oh, what does it matter, blah blah blah, but then there was the couple of years where, like.17000:25:53.150 --> 00:26:11.989The Alliance: Now, our country was very specific. If you knew my work, you loved it, it was dope, right? But it didn't go wide right away, it went wide. It's slowly still going, so we didn't get the lift we expected from it, and we… so we didn't have… the front end of the pipe started to wobble, and we started to deal with way more cold traffic.17100:26:12.080 --> 00:26:28.999The Alliance: So you have to keep… you have to keep… if your business is running on X bodies in your thing a month, you gotta have that pipe. That front end of the pipe has to have a lot of attention, and for me, what I found, this is the key that I was trying to get to.17200:26:29.430 --> 00:26:47.789The Alliance: You will hire… it is very easy to hire a marketing team, but they're short-sighted. They can only see what's in front of them. They're gonna do one challenge at a time. They cannot hold… they are not literally physical… that's what a publicist does. A publicist can hold the long-term vision, and we didn't spend on a publicist, and it was dumb.17300:26:47.990 --> 00:26:56.250The Alliance: was dumb, because nobody was caring, and I would have… I probably would… that company would still exist, or have been sold, had we done that.17400:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.680Rick Sessinghaus: Hmm.17500:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.979The Alliance: So, that was a real issue. And the last one, and then I'll shut up, is…17600:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.930The Alliance: every time somebody came to me and said, we need to hire X,17700:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.999The Alliance: I needed to stop and go, okay.17800:27:12.000 --> 00:27:34.650The Alliance: But what is the cost to manage X? What is the cost if I want to pivot the business? What do I do with X? What do I… how much freedom am I giving up to get this job done? Like, I know it's really easy, and… because what happens is… and here's what you don't want to do, because you cannot do it and juggle the careers that you were trying to juggle, you can't have a staff of 100.17900:27:34.650 --> 00:27:41.619The Alliance: it won't work. It's too much. You gotta… so, like, the easy solution that everybody wants is hire.18000:27:41.770 --> 00:27:57.189The Alliance: And you have to stop and go, no, how do I do this internally? Can AI do this? How do we not add a body? How do I not add cognitive load? Because that was the killer. We would go… I would go to these fucking Monday meetings.18100:27:57.190 --> 00:28:10.890The Alliance: And there'd be 100 people on the meeting, and I didn't know 30 of them, and… because they were… they were new the past month, and I was like, oh my god, I gotta meet all these 30 people, because we have turnover in the marketers and the sales team, like… Right.18200:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.610The Alliance: I gotta meet these people.18300:28:12.610 --> 00:28:31.380The Alliance: make sure they know what they're talking about. I gotta, like, sometime in their first 3 months of the company, you've gotta talk to the CEO, otherwise you're aiming, right? All of that, and I was like, holy fuck, nobody, like, it doesn't sound like a lot, but when you have 100 people and you're trying to touch everybody in your organization who's been there for at least 3 months.18400:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.000Rick Sessinghaus: Right, like, once every… even once every 3 months. Yeah.18500:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.060The Alliance: Awesome.18600:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.899The Alliance: It's not, like, especially if you don't have a physical office where everybody's coming.18700:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.260Rick Sessinghaus: Totally.18800:28:40.260 --> 00:28:51.940The Alliance: Yeah. Like, you cannot… there's no way to actually steer the ship, and what happens is, your culture, your brand… like, I shut… when I… when I went, fuck it, I'm done.18900:28:52.000 --> 00:29:04.370The Alliance: is when, over the… it was Flow for Writers, and we finished the Flow for Writers, and, like, 7 people, individually, not at once, came up to me and went, dude, you're nothing like your marketing.19000:29:04.630 --> 00:29:10.020The Alliance: And what I realized was, the marketing had tilted so much to get cold traffic.19100:29:10.500 --> 00:29:22.530The Alliance: And they didn't know me at all. Oh. It was no longer me. I was no longer, like, and so I was coming into public, people were expecting, like, an arrogant… like, they had turned me into something, like, arrogant and bland.19200:29:22.910 --> 00:29:41.429The Alliance: like, not only was it not working, but for the… when the customers did come in, there was a disjoint, and they felt wobbly, and I was like, fuck this, there's gotta be a… there's gotta be something I can do, because this is not sustainable, right? If I'm the fucking brand, and you guys have the brand wrong, me wrong entirely.19300:29:41.750 --> 00:29:57.840The Alliance: we're… this is not gonna work. I'm an edgy punk rock motherfucker. You… you sell me as, like, cocky brand… like, cocky and arrogant. I'm like a European intellectual, you know what I mean? And, like, you're gonna come into a workshop with me and be really freaked.19400:29:57.840 --> 00:30:10.870Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense now, looking back. I mean, I viewed you as the punk rocker, because I had… I had done… I had listened to so much stuff that you'd been on, and I had seen you speak, you know, so… but I can see that….19500:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.630The Alliance: didn't know when you came in cold traffic from what they were doing. You see the problem, right?19600:30:16.070 --> 00:30:32.619Rick Sessinghaus: I know the last question, and we might not have time, is I want to pressure test, so I am writing another book, and, I think I told you, called The Round of Your Life, and 19 chapters, and using golf as a metaphor for, for life, and stuff like that.19700:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.819Rick Sessinghaus: You mentioned this in before in one of our classes about kind of pressure testing stuff.19800:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.700The Alliance: … Yep. Now.19900:30:39.950 --> 00:30:54.600Rick Sessinghaus: I have a book coach who is a golfer, and then I have my partner in my company who knows more of the science, and they can read it, all that. Is there any other ideas that you would say for pressure testing the book?20000:30:54.600 --> 00:31:09.809The Alliance: Yeah, so one, I'll give you… I'll do… I'll make the introduction if you want afterwards. I've got a friend… this is exactly what I do. So I have an editor I work with at my publishing house, who I don't trust at all, because they don't actually have my instincts at heart. They have20100:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.279The Alliance: Right, and they… and, like, I've got the editor with Peter, for example.20200:31:15.620 --> 00:31:24.909The Alliance: this is very typical, so this is the emphasis. And I have a… I can give you an extra 5-10 minutes, I don't have to run just yet, it's fine. Thank you.20300:31:25.210 --> 00:31:36.910The Alliance: she's got… she's got kids, and she's really a proud mom, and, like, right now, that's her phase she's going through, and so, like, we were writing about mindset, and I was writing, like, I was literally, like…20400:31:37.160 --> 00:32:02.140The Alliance: mindset is, you know… and she started editing it to put in all kinds of opinions about moms and child-rearing that literally, like… I was like, honey, this is really sweet, but you're now conflicting with the neuroscience, and this is your own fucking opinion. Like, literally, those things are not true about mindset, but it's nice, it's sweet, but not true about mindset. So my point is, you can't… like, editors are given like everybody else.20500:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.430The Alliance: and they will have stuff like that, so I don't always trust the publishing house.20600:32:06.430 --> 00:32:15.810The Alliance: I have my editor, who I work with on a daily… on a weekly basis, and then I got a guy named Chip Hopper, who runs a company called Book Jedi. He's sometimes a ghostwriter.20700:32:16.500 --> 00:32:28.200The Alliance: And he's okay, I like him as a ghostwriter. I don't think he's the best out there, because he hasn't… he doesn't… the best ghostwriters I know are the guys with magazine jobs. He doesn't have them.20800:32:28.200 --> 00:32:39.839The Alliance: But he's a very anal editor, so I have him… I just did it with… he reads everything. I just, like, when I'm done with it, when I'm like, hey, you know, I hire him.20900:32:40.190 --> 00:32:54.209The Alliance: for, like, you know, whatever he is, an hour or a project, you know, sometimes it's 5 grand, 10 grand, whatever, it's not usually very big, and I get his feedback. I try to get some friends and whatever, but he will see things like.21000:32:54.540 --> 00:33:00.659The Alliance: you're repeating yourself. You're using this word too much. You're… like, just the bad writing stuff.21100:33:00.900 --> 00:33:06.759The Alliance: and that it's hard to see if a pro can see. He's also really smart, and he knows what21200:33:07.020 --> 00:33:25.530The Alliance: this space, the coaching space, the even performance… we've done stuff on stage, on Peak Performance Aging, together before, or shared an event stage. He knows this world, so he's not coming in blind. He knows professional athletes and is friends with them, has a… actually, I know his Rolodex. His best friend is, like, the…21300:33:25.530 --> 00:33:38.849The Alliance: his best friend is THE guy in baseball. Like, the coach in baseball, basically. The player's coach. I like the guy, but he's, like, he's one of these… anyways, he's very 70s.21400:33:38.910 --> 00:33:47.570The Alliance: It's still going. It's still going. But he's very 70s in his approach, and it's fine. It reminds me… he reminds me a lot of, like, Pete Carroll.21500:33:47.570 --> 00:34:01.239The Alliance: It's that kind of… right, it's that kind of energy. He's great. But anyways, Chip knows the space a little bit. I could do that introduction if you want. He's one dude I pressure tested with. The main thing I do when I pressure test… so I pressure test at 3 levels.21600:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.570The Alliance: I pressure test the stories by telling them to people.21700:34:05.080 --> 00:34:22.899The Alliance: In bars, in clubhouses, on planes. Hey, what are you working on? Oh, I'm doing the… and I just, like, I will use, hey, what are you working on as an excuse to tell you a story to see, do you lean forward? Do your eyes pop? What do you like? When are you listening? You know what I mean? And I'll…21800:34:23.190 --> 00:34:41.539The Alliance: Give it to somebody who's not, say, a peak performance athlete, and then somebody who's, like, an amateur athlete. Like, I just… I just find little… so I test the stories to make sure that what is interesting to me is going to be interesting to a slightly wider fan base, and what are they interested in? Because often the stuff that I'm geeked on as a geek21900:34:41.540 --> 00:34:48.969The Alliance: is not the stuff they hear. So, like, I just want to know. I may think my stuff is better, but I need to know22000:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.450The Alliance: If you're… what are you missing? That sort of thing.22100:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.170The Alliance: is… so I do that a lot.22200:34:54.219 --> 00:35:07.500The Alliance: I pressure test the writing with a bunch of people, right? And I, I believe… like, to me, you have to have your own number, but I believe that I, you know, my pages are edited hundreds of times each.22300:35:07.500 --> 00:35:19.740The Alliance: You know what I mean? That's to get it so it's… it's that readable. But you… so you've got that, but I pressure test the stories, I pressure test… test the, the text itself,22400:35:19.750 --> 00:35:34.860The Alliance: with, you know, before I go to public readers, because public readers, like, my wife is always going to give me a feminist critique, no matter what I fucking ask for. It doesn't matter, right? Like, I'll get feedback, but I'm also going to get feminism, and it's fine, so I try to, like.22500:35:35.410 --> 00:35:39.590The Alliance: Give it to, like, 5 or 6 people. What do they say in common?22600:35:39.880 --> 00:35:47.279The Alliance: Right? If 5 or 6 people give me the same answer, I'm like, oh, that's a thing. Like, I told you, 18 publishers. You know what I learned?22700:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.950The Alliance: I suck.22800:35:48.950 --> 00:36:11.190The Alliance: in the early book, character development, because I want smart people who can see motivation. I don't want to have to tell you. I want you to be able to see my character's motivation and their actions, not tell you. And it… people are too dumb. That worked in the 90s. It doesn't work with today's audience. You can't do that anymore. You have to spell everything out, because people are not used to thinking while reading. They're too used to, like.22900:36:11.390 --> 00:36:25.860The Alliance: social media, which tells… you know, there's no subtlety in social media. It's right there. Oh, yeah. So, like, it's changed readers, and as a result, I have to change with it, and this is what's necessary. But I didn't know, and so, you know, they all had different comments.23000:36:25.860 --> 00:36:44.360The Alliance: But the one thing that was the through line was I couldn't connect with the characters. It was in every… everything I read. The book was confusing, and I couldn't connect with the characters. Okay. And what that actually meant, by the way, just so you know, because that's what 18 publishers told me, what that actually means is23100:36:44.530 --> 00:37:03.639The Alliance: dude, the first 50 pages of your book were broken. If you simplify the plot so I can follow it a little bit more, and let me identify… it wasn't, like, a giant fix. It's a fix on 40 pages out of a 1,000-page book. That's… but, like, they… that was what that meant. So you always have to, like… I always say people…23200:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.600The Alliance: Know when something is wrong, they never know what is wrong.23300:37:08.360 --> 00:37:21.640The Alliance: So if you're asking somebody to read a book, and they're like, this passage is X, Y, or Z, they're probably wrong about X, Y, and Z. Unless they really know what they're talking about, they're probably wrong. But they're right that something kicked them out of the book right then and there.23400:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.540Rick Sessinghaus: Oh, right.23500:37:22.540 --> 00:37:38.570The Alliance: or they got lost, or they got confused, and they're not with you anymore. That's what they know, they got kicked out. They don't often know why, so I trust their reaction, I don't trust their reasoning. I consider their reasoning, but I weigh it against the other things that I've been pressure testing. Does that help?23600:37:39.210 --> 00:37:51.130Rick Sessinghaus: 100%, and I think, you know, my goal is using this book to transition from just being this golf expert into more peak performance and telling a story through,23700:37:51.560 --> 00:38:09.260Rick Sessinghaus: through golf, and then that's, you know, I have my vision of where the next project is gonna then take me, and not jump. Because I wanted, earlier in my career, I made the mistake of trying to jump from, I'm a golf to, oh yeah, I'm a performance expert. It's like, people are like.23800:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.940Rick Sessinghaus: No, you're really good at golf, but where's the through line on that?23900:38:12.940 --> 00:38:20.029The Alliance: Yeah, so I always… I always, I always tell people, you colonize territory with books or…24000:38:20.530 --> 00:38:29.039The Alliance: That's how you… you have… you… books, movies, whatever, you have to… if you want… you're… you're here in the world… so this was…24100:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.340The Alliance: I went from Wes to Jesus.24200:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.229The Alliance: to Rise of Superman, with 3 books in between.24300:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.170Rick Sessinghaus: Oh, got it.24400:38:37.170 --> 00:38:44.519The Alliance: slowly, right? And, and it was, you know what I mean? And, like, so, like, you, you24500:38:44.520 --> 00:38:57.360The Alliance: You always have to colonize terr… nobody wants to give up territory, especially the people. You have to literally, like, if you want to be a performance guy, you have to storm the fucking castle, because there's a bunch of us.24600:38:57.360 --> 00:38:57.760Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, totally.24700:38:57.760 --> 00:39:07.209The Alliance: It's our fucking castle, right? So, like, you gotta… and this is the thing I always tell people, there's an easy way to storm the castle that everybody misses.24800:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.759The Alliance: If you add to the conversation.24900:39:11.010 --> 00:39:24.509The Alliance: If you literally add to the ideas, like, don't just rename things, don't rebrand things, like, literally advance the… if you advance the conversation in a meaningful way, everybody wants you in the conversation.25000:39:24.670 --> 00:39:32.600The Alliance: Like, you have… because now… now you've said something nobody's said before, and you know what I mean? And you have to be in the conversation. That was what I did.25100:39:32.600 --> 00:39:50.990The Alliance: I was the guy who started standing up, screaming, no, no, fuck the psychologists, we need the neurobiology of flow, that's how we're gonna train this, that's how we're gonna decode it, and that's what I literally built everything on that one thing, that, like, you guys are peak performance experts, great, but you're not doing this, and this is what I'm bringing.25200:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.530The Alliance: I brought the narrow.25300:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.060Rick Sessinghaus: Love it.25400:39:53.430 --> 00:40:03.750Rick Sessinghaus: that… what you just said, that's what made a difference in my golf career, because I was a swing coach first, and I really pushed mental game. And there's other sports psychologists, don't get me wrong.25500:40:03.750 --> 00:40:15.119Rick Sessinghaus: But I made it in such a way where people could understand the mental game in a different way, and that brought something to golf industry, and now, like you said, as I move forward.25600:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.919Rick Sessinghaus: to add… I love that. Add something.25700:40:17.920 --> 00:40:29.759The Alliance: Yeah, you gotta… that's where everybody… everybody fucks up, because marketers just rebrand. They just rename something, right? Yeah. And scientists, psychologists will take something, and they'll…25800:40:29.760 --> 00:40:44.560The Alliance: rename it as a model, and that's how they do it, and it's not… it doesn't work, is the other thing. Like, it literally fails. Nobody gets this. It fails. Unless you happen to be Jim Collins.25900:40:45.250 --> 00:41:03.740The Alliance: coin a phrase, like, big, hairy, audacious goals, you know what I mean? But even then, nobody says that anymore. It lasted 10 years, they're back to higher goals, because that's what the psychology, the literature actually says in the psychology. So, like, he rebranded it, it lasted for, like, 5 years until somebody poked a hole in his book.26000:41:03.740 --> 00:41:14.250The Alliance: And now everybody's like, well, do you know Jim Collins did this? But, like, those companies all failed on year 16, you know what I mean? Neither here nor there. I happen to love Jim Collins. I think he did great work.26100:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.980The Alliance: … But….26200:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.460Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.26300:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.489The Alliance: That's why I always tell people, don't just…26400:41:22.250 --> 00:41:37.000The Alliance: write the book, do a study, do your own experiments, just, like, prove something. Do something where, like, you can't see it. I'll give you a great example, that I'm… of stuff that I'm looking at right now. So, a friend of mine is doing this.26500:41:37.660 --> 00:41:44.249The Alliance: everybody, including myself, is talking about AI and its impact on cognition these days. He…26600:41:45.660 --> 00:41:53.609The Alliance: took it farther by running a bunch of tests. He found, by the way, that people… heavy IA users lose their ability to write a coherent email after a month.26700:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.879The Alliance: Right, isn't that crazy? But he's done, like, 7 of those studies, and suddenly you're like.26800:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.540Rick Sessinghaus: -Oh.26900:42:00.540 --> 00:42:23.199The Alliance: And he just did it with his customer base, you know what I mean? Like, he didn't do any… he just… and so now you can't argue with him, because he's added, like, I didn't know that, and that's a sticky thing. So I'm now gonna say, my friend Matty Qualzini's research shows that, blah blah, and for the rest of the time that I'm standing on stage, I'm gonna quote Maddie and talk about his study.27000:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.509The Alliance: And suddenly, he's got a brand he didn't have a month ago.27100:42:26.700 --> 00:42:38.199The Alliance: Right? He added something useful to the conversation that's so sticky that people like me can't help but use it, because it's so much an effective data point, and now you're in the conversation.27200:42:38.490 --> 00:42:39.070Rick Sessinghaus: Awesome.27300:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.039The Alliance: And all you did was run a fucking month-long study on your customer base. Like….27400:42:44.420 --> 00:42:58.990Rick Sessinghaus: That's awesome. Yeah, we're trying to do that. Like, I'm even working with this company called Pyson that's a wearable that does some cognitive stuff, where you do reaction time and stuff like that, and … but the idea is tell a story through it and prove that it flippin' works, and then….27500:42:58.990 --> 00:43:03.279The Alliance: The other thing I would also say is this is… so…27600:43:04.280 --> 00:43:18.720The Alliance: you don't have the pro… you've got famous golfers in your book, so you have names, right? You have to… when you think about books, it's not just what stories I'm telling, it's, am I telling stories about people that are so big27700:43:18.720 --> 00:43:37.890The Alliance: Right, and if you're trying to break into peak performance, it's not just golf stories. You have to talk, right, you have to… you know, I helped Serena Williams, and then I helped the CEO, so, like, you gotta make… people are stupid, and they want to keep you in a category, because we're… our brains do that, right? So you have to…27800:43:37.890 --> 00:43:46.610The Alliance: You gotta literally, like, step by step, leave them out of the category, show why you belong in the new category, you know what I mean? Exactly.27900:43:47.350 --> 00:43:58.670The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, and remember, I colonized action sports first, golf for you, right? And it was only afterwards that I stepped into28000:43:58.920 --> 00:44:04.479The Alliance: the larger peak performance. Oh, man, it was only after I had amassed28100:44:04.670 --> 00:44:08.969The Alliance: enough data on executive everybody else that I could speak to it.28200:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.070The Alliance: And you had to take me seriously, because it was…28300:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.000The Alliance: hard to argue with, you know, my track record at this point, right? It's just like….28400:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.369Rick Sessinghaus: And I'm sure people still do what are… I had one of my first trolls the other day on Instagram, so, who fell.28500:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.870The Alliance: Haters can hate.28600:44:25.870 --> 00:44:26.230Rick Sessinghaus: What's about….28700:44:26.230 --> 00:44:37.869The Alliance: By the way, my staff gets really excited when my marketing guys, all my team, when people hate on me, they're excited. They're like, that's a good sign, it means you're getting, you know, and I'm like.28800:44:37.870 --> 00:44:38.240Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.28900:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.410The Alliance: Buying whatever. Haters gonna hate.29000:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.050Rick Sessinghaus: It is, it is. Thank you.29100:44:43.290 --> 00:44:43.750The Alliance: Yeah.29200:44:44.110 --> 00:44:50.010The Alliance: Yeah, good luck with it, and boom. Do you want an intro to Chip?29300:44:51.220 --> 00:44:59.119Rick Sessinghaus: Yes, I don't think it would hurt. My book coach is also kind of my ghostwriter on it, and he…29400:44:59.970 --> 00:45:08.030Rick Sessinghaus: I really like what he's doing, but again, that's my own biases, because he's helping me tell better stories and those type of things.29500:45:08.760 --> 00:45:14.159The Alliance: I would wait, I mean, what I would do is wait till you're done, and then, like, I don't, like, don't, don't…29600:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.660The Alliance: dueling Ghost Riders is gonna help nobody, right?29700:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.119Rick Sessinghaus: Right, right, yeah, yeah.29800:45:19.120 --> 00:45:29.899The Alliance: get it, get it done, and then get it done that way. Pressure test the stories in the way, get a lot of outside readers, and … but get pro writers to look at it.29900:45:30.360 --> 00:45:38.609The Alliance: Just don't… don't trust that you nailed it, and don't ask anybody to read anything you're writing30000:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.679The Alliance: If you're trying to make a deadline. You know what I mean?30100:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.010Rick Sessinghaus: Oh.30200:45:42.010 --> 00:45:50.020The Alliance: Because all they do is, they're gonna make more work for you. Every time you ask somebody, they're going to make more work for you, and know this.30300:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.870The Alliance: This is the other one.30400:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.310The Alliance: People are not fast readers, so if you say, hey, can you read this for me?30500:45:56.680 --> 00:46:13.060The Alliance: you could get their answer a month later. Of course. Two months later, right? So you have to know that's coming. If you need a lot of fast feedback, you either gotta pay somebody, find really fast readers who are willing to do you a fa… you know what I mean? You gotta incentivize people to get what you want.30600:46:13.210 --> 00:46:21.749The Alliance: Otherwise, like, guys, this is… my favorite is my chief science officer, who's a very slow reader, so, like, literally, I can send him a book.30700:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.970The Alliance: Or something to read, and, like, a month later, he's 10 pages, and I'm like, no, Michael, this isn't, like, I just…30800:46:28.130 --> 00:46:37.219The Alliance: This doesn't help them. This, you're not fucking helpful. You're actually wasting my time. Are you gonna finish it, or do I have to hire a different neuroscientist? It's entirely up to you.30900:46:37.810 --> 00:46:38.340Rick Sessinghaus: That's funny.31000:46:38.340 --> 00:46:43.650The Alliance: Oh, one last thing I want to say before I gotta jump is this was useful to me.31100:46:43.830 --> 00:46:51.290The Alliance: When setting boundaries, it's an if-then statement. It's not a…31200:46:51.360 --> 00:47:07.910The Alliance: hey, I want you to do this. It's, hey, I want you to do this. If you don't do this on time, I'm gonna be forced to X. It's a… you're not asking them, you're telling them if they do X, they will produce this behavior that they don't want.31300:47:07.910 --> 00:47:20.240The Alliance: Right? And that was really helpful to me, because I would always be like, oh, you know, I'd like it on Friday, you know, but I can have it on Monday, I'm cool, you know, if you're slammed.31400:47:20.270 --> 00:47:26.339The Alliance: Rather than being like, if you don't get into me on Friday, I'll be forced to hire somebody else and I'll take it out of your paycheck.31500:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.660Rick Sessinghaus: Got it. Right.31600:47:29.660 --> 00:47:36.149The Alliance: I mean, like, literally, I've had to… I just went to my entire staff and went.31700:47:36.540 --> 00:47:44.980The Alliance: Anybody who sells a feature for a class, because they think it's a good idea, without… if it's not on our feature set.31800:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.100Rick Sessinghaus: Oh….31900:47:46.550 --> 00:47:53.809The Alliance: So, Chase, I'll give you a simple example. Chase was selling the Alliance, and I planned on doing two pop-ups.32000:47:53.960 --> 00:47:59.879The Alliance: And he told everybody it was gonna be a pop-up a month. And that extra pop-up a month.32100:48:00.450 --> 00:48:02.089The Alliance: Ended up costing…32200:48:02.450 --> 00:48:15.250The Alliance: $20,000 by the time it was said… said, you know what I mean? And so suddenly, like, 3 or 4 of those things happened, function creep, and suddenly I was like, oh guys, you're now, like, we're… you're at the… you've… you've…32300:48:15.340 --> 00:48:29.080The Alliance: edged towards profit margin that we need. Like, if you guys do this again, the next person who does this, it's coming out of your commission. I'm no longer covering your shit. We did it once.32400:48:29.090 --> 00:48:36.799The Alliance: Cool, we know what works, we know what doesn't, we know what the customers can handle, what they can't handle. This first one was experiment, I'm good with it.32500:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.040The Alliance: It is never gonna happen again, or it's coming out of your pocket.32600:48:41.170 --> 00:48:41.740Rick Sessinghaus: Fair.32700:48:42.190 --> 00:48:57.809The Alliance: Right. Like, you just… like, I hate doing shit like that. Fucking makes me feel terrible, but if you don't, people are just gonna walk over… over you, because they can't. Not… they're not trying to be assholes, they're just, you know…32800:48:57.950 --> 00:49:05.579The Alliance: We do it too, right? If I have any autonomy, most of the time, I may… you know what I mean, I may take it.32900:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.480Rick Sessinghaus: Bum.33000:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.810Rick Sessinghaus: Good.33100:49:08.470 --> 00:49:14.410The Alliance: That's my thinking. But I, I… last question for you, one quick question for you.33200:49:14.630 --> 00:49:22.400The Alliance: I'm, … I've been loving… I mean, like, you haven't been in enough stuff, and I'm mad at you for that, and you better be in New York.33300:49:22.570 --> 00:49:23.510Rick Sessinghaus: I am, I am.33400:49:23.510 --> 00:49:38.349The Alliance: Alright, but … people want to meet you, but no, I'm not really actually mad at you, I don't… I don't really care. But it seems like you've gotten a ton out of this, despite your hectic schedule. Like, just judging from the… it seems like this has actually worked for you in a good.33500:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.439Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, yes, you know, if I look back.33600:49:42.540 --> 00:50:00.990Rick Sessinghaus: I think… and this is something that happens all the time, I think I can do all this stuff, and then the reality hits, and I can't. And there was stuff that, when I first signed up, I… and I was even talking to Chase a little bit about, I go, do you guys have the calendar? Do you guys actually have the dates? He goes, not yet. I go.33700:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.280The Alliance: This is one thing, yeah.33800:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.959Rick Sessinghaus: I was rolling the dice, because.33900:50:04.960 --> 00:50:17.280The Alliance: So, this was one of the lessons, is I thought it would be fun for people to do these little pop-ups, and blah blah blah, and I started to realize, one,34000:50:19.610 --> 00:50:31.989The Alliance: it didn't… it wasn't working for anybody. Like, people are like… and I… by the way, I'm the same way. Like, I don't want to pop up like that. I was like, what am I doing? I want to be able to calendar months in advance. So…34100:50:31.990 --> 00:50:40.900The Alliance: we're never, like, that's no longer… the next… the next alliance, I, like, I don't even know if I'm gonna do… I may just do an event in the middle.34200:50:40.900 --> 00:50:51.239The Alliance: For everybody? Like, just a… just a meetup, this one, so everybody can get on the calendar, rather than… because it… it was… it was a mistake, we thought it was going to be a great idea.34300:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.120The Alliance: It… it was a fail. Okay, I knew there was gonna be fails.34400:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.480Rick Sessinghaus: That's why, by the way, you guys are $36,000 and the next class is $50,000.34500:51:00.800 --> 00:51:09.669Rick Sessinghaus: There you go, there you go. No, I… yeah, I get a lot out of it. I… I have failed as far as applying the tools as much as I would like.34600:51:09.670 --> 00:51:31.449Rick Sessinghaus: Okay? Having the masterminds, having, you know, people to talk to and stuff like that, I've had a couple relationships that have built, this is fantastic. It's on me, though, Steven, is that I try to… if you now did it in fall, when I don't have the PGA Tour, and when I don't have… it would have been a different game, but I don't want to make excuses, but I was so excited to be a part of it that I said yes, so….34700:51:31.620 --> 00:51:39.459The Alliance: Well, I appreciate you. We're going to, it's gonna fold into, and I don't know exactly what it looks like, but we're going to, …34800:51:40.000 --> 00:51:51.339The Alliance: I'm gonna do a year-long, I'm gonna keep it ongoing. It'll be… it's gonna be much… it's gonna be… it's gonna be a… literally, we're gonna do two live events, one, like, 3-day trip.34900:51:51.390 --> 00:52:07.790The Alliance: over the summer, that'll be fun, and one, I'm gonna do the normal alliance, and on our la- I'm gonna tack on a day, and bring everybody together so everybody can meet, and everything else is, like, it's like four group… 4 individual coaching calls with me a year, because I've discovered that's about…35000:52:07.840 --> 00:52:13.729The Alliance: every… anything that people want. They don't, like, you don't need me every month. It's not like…35100:52:13.840 --> 00:52:27.370The Alliance: I'm a sports coach who's correcting your swing in real time, or a writing coach. You actually need time to go take it, roll the shit out, pressure test it, see how it fails, come, right? Exactly. And then we'll do… and we'll do a monthly, like.35200:52:27.450 --> 00:52:42.770The Alliance: Q&A call, book club, people have been… everyone's been wanting a book club, so I'll start doing some book clubs, like, that's what we're gonna do, because I was like, this is what I learned. I was like, okay, I now know really what my… because remember in the beginning of the thing, I said to you.35300:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.889The Alliance: I said to everybody, I said, the thing I'm gonna fuck up on35400:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.580The Alliance: Is how much of your time to take.35500:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.660The Alliance: We loaded this up.35600:52:50.700 --> 00:52:57.240The Alliance: We loaded this, because I didn't want Amy to walk out the other end going, oh, the curriculum didn't deliver.35700:52:57.240 --> 00:53:11.669The Alliance: we loaded it up intentionally. We gave people more than we thought they needed, and now we can scale it back to exactly, I think, what's gonna work the best for people. But live and learn. Same thing about your curriculum. Like, you gotta know what's coming, right?35800:53:11.670 --> 00:53:12.130Rick Sessinghaus: Exactly.35900:53:12.130 --> 00:53:12.780The Alliance: Mom.36000:53:12.780 --> 00:53:13.530Rick Sessinghaus: Exactly.36100:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.999The Alliance: I am excited to see you in New York. Wow, is the space cool.36200:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.539Rick Sessinghaus: Oh my god, I didn't know it was gonna….36300:53:21.540 --> 00:53:31.439The Alliance: the guy's building it, right? Like, it could have gone any which way, and I… and I were rolling the ice, because the space was so cool, and then I saw the final build, and I was like, oh my god.36400:53:31.740 --> 00:53:46.840The Alliance: oh my god, you built a… wow! It, like, I literally, I was like, I don't… I mean, I have only seen pictures, but I was like, this is swank, and it doesn't look like anything I've ever seen before. It, like, it's got… it's weird, it's the first time I've seen it. It's got, like.36500:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.750The Alliance: like a classic Vegas Caesars vibe.36600:53:51.950 --> 00:54:14.069The Alliance: redone through, like, a very modern… you're gonna walk in, you'll see what I was saying. You're gonna walk in here, you'll be like, I don't know what this is. This has got, like, the classic appeal of, like, old-school casinos that haven't existed for 50 years in a new… like, I was… and by the way, it's a weed store, yoga studio, and nightclub, right? Like, that's what it is. Like, it's not…36700:54:14.070 --> 00:54:25.279The Alliance: a casino, there's none of those things. It's like a weed store on top, there's a nightclub art space in the middle, and a yoga studio on the bottom. And I was like, wow, okay, this is what the future looks like. Okay, cool.36800:54:25.500 --> 00:54:25.930Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.36900:54:25.930 --> 00:54:27.610The Alliance: It's on top of a subway station.37000:54:27.900 --> 00:54:34.960Rick Sessinghaus: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah, I was telling my daughter, who went to NYU, where I was going to be. Oh, yeah, I had to walk there all the time, I'm a pastor, so it'll be cool.37100:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.100Rick Sessinghaus: So….37200:54:36.100 --> 00:54:42.249The Alliance: It'll be fun. Alright, I'm glad we're gonna see you, that'll be excellent. Thank you. And you'll like… by the way, you'll get to play with our AI.37300:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.129The Alliance: Right, you'll get to see what our… what our Flow AI looks like.37400:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.379Rick Sessinghaus: Love it, love it.37500:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.690The Alliance: Alright, be good. I'll see you in a month.37600:54:49.690 --> 00:54:50.620Rick Sessinghaus: There you go,
