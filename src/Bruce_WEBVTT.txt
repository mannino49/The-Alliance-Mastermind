WEBVTT100:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.910Bruce Bowser: Steven.200:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.130The Alliance: How are you?300:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.950Bruce Bowser: I am whack, job.400:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.760The Alliance: I loved your slideshow of your life.500:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.560Bruce Bowser: Oh!600:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.029The Alliance: That was so excellent. Both Ryan and I were just like, Wow, that's so cool. Yeah, both of us were talking about it yesterday.700:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.701Bruce Bowser: Thank you, I mean, look, it's it. That's the stretch for me, right? Some. I'm so corporate in so many ways that800:02:08.350 --> 00:02:24.050The Alliance: Well, we that's what we were talking about. We were talking about how it was actually a perfect balance skills, sweet spot extension of where you are like it was, it was just perfectly done for exactly where you are. It was really like, you know, you don't need my help. You got that.900:02:24.050 --> 00:02:38.457Bruce Bowser: No, no, I I definitely need your help. But it's funny. I I I shared it with one of my Ypo for mates, who's a really good buddy? We we went. I left your event. By the way, which is great, so like I mean, honestly like it was1000:02:39.427 --> 00:02:40.402Bruce Bowser: It was1100:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.310The Alliance: Thank you.1200:02:41.310 --> 00:02:52.120Bruce Bowser: I didn't know what to expect, but I was over. You overachieved in that one. So thank you, and your group is great, and the skiing day was like incredible. Met some great people, but I left there.1300:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.759The Alliance: You nailed it. By the way, it's the conditions did not hold up. I was back there this weekend. I gotta go one more day this weekend, and they're like we got the last good day. I think.1400:03:01.760 --> 00:03:15.338Bruce Bowser: Oh, yeah, no, it was like heavenly for me. So thank you for that. But I so I left. There flew back. It's a long freaking hike to Toronto, spent one night in Toronto, and then left the next day for London, England, and attended a 8 day1500:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.060Bruce Bowser: business exec program at the the London Business School.1600:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.169Bruce Bowser: which is put on by by Ypo, and it was like 8 Am. To 10 pm. Almost every night. It was like1700:03:27.280 --> 00:03:38.350Bruce Bowser: way, too much information, but good, like, really good information. So I'm just kinda I just got back here to Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2 days ago. So I'm1800:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.460Bruce Bowser: just adjusting.1900:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.990The Alliance: Got it.2000:03:40.257 --> 00:03:41.059Bruce Bowser: It's pretty good.2100:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.740Bruce Bowser: Got it.2200:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.960Bruce Bowser: But it's just. It's amazing how many you know how interconnected.2300:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.789Bruce Bowser: you know life is. And I've you know I've always believed that, like, you know, I go to2400:03:54.606 --> 00:03:59.849Bruce Bowser: go to this conference, and in the, you know, in the2500:04:00.150 --> 00:04:12.515Bruce Bowser: process of like a business conference that's largely aimed around. You know what's going on economically in the world and business wise. But a lot of AI which is really cool like what's happening in AI. But this one professor that2600:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.710Bruce Bowser: I got to talk to his dean of business over there.2700:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.949Bruce Bowser: We gotta talk about gratitude currently.2800:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.955Bruce Bowser: and all the years like2900:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.487Bruce Bowser: I don't know if you ever met my friend3000:04:26.440 --> 00:04:37.664Bruce Bowser: Ian Ian Lopetin. Ian Loperton's a he's like I'm like a corporate. Whack job. You're like an artistic whack job. He's like3100:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.539Bruce Bowser: Hope you don't mind being called a whack job. He started.3200:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.139The Alliance: It's a high compliment, I think.3300:04:43.353 --> 00:04:43.779Bruce Bowser: He is.3400:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.120The Alliance: Right.3500:04:44.210 --> 00:04:53.086Bruce Bowser: Something called spiritual gangster been remarkably successful. He was a la lawyer before that we met at a conference that3600:04:54.284 --> 00:04:55.859Bruce Bowser: in Zurich, like.3700:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.770The Alliance: Oh, I had an entire bit I used to do based on that T-shirt.3800:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.160Bruce Bowser: Oh, there you go! So I mean.3900:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.099The Alliance: Spiritual gang. Come on, bitch, give me your fucking, Karma.4000:05:04.100 --> 00:05:18.879Bruce Bowser: Exactly so you should. You should meet him. Someday. He's just a great great guy, anyway. So we started doing this gratitude journal like 14 or 15 years ago, and it was a 5 min journal, I mean, if you ever seen that like, it's a you know, and I have the app.4100:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.369Bruce Bowser: And so you know, every day. I you know I I make it a point almost every day4200:05:24.863 --> 00:05:31.910Bruce Bowser: to do gratitude, journaling, and one of the things I learned talking to this professor, which was a A cool little hack was4300:05:32.180 --> 00:05:41.820Bruce Bowser: because it can be challenging some days to, you know, to write something meaningful, and you're probably already doing this so preaching to the choir. But for me it was insightful. It was like4400:05:42.040 --> 00:05:53.670Bruce Bowser: never thought of what for. So he said, Bruce, when you do your gratitude journal, like the thing that you're you know. What are the 3 things that you're grateful for? Go a step farther, and and answer the question, Why are you grateful for them?4500:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.079Bruce Bowser: And it was like4600:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.569Bruce Bowser: shit. So you know, I would put in. I was grateful to have dinner with my 3 granddaughters last week.4700:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.419Bruce Bowser: That would be like the next morning, like you have dinner with them last night. It was like super grateful for that.4800:06:08.960 --> 00:06:21.690Bruce Bowser: And the why? Part is because, I get to be a part of their lives. Have a little bit of impact, and you know how they're going to grow, and it brings back incredibly fond memories of4900:06:27.730 --> 00:06:38.419Bruce Bowser: being a dad like I'm I'm so close to my daughters, but it's like, you know. So all of a sudden I'm writing a gratitude journal that's taken on a whole new dimension. So it's like5000:06:38.817 --> 00:06:44.252Bruce Bowser: it. There's super cool like just how that brought it. But like I would say, you know, when I came back from5100:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.206The Alliance: Yeah, let me ask. Let me ask you. Let me cause a kick off. Let me ask you my kickoff question, because I think you're circling it and5200:06:50.810 --> 00:07:02.706The Alliance: frame it for. No, no, let me just frame it for you, because we have a little bit of time, and I want to maximize it for you. But this is what your point I wanted to know, and this is even better, because you were. You got the second coaching5300:07:03.080 --> 00:07:13.549The Alliance: So it cluttered things up even more so, you know, you know my approach is that fire hose approach. Give them all. Give them all the information, and5400:07:14.250 --> 00:07:27.249The Alliance: you know. Usually I want to see what sticks couple of weeks later. Right? This is why it's it's done this way at is usually you learn on about the person, and maybe where the5500:07:27.520 --> 00:07:43.549The Alliance: great starting point is for them. So what sort of blew your mind? What stuck with you that we we covered what was immediately actionable, that is, has turned into something for you, or feels like it should be immediately actionable that that maybe we can shape into something for you.5600:07:43.550 --> 00:07:57.049Bruce Bowser: Sure. So I think it's you know the thing that the the you know the big takeaway for me was this cycle of creativity and innovation. Right? So you know, looking at it as5700:07:57.860 --> 00:08:04.529Bruce Bowser: more of a exercise than you know philosophical. So you you broke it down that you know5800:08:04.840 --> 00:08:27.639Bruce Bowser: you have a preparation component tool, which is, you know, identifying what is the problem or the opportunity that you're. You know that you're trying to to solve. We'll say it and then letting that incubate while you do other things right. And you know, as you were telling me that as we were talking through that I was thinking like, well, that's been like my experience, and some of the you know. The best insights I've had is when I've5900:08:27.710 --> 00:08:38.190Bruce Bowser: you know, instead of sitting down trying to solve the problem, I you know it just comes to me after the fact, right like when I'm doing something else. And so the the incubation6000:08:39.030 --> 00:08:49.239Bruce Bowser: process. And then when that little light goes on, illumination is like, that's it. That's what I need to do right, and and I had some of those Aha! Moment. Aha! Moments in6100:08:49.930 --> 00:08:56.060Bruce Bowser: in London, England, I'm convinced, as a result of6200:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.550Bruce Bowser: of you know that highlight that takeaway from yours, your session.6300:09:04.050 --> 00:09:11.089The Alliance: How does that does that mean? You start building more release activities into your day to day, focus a little bit on that.6400:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.639Bruce Bowser: Yeah, it was for what? What it means for me right now is, I'm taking a problem.6500:09:16.850 --> 00:09:22.441Bruce Bowser: and I'm putting it into that sphere of okay,6600:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.600Bruce Bowser: it let it incubate a little bit right? Like you've identified the problem. I'll give you a quick example. I'm opening these vet clinics right?6700:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.330Bruce Bowser: The the vets push me around a little too much right?6800:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.739Bruce Bowser: And I'm like it's getting in the way of of building the business we want to build.6900:09:41.310 --> 00:09:55.949Bruce Bowser: And then I say to myself, well, I created the problem. And the problem is, I've made it too easy for the vets, right? Because when I start the vets. It's a high burnout. I wanted to make sure they had work life balance. They don't make a ton of money. I wanted to make sure, I solved all the financial problems for them7000:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.010Bruce Bowser: and7100:09:57.623 --> 00:10:09.230Bruce Bowser: in creating that problem or not created in, you know, in doing that, I created this problem. The problem is, I kind of get pushed around. They don't listen to me. Like like I feel like I should be listened to some days.7200:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.880Bruce Bowser: and then the Aha was so I parked that. And I just like, that's my problem. I gotta solve that problem.7300:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.390Bruce Bowser: The Aha moment was Bruce.7400:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.110Bruce Bowser: You made it too easy for them. You took7500:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.240Bruce Bowser: any risk out of the equation for them.7600:10:24.450 --> 00:10:30.639Bruce Bowser: And that's what's created this. You know, this problem slash, you know.7700:10:31.000 --> 00:10:52.540Bruce Bowser: minor problem where you know I feel awkward talking to them about the business side of it. So you know that. You know, then illuminates right like it. So it's it's incubating. Sorry. And then the illumination was, you know, that I've made it too too easy for them, and so I've scheduled a meeting, for you know, the Saturday morning with the group of vets to talk about. Hey, guys?7800:10:53.715 --> 00:11:01.609Bruce Bowser: my bad. But here's what's happened, and we need to start taking our business reviews more seriously right? Because7900:11:01.840 --> 00:11:20.159Bruce Bowser: cause I think we should be opening on weekends. And they now we don't want to work weekends. I'm like, well, we can get other people work weekends because there are a lot of people that have pets that can't get time off during the day. We're only open during the day at this one particular clinic. So to me, the following, that cycle helped me.8000:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.909The Alliance: Oh, no, I like I I what I'm so8100:11:23.300 --> 00:11:42.937The Alliance: do you remember we talked about the Macgyver method and release activities. Those are all the research shows that there's certain activities that incubate better than others low grade physical activity. Right? So you may not want to go play hockey, but you may want to go skate. You know what I mean, like that kind of thing, and8200:11:43.580 --> 00:11:52.909The Alliance: You could like. I give you an example every day when I'm done writing. I go immediately. I meet like desk into the mountains, hiking my dog8300:11:52.910 --> 00:12:16.890The Alliance: right? And the reason is it's the incubation period, right? For the 1st 20 min, my brain still in the office and going 100 miles an hour. But sooner or later, you know the physical exertion. Just sort of kicks in and gets quiet. And then, usually 10 min later. By the time I'm back at my desk, 3 or 4 of those problems are actually solved for me. So I built in the release phase. Do you have that stuff in your in your day already8400:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.250The Alliance: locked in? You've been doing this for a while.8500:12:20.580 --> 00:12:27.319Bruce Bowser: Yeah, I mean, no, but I I've taken too much. But for granted. So you know that all resonates.8600:12:27.695 --> 00:12:33.309Bruce Bowser: You know, not to sound like smart ass. But I wrote a book about you know how you incorporate. You know8700:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.410Bruce Bowser: time into your day for these things, and I just got away from it. So you know the a big takeaway8800:12:42.810 --> 00:12:51.470Bruce Bowser: that you know that is high on my list here is to build that that time into my schedule, and I have it like I'm like, I'm you know.8900:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.110Bruce Bowser: I'm I'm quite capable of9000:12:55.618 --> 00:13:08.999Bruce Bowser: leaving after this session, which I probably will do, and I live in a beautiful boulevard that ends at a incredible park, and I used to go for walks there. I've missed out on the walks. I'll go for a walk.9100:13:09.000 --> 00:13:26.270The Alliance: So I like, well, that's I'm looking for 3 or 4 things to give to Ryan to hold you accountable to basically like. So I'm holding you accountable to, you know. Walks in the Park, I don't, you know. 3 to at least 3 to 5 a week9200:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.999The Alliance: for release activities.9300:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.639Bruce Bowser: Yeah, I look, I exercise 3 to 5 times a week, so I don't need to. We don't need to put.9400:13:33.640 --> 00:13:42.299The Alliance: Yeah, you don't. It doesn't look like you needed more exercise or anything like I was looking at your stuff. I was like, you've really got it. You got a lot of it dialed you clearly.9500:13:43.570 --> 00:13:49.160Bruce Bowser: It's what I always it's well, it's I mean, it's what I've always seen at the top, right? The higher up you get.9600:13:49.280 --> 00:14:05.519The Alliance: The more people have to be dialed. You can't function at this level. It's too hard. There's too much shit going on. If you don't have it all dialed. I think that's really true. So tell me what else is going on. And tell me, did you bring me challenges to help you solve.9700:14:06.253 --> 00:14:08.556Bruce Bowser: Yeah, I've been also for me.9800:14:09.120 --> 00:14:22.756Bruce Bowser: it's just basically it's in busy time. So now I'm you know, I'm starting to do some reading again, just because I you know, I was immersed in this this London business school. But so for me, I made some notes like challenges. Are9900:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.060Bruce Bowser: are going to be10000:14:25.120 --> 00:14:37.449Bruce Bowser: using the or activating the creative side of my brain right? So like, I don't know if it was you that said it, but it could have been somebody over in London that said it when they're talking about education or something like, you know, as kids.10100:14:37.500 --> 00:14:57.200Bruce Bowser: we were taught. Hey, brochure! You're more of a hockey player. You're not really an artist like drop out of art class and go play hockey, so I've never used it even like I love music like I mean, I don't listen to music much, but I play the guitar like I'm completely self taught because I can't read a fucking note of music. Right? I wish I'd learned music.10200:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.050The Alliance: That's great!10300:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.230Bruce Bowser: Be, you know, more meaningful.10400:15:02.290 --> 00:15:11.410Bruce Bowser: so I need to, you know, play my guitar more. So. There's a, you know. But I want to get into this drawing thing. But I need to play my guitar more. So you're gonna put other things on the list of.10500:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.069The Alliance: Yeah, I like creative biker dosing is, yeah, I mean, so here's the thing I would say, Bruce, on this one10600:15:18.310 --> 00:15:24.520The Alliance: like, ultimately, when I think about10700:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.120The Alliance: creativity, and I think about my own life.10800:15:28.130 --> 00:15:49.750The Alliance: I assume one that I mean, I know that my production with creativity kind of unlocks new stuff right? And the point is just to sort of do it. Try to do it every day for really just brief periods of times. You just get that in there, even if you know what I mean. 10 min planning time to come back for a walk and back into your day. Kind of thing could be that just to10900:15:51.260 --> 00:16:08.159The Alliance: and then like what the experiment that I would would ask myself is like, you know, if you're playing your guitar every day, and learning to draw every other day, or like playing guitar for the next 2 weeks, and then learning to draw like, does an unfamiliar creative skill, like learning to draw11000:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.180The Alliance: trigger more stuff.11100:16:10.410 --> 00:16:22.430The Alliance: or does spring up like? Those are the questions I would just like simple biohacker questions like, right, is it some combination of new creative activity and old creativity. That's the right balanced view. And ultimately, I think11200:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.369The Alliance: you'll get this really easily. I think of creativity as11300:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.969The Alliance: more of like an attitude towards everything I do. So.11400:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.980The Alliance: you know, I always try to take the time11500:16:37.010 --> 00:16:44.399The Alliance: when I'm sure of something I'm always take the time to be like. Why am I sure of this? What would happen if11600:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.530The Alliance: there was some other thing that was true?11700:16:47.710 --> 00:17:01.629The Alliance: And I, just, you know, give myself a couple of seconds to think about it, right to let other pause. I'm training my brain to let other possibilities start to emerge, and simultaneously, whenever I do anything if I when I'm in.11800:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.310The Alliance: I don't get it right all the time, either. When I'm on my game.11900:17:06.319 --> 00:17:06.719Bruce Bowser: Sure.12000:17:06.720 --> 00:17:21.920The Alliance: Like. I never just cook a meal. I always try to find 6 new ingredients. And how do I cook a meal with these ingredients, just, you know, just because I want to train creativity as a muscle.12100:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.990The Alliance: and12200:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.950The Alliance: you know, and then, like I can, I measure things in 2 places. Right? You'll get. I measure things in my writing.12300:17:30.970 --> 00:18:00.870The Alliance: Well, 3 places in my writing, in my business ideas and in my performance as an athlete, right? Because when I'm creative on the snow, that's the best feeling, and I'm not. That's that's not a guarantee. The day we were together was really hard to get my body to interpret the terrain creatively. It didn't like my body didn't want to move that way at all. Because I was so worn out from the event. So I think I don't think it's an everyday thing. But I think that's how I think about it. Does that make any sense to you?12400:18:01.100 --> 00:18:08.809Bruce Bowser: It makes lots of sense to me. I've made a bunch of notes. I I there's there's some things that that I will definitely.12500:18:09.010 --> 00:18:18.500The Alliance: The reason the Re. Let me give you. Let me give you a target. Just so you know what you're shooting at, also, because this will help at a really micro level. So literally12600:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.949The Alliance: as this skill.12700:18:21.510 --> 00:18:34.950The Alliance: I think. And I can't exactly prove this to you, though Scott Berry Coppin, who we're gonna meet later on, and I have gone. He's done a lot of work on parts. This some of this was done by David Eagleman some way Scott Berry copy. So we put together. But we really think that creativity12800:18:35.200 --> 00:18:49.830The Alliance: is. You know, you've we all heard about beginner mind, and looking at, you know, old things new again. That's actually a neurobiological thing, right? There's a process in the brain that when you look at a thing you know makes meaning. And12900:18:50.100 --> 00:19:08.799The Alliance: how long, until we decide upon what a thing means is our entire ability to freestyle. That's where the creativity is really gonna happen. So in a sense, all you're trying to do is build like a microsecond delay into a habitual pattern.13000:19:08.800 --> 00:19:20.579The Alliance: That's really the outcome we're we're looking for, because in that microsecond delay when you're like. What could another? What could a couple of other options be? Right? The other one that I13100:19:20.790 --> 00:19:39.380The Alliance: think that is, that that's sort of like a divergent. I also always do the conversion. If I have 2 things that I'm interested in, I force myself to be like, well, where do they relate. What's the weird connection here? If I was going to write a magazine article and somebody came to me and said, Steven, you've got to write a magazine article about cowboys and hockey.13200:19:39.820 --> 00:20:06.759The Alliance: Okay, what a cowboy! You know what I mean, like, what is that like, you know, those are 2 interesting, weird ass categories. I'm sort of both interested in cowboys and hockey. Where the fuck did they overlap right like that would always be those. This were always good articles like they were. You know what I mean. They were interesting. If your brain is like ha! Cowboys, hockey, that's interesting, right? And so like it was easy to get readers and interested in whatever. But it was a really great creative thinking exercise as well to just sort of train my brain13300:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.890The Alliance: hunt connections between weird shit and13400:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.670The Alliance: ask for other interpretations. Those.13500:20:13.670 --> 00:20:19.353Bruce Bowser: So how do I look for those, David? Sorry to interrupt me like, how do I look for those like? What's a you know13600:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.669Bruce Bowser: a practical way to look for those connections. Is it like.13700:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.459The Alliance: Oh, so.13800:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.260Bruce Bowser: Or do I make them.13900:20:26.260 --> 00:20:40.320The Alliance: I? Yeah. Well, let me listen. Let me. Let me let me give you 3 answers or 2 answers. The short answer is, if you want to cheat the process these days, and I would tell you to do this second, not first, st14000:20:40.420 --> 00:20:52.299The Alliance: that Gbt is a convergent thinking engine, so check can literally take anything and find you the overlap. It's remarkably good at that, but what I would tell you to 1st do is14100:20:53.059 --> 00:21:09.209The Alliance: let's go back to cowboys and hockey. Right? What I would do is I'd be like, okay. If I was looking for the intersection of cowboys and hockey. I would start by one I'd start by refreshing my memory about cowboys. 10 min, cowboy, brief, 10 min hockey brief. Then I would like start14200:21:09.490 --> 00:21:19.970The Alliance: letting my brain incubate. Then I'd go for an debate like, where where do these things? When, where do any of these things intersect? Right like? And it is it14300:21:21.710 --> 00:21:37.409The Alliance: did cowboy music play a role in hockey, is it that cowboy food is good hockey? You know what I mean? Like, I just start asking those things. And I just I like to let my brain. Really, I really like. So most people have a hard14400:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.529The Alliance: time, this stuff because they don't14500:21:40.370 --> 00:21:54.000The Alliance: practice incubation. They don't believe it's gonna work. But you literally have a fucking pattern recognition system for a brain. It does converge it, thinking automatically as long as you feed it. The information given the time to process it, so I would14600:21:54.130 --> 00:22:09.830The Alliance: do it yourself with an incubation period, and then on the back end of the incubation period. You know what I mean. I'd write your stuff down. I'd feed it all in Chat Gpt, and say, Hey, this is what I I was looking at. The intersection of these things. These are the things I'm seeing. What else are you seeing? And14700:22:09.890 --> 00:22:25.639The Alliance: and then just repeat that process over time, and you'll start to, you know A, you'll start to be able to do it. And B, you'll get start getting really immediate feedback on the back end about blind spots, the possibility of things like that. And you, the problem, what is14800:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.830The Alliance: creativity is so fucking hard to teach14900:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.529The Alliance: because you have to do. Basically, you have to spend a lot of time getting adults to to act like children15000:22:34.720 --> 00:22:45.820The Alliance: in the interest of learning how to think differently. And until the different thinking shows up, you really don't believe like you don't believe it. And then, when it starts to show up, you're like.15100:22:45.980 --> 00:22:59.380The Alliance: Oh, my God! I got a superpower that other people don't have, and you don't. You've actually just taught your brain to do what it's naturally designed to do a little bit better. But it really I always think that like, you know, if you have a little more.15200:23:00.030 --> 00:23:04.840The Alliance: I'm less impressed by intelligence because there's a lot of fucking smart people in the world15300:23:05.810 --> 00:23:34.120The Alliance: much like you if you're looking for an edge. I'm like creativity humor. You know what I mean, like you and I have that also. The ability to talk to anybody. You know what I mean. Like these are these are the edges that actually ultimately matter in the end. Once you're you know what I mean when you're at the end to really try to maximize, I think. All right. So that's 1 that's cool. I like the I like the more guitar and oh, and, by the way, with the creative stuff15400:23:34.510 --> 00:23:50.880The Alliance: for a while, when I wanna you might do something similar. I just literally write it on note cards that I carry with me so like throughout my day. You know what I mean like. I'll have a note card that says, Why am I so sure? Are there other options? And how do these things relate?15500:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.649The Alliance: Right? And you just every now and again you pull up the note card and you look. And you're like, okay, I gotta sort of make the decision.15600:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.090Bruce Bowser: So what's the 3 questions? Are there other options.15700:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.579The Alliance: Yeah, like, why am I sure of this?15800:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.780The Alliance: Are there any other interesting possibilities?15900:24:04.890 --> 00:24:29.905The Alliance: And then the other question is, when you're looking for you know. And how do these things relate? Right is between the divergent one. I just asked myself to. Just so I remind myself to ask my just stop not. It's really easy to be sure of things, and I'd rather not be sure you know what I mean. I like. I don't want to be sure of things until I'm totally sure of things, and16000:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.320Bruce Bowser: I love that bye, bye.16100:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.975The Alliance: I?16200:24:36.120 --> 00:24:46.039The Alliance: yes, and at some point we're going to start talking about how to get slow for vets is interesting, really sort of sort of thinking about it, just saying,16300:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.279The Alliance: are you and Stephanie going into business? By the way.16400:24:49.758 --> 00:24:55.019Bruce Bowser: I don't know. We're going to business, I mean, Stephanie. Is, so you know.16500:24:55.220 --> 00:25:11.460Bruce Bowser: incredibly great to meet her. We we've had. We've we're actually gonna do a zoom call to talk about the vet business, and next week or the week after you know, I just love where she's at in terms of you know, being a vet, but wanting to incorporate.16600:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.310The Alliance: Super entrepreneurial. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw.16700:25:13.310 --> 00:25:33.329Bruce Bowser: Into the lives of vets. So who knows? I mean, if I'd love to buy her practice. And and you know, because that's 1 of our that I mean, I know that I never buy a practice. We open new practice. But one of our, you know, we're geographically expanding across Canada. So16800:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.549The Alliance: So fill, fill a gap too.16900:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.450Bruce Bowser: Yeah, that's a that's a big gap. And Manitoba, nobody in the freaking world wants to go there. It's the worst place to.17000:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.169The Alliance: Right exactly, exactly, and to have 2 pets. You have clinics there. That would be dope right.17100:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.554Bruce Bowser: Yeah, no, it's that's that's helpful. I use like, I'm big on reminders. So17200:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.830Bruce Bowser: you know, I.17300:25:52.830 --> 00:26:11.330The Alliance: Yeah. So so we so Chick sent me high invented this research method. You've probably heard of it known as the Experience sampling method. I don't know. It's really so. What it is really funny it was they were trying to figure out, how do you study flow in the wild right? And they had these really decent diagnostics. But17400:26:12.180 --> 00:26:21.669The Alliance: they were. They didn't want to just like put people through the experience and have like that wasn't a good picture of daily living and whatever. So the pay pagers showed up.17500:26:21.820 --> 00:26:29.427The Alliance: So they literally would page people randomly over an 8 day period. And it's when they got the page they would.17600:26:30.551 --> 00:26:51.969The Alliance: take the quiz. Basically. So one of the things that I'll sometimes do is throughout the day. I'll set an alarm for like an hour and 10 min from now, right? And when it goes off I have to look at my questions and reset the alarm, for, like the next, you know, whatever some random time, and I never know it's about that. You know what I mean. I'm never paying attention to my clock.17700:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.159Bruce Bowser: So I use. I use a service called Boomerang. It's just an add on to your.17800:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.850The Alliance: Oh, right? Yeah. You can use boomerang, too.17900:26:57.091 --> 00:27:01.429Bruce Bowser: And I just I send myself so I'll add that to my list. So you know I send.18000:27:01.430 --> 00:27:08.930The Alliance: Yeah, I just, I just, I just like the reminders to think different. Because if you don't.18100:27:09.380 --> 00:27:16.170The Alliance: the brain's energy efficiency tendencies are gonna go for the same old, same old in any conditions other than like18200:27:16.240 --> 00:27:41.270The Alliance: I'm really fucking, relaxed. I had a cocktail. I'm chilling out. I'm looking at this. You know what I mean other than you're like telling your brain. Now is the time to do it, and I want my brain to be able to find those extra things in actual moments of stress, right? Like that's that's when you really need it. When the fucking company's falling apart. And you're in that meeting, and everybody's freaking out. Somebody's got to be able to think creatively in the room. Otherwise18300:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.040The Alliance: this ship goes down all right. The next18400:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.540The Alliance: you've got a couple of powerful tools. So far.18500:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.829Bruce Bowser: Yeah, thank, you.18600:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.090The Alliance: I have to say.18700:27:51.240 --> 00:27:58.709The Alliance: this is my favorite one of my favorite conversations I've had so far. Most people are are sort of18800:27:58.950 --> 00:28:04.932The Alliance: wrestling with goal setting stuff. They're still doing creative path finding right? You're actually18900:28:05.930 --> 00:28:19.082The Alliance: fully in on the creative training part. I think most people are. In fact, the next time I do this I'm gonna have to start with a creative path finding module cause. That's where almost everybody is.19000:28:19.690 --> 00:28:37.909The Alliance: I won't like, you know. I we'll talk about this next week, I think what we do because I can join the bear. I want to talk to people what they want to do, curriculum wise, because everybody is essentially doing creative pathfinding, which is, is great, because, like, I've got a great formal architecture for it. And it's always beneficial. But if we focus on that.19100:28:38.530 --> 00:28:44.940The Alliance: we may do a little less group flow or something else down the line. And I want to give people the option of what I think we could also do a makeup19200:28:45.110 --> 00:28:51.519The Alliance: zoom call kind of thing to cover some of the missing stuff, but I just wanted to put it to people. Alright! What else is up.19300:28:52.427 --> 00:28:54.512Bruce Bowser: What did I put down?19400:29:00.780 --> 00:29:12.591Bruce Bowser: yeah. So I think it ties into what we're talking about. But did you look at my challenges. It's like, and you get this because you you're you know, you understand the pet space a bit, the bed space. So19500:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.539Bruce Bowser: you know my business career.19600:29:15.680 --> 00:29:42.549Bruce Bowser: Success I've had is being. When I really focus on what can we do that differentiates ourselves? Not in that typical sort of differentiating. But what's really out there. So I've been, you know, giving a lot of thought over the last, you know, 6 to 12 months in the Vet. Space about what are the game changers that we can. And you know, if you have any ideas, I'd love them. But what are game changers that we can introduce to our business. So19700:29:43.147 --> 00:29:47.080Bruce Bowser: excuse me, it's a bit of a mom plus shop business.19800:29:47.569 --> 00:29:53.549Bruce Bowser: You know, some consolidation, but they haven't changed much, so so I've landed on a couple of things. And I'm19900:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.647Bruce Bowser: I'm just trying to think about how do I?20000:29:57.210 --> 00:30:05.918Bruce Bowser: you know, expand because, like what happens with me is I get these 2 things in my mind, so I'll tell you quickly what they are, and you can give me your your feedback on them.20100:30:07.360 --> 00:30:14.720Bruce Bowser: And so I I get fixated on those. And I'm just wondering, like, Am I, gonna you know, do some sort. So one of the things I'm kind of fixated on is.20200:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.930Bruce Bowser: I want to. I want our clinics to20300:30:19.260 --> 00:30:40.889Bruce Bowser: promote a program with Steven that tells him his Chihuahuas will live an average of 6 years longer if they do this, this and this right? I know it's true, right? So I know that. You know I've got 2 interns work for me that are doing tons of research. On what are the articles written about the extension of a pet's life? If their oral health is well looked after? Right, that's a big.20400:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.009The Alliance: Oh, well, I can add so so this is the work20500:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.810The Alliance: we've done like. If you read my book, small, furry prayer, like we have.20600:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.170Bruce Bowser: Like it started the fucking thing.20700:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.659The Alliance: Okay, so.20800:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.590Bruce Bowser: So that's.20900:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.159The Alliance: There's a there's a21000:30:52.440 --> 00:31:12.889The Alliance: we have a, and we're like, we're old school like we like old school vets who are like not gonna propose the $1,000 surgery when there's like a low tech like we. We're not. We're really old school that way. But so we used a handful of interventions, little bit of less sort of like raw food, nutrition.21100:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.305The Alliance: great dental care, as you pointed out, regular21200:31:20.280 --> 00:31:33.140The Alliance: like social time float like all this stuff that humans need to age. Well, we make sure dogs get blow time outdoor blah blah! We, our Chihuahuas, live into their twenties routinely like routinely.21300:31:33.250 --> 00:31:43.859The Alliance: You know what I mean, like routinely, all of our dogs live for freaking ever. And so yeah, there's there's like, I love that idea. So why, like, what's the downside here?21400:31:44.030 --> 00:32:03.140Bruce Bowser: Well, no, there's no downside. It's like, I'm kind of fixated on that. So now we're doing research because it's goofy. Things in the vet space are like, you can't advertise discounting. It's so regulated you can't advertise discounting. You can't make false claims. So I want to21500:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.130Bruce Bowser: do enough research that.21600:32:05.150 --> 00:32:27.520Bruce Bowser: Not only do I want to say, Hey, Steven, if you come to April vets with your dog, we can do this. I want to be able to say, Steven, if you come to your if you come to April vets with your new puppy for $27 a month, I love recurring revenue. It's like subscription based for $27 a month. We will, you know, maintain the oral health of your dog21700:32:27.530 --> 00:32:56.210Bruce Bowser: because it gets very expensive when you have to remove a shitload of teeth which is inhumane in my mind. I mean, I hate it seeing us do that. You know. We'll put your dog on the proper diet, based on what kind of dog you have. We'll do the tick treatments, whatever it is, and we come up with a recurring revenue, and we want you for the life of your pet. And we say, if you do these things, research shows right. Article by blah blah shows that this will extend the life of your dog by 5 to 10 years.21800:32:56.490 --> 00:33:06.039Bruce Bowser: So I you know that's a a big component, you know, part of the pushback I get sometimes from the vets is well. If we do that.21900:33:06.770 --> 00:33:35.420Bruce Bowser: we're going to lose out on oral surgery. I'm like that would be a great place to be somewhere down the road, like if we shifted all of our. If all of our animals are healthy, right, and live longer, and died healthy, which is the goal versus, you know, developing cancers and all sorts of other diseases. That's what we're about, right? So you can't be about head health. But say, well, we kind of want to, you know. Get dogs in here with rotten teeth that weren't looked after and charge $3,000. I'd love to see a day where you know22000:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.409Bruce Bowser: oral surgery is the least of what we do right.22100:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.310The Alliance: Well, the other the and the the other thing they're not realizing they're missing22200:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.210The Alliance: is like, are you familiar with the San Francisco biotech startup? Loyal.22300:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.370Bruce Bowser: No, I don't think so.22400:33:49.400 --> 00:33:59.707The Alliance: So loyal loyal is a loyal is a biotech that is entirely aimed at pet longevity. They just they they made history in22500:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.479The Alliance: 2023. They're the 1st FDA approved22600:34:04.590 --> 00:34:30.639The Alliance: drug for longevity, and it in large breed dogs like great Danes. They overproduce Igf one right? They grow really big as use, and it's accelerated, decrepitted as you age. Her drug lowers Igf run rates, and it's already it's moving. It's going to be on market in 28, and they believe it adds 2 to 4 years to a large breed life.22700:34:30.699 --> 00:34:35.670The Alliance: though my point is that what your guy, what your guys are missing is.22800:34:36.400 --> 00:34:53.330The Alliance: Yes, you're gonna miss out on the oral surgery. That fucking dog is gonna live 7 years longer. And then we've got loyal coming in with drugs. You're talking about lifetime customer value going through the fucking roof right like that's not.22900:34:53.330 --> 00:35:05.119Bruce Bowser: Yeah, you and I are on the same page, you know, from a business perspective. I see it, as you know, a much better business model. So I'm I'm that's 1 of the.23000:35:05.120 --> 00:35:10.904The Alliance: And it's also you could totally sell it to pet owners like it's gonna go like hotcakes. Man. You know it.23100:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.839Bruce Bowser: Yeah, exactly. So we. So that's my big.23200:35:13.840 --> 00:35:27.506The Alliance: And, by the way, I say, this is a guy who literally a kid you not as we do, Hospice care, and we do. We work rescues. We had to remove 18th yesterday. We did the exact surgery you said yesterday,23300:35:28.198 --> 00:35:42.359The Alliance: and the crazy thing is, the dog is already like bounced back this morning like I couldn't let. Yesterday was a rough day, but she I couldn't believe how well she was doing this morning. But yeah, I agree with you. I was like, oh, are you fucking? Getting the 18th is? It's that's so much trauma.23400:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.920Bruce Bowser: It's almost like it's almost inhumane. It almost says.23500:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.940The Alliance: Oh, no, it's not.23600:35:46.940 --> 00:35:55.159Bruce Bowser: Like if you and I had a kid that you know, at age 7 or 8 had to have tender their teeth removed because we didn't look after their teeth.23700:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.510The Alliance: I know.23800:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.030Bruce Bowser: Correct and.23900:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.786The Alliance: I know. I I agree with you.24000:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.589The Alliance: yeah, I think there, I think that I think that's lovely. There's a24100:36:06.600 --> 00:36:15.939The Alliance: do you ever want to go into the pet product space? I have an idea it's just it's I have a. I have a world class idea. It's necessary. It's important. I just don't want to do it.24200:36:16.540 --> 00:36:16.930Bruce Bowser: Okay.24300:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.089The Alliance: I don't mind figureheading it and talking about it, but I really like.24400:36:20.090 --> 00:36:20.440Bruce Bowser: Okay.24500:36:20.440 --> 00:36:32.602The Alliance: My wife doesn't want to do it here, because it'll get us all kinds of attention we don't want, but we've been. I've been trying to say that the biggest opportunity right now is in24600:36:33.570 --> 00:36:36.589The Alliance: houses built for human animal cohabitation.24700:36:37.550 --> 00:36:42.850The Alliance: As we live we cohabitate with large numbers of animals these days in boxes built for humans.24800:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.849The Alliance: So there's an entire market in actual, you know.24900:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.670Bruce Bowser: Of course.25000:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.979The Alliance: Furniture, peep proof. All that stuff. But where it gets really interesting is the following25100:36:55.640 --> 00:37:10.620The Alliance: animal use dog cat euthanasia. Numbers are through the roof, and we euthanize animals for 2 reasons. Well, one, because we don't license breeders, which is criminal. But besides that, the biggest, the second biggest problem there is25200:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.130The Alliance: most animal rescuers25300:37:13.810 --> 00:37:23.320The Alliance: who wanna adopt dogs and help solve this problem live in cities. Every fucking city in the world has well, in America. North America has zoning laws25400:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.480The Alliance: based on limited pets per household, and they exist for 2 reasons.25500:37:28.790 --> 00:37:32.720The Alliance: control feces and urine, and for noise25600:37:32.910 --> 00:37:48.000The Alliance: we can, fucking, make bark, proof walls and indoor pet bathrooms, and, in fact, we know, because they do it in Boston you can in. They recycle pet poop, and on the local parks in Boston use the methane to power the lights right.25700:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.989Bruce Bowser: Do that in Canada. Yeah.25800:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.760The Alliance: Okay. So like, I mean, we like all this stuff is a closed loop.25900:37:53.990 --> 00:38:01.260The Alliance: huge business opportunity. And nobody like. There's there's nobody in the space.26000:38:02.310 --> 00:38:09.753Bruce Bowser: There's a little bit of the the biodegradable stuff happening in Canada, which is kind of cool. So I was a partner in a company that developed these26100:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.340Bruce Bowser: this in ground26200:38:13.470 --> 00:38:40.792Bruce Bowser: dog poop collectors, where it would be like the size of a garbage, can cut into the ground with a water like a, you know, high pressure water hose, and you put them outside of condos and parks. So if you Googled, you know dog poop in Mississauga, Ontario. You'll see that the name of the company going full blank on it now, but they put those in there and they, you know I helped them develop a little26300:38:41.380 --> 00:39:10.070Bruce Bowser: Internet device that measures when the cans getting full right? And so when when the cans getting full, they have a schedule, and that's what they asked me, because I was transportation to get involved. It goes out with a pump truck and just literally takes the top off the thing pumps all the dog crap out, takes it to the methane station that has just been built in Mississauga. There is more dog shit in Mississauga, the city of Mississauga, right outside of Toronto. There's more dog shit in the city of Mississauga than there is human shit.26400:39:10.740 --> 00:39:18.073Bruce Bowser: It's like they built a plant. They built a methane producing electricity plant in Massag. So I think it's a26500:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.009Bruce Bowser: I think it's a great idea. So I'm yeah. I'd I'd be.26600:39:21.010 --> 00:39:36.850Bruce Bowser: I'm a partner. I'm a partner in a business that, and I try not to be too many businesses, I've said, unless it's in the pet space or the health space. I'm not doing it post selling my company. So partners in a business that is.26700:39:37.760 --> 00:40:06.159Bruce Bowser: I think I think it's super cool because I'm doing it. But it's like wellness is big space right now, like wellness is a big space like longevity and wellness. Big space. I don't open another clinic. So what we've done is I've worked with the design firm, and we will help create wellness rooms in your in your home. So we go in. We offer infrared saunas, red light, therapy Pmf. Mats. I love coal plunging. I know you don't. I do it every day, so we will take.26800:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.120The Alliance: Oh, no, I take cold. I take cold showers every day.26900:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.200Bruce Bowser: Okay, cool.27000:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.958Bruce Bowser: I just don't like I just the the actual cold plunges.27100:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.799The Alliance: Don't agree with me. I don't. Thermo regulate.27200:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.510The Alliance: No, I don't.27300:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.870Bruce Bowser: News.27400:40:19.870 --> 00:40:36.019The Alliance: I lost my ability to thermoregulate when I got lyme disease. So I can like I can get super cold, really fast and drop. It looks like I'm having a heart attack, and cold plunges can put me in the position to have that problem, so I haven't figured out how to solve it.27500:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.808Bruce Bowser: Yeah, no, I'm not I. I've got lyme disease pretty bad myself. So27600:40:40.280 --> 00:40:59.560Bruce Bowser: I'm surprised I didn't have that issue. But anyway, look at a great lime, Doc, up here. So so the wellness space, you know the idea of doing something like that in human pets to me is like a no brainer. It's like, you know, if and if you have ideas you want to share with me, I'm happy to to do, you know, to look at doing, incorporating it, and somehow.27700:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.410The Alliance: Well, I always27800:41:00.740 --> 00:41:11.129The Alliance: like I called. I mean, I've got. I've got document. I got a show. I'll share it with you, Brooke. I've got like I called it the Cohabitation Project. I was going to fundraise around it. And what we realized is27900:41:12.180 --> 00:41:41.900The Alliance: because we're still trying to run under the we like. We lost our sanctuary license. We moved to Reno. So we're we have an illegal number of dogs again. I don't want any attention for our dogs at this point, like, I just want to fund our shit out of my pocket until, like my wife solves all the legal stuff, and then we can be visible again. But until that I'm not doing it for her, it's it's it's her mission. She's got a he's gonna steer that one. But until that like this is one where I'm like, I like one. I think it's28000:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.420The Alliance: pieces. I mean, the28100:41:45.620 --> 00:42:00.789The Alliance: pet products is like one. It like, it's an unstoppable business, and it's recession proof, as you learned right? So I like. I've been looking at it for a while going. This is really cool, and I should be a spokesperson for this and I would love to.28200:42:00.790 --> 00:42:05.169Bruce Bowser: To me. It's in my space, right? So it's it's in the pet and wellness.28300:42:05.170 --> 00:42:13.660The Alliance: I'll operate like I'll I'll when this call is over. I'll just email you all the shit I put together over the years. Take like me out of it. Then you could like.28400:42:14.250 --> 00:42:24.619Bruce Bowser: So, my girlfriend, when I'm not being an asshole. We've been, you know, together, on and off for the last couple of years. She? Unfortunately, it's more often than not. She28500:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.049Bruce Bowser: she rescues. She rescues. She started Rescue Center.28600:42:30.210 --> 00:42:50.625Bruce Bowser: She started Rescue Center in Turks and Caicos for pot cake dogs, and she's got like the best, and that she's brought 3 of them home. But we go to Turks and Caicos, and she's, you know, working in the center. She has horses, dogs, that's part of the issues like horses, dogs, cats, members, right? And it's like it's it's all good.28700:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.290Bruce Bowser: But28800:42:53.200 --> 00:43:01.530Bruce Bowser: I've said, heard of not just. They have a beautiful family, has a beautiful farm up in the country here Big Horse Farm, 100 acres.28900:43:01.670 --> 00:43:10.569Bruce Bowser: Her Dad, who's a very successful business. Guy, shut the fucking dogs up, and I'm like John like these dogs just didn't appear like you've been around forever like29000:43:10.809 --> 00:43:32.589Bruce Bowser: you should be used to by now, and he's the older gets the more cantancracy gets about the dog. So I said to Melissa, like, Why don't we, dog proof the house a little bit like, why don't we put like a you know, money is not an issue. Build like a, you know, a separate entrance for the dog, so they can come and go a little bit. Why don't we? You know she's like he's like the dog pissed on the floor. It's like, well, they're kind of walled.29100:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.779The Alliance: Why don't we have drains in the floor? Why don't we have drains.29200:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.010Bruce Bowser: No, we do, we do. We do so our vet clinic when I so when I'm building vet clinics29300:43:40.200 --> 00:44:02.260Bruce Bowser: and I go back to the vet, they said, you know, what are we learning from clinic? One to clinic 2. And now doing 5 and 6 and one of the big things like Bruce like, why don't we put drains in the dog like where the dogs come and and are there for the day? Why don't we put drains? And we, you know, we got to take the dogs out and we miss it. They piss, and that, you know they don't feel good about it. Why don't we just put drains there and put a frigging fire hydrant?29400:44:02.340 --> 00:44:15.589Bruce Bowser: We're doing that in our new clinics. So where the dogs are, they come out and said, take them outside and worried about shit happening. We had a fire little fire hydrant there, some fake grass, and it's over drain and dog pisses, and we hose it down simple, right? Everything.29500:44:16.340 --> 00:44:23.479The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, like we so down for falls are literally29600:44:23.820 --> 00:44:53.729The Alliance: insulation and eggshells. Right? You just put a fucking layer of eggshells on the other side of the insulation, and what I was thinking with with the dogs is like with my wife as we were thinking about this is, could we like build like baby monitors for dogs, so you can like direct the sound around the house so that owners can hear it. And but it doesn't. It? Doesn't go outside. Was what was another one but shoot proof, furniture, peep, proof, furniture like dog like29700:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.860The Alliance: dog furniture that is meant to like shed dog hair, like all those things, are absurd.29800:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.270Bruce Bowser: Share, share your ideas with me, and I will incubate them, because, like.29900:45:04.644 --> 00:45:18.510The Alliance: Been like this to be as a no brainer, and I could literally stand at a stage and talk about it already. Because we've been doing it for years. I just want somebody to do it.30000:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.640Bruce Bowser: Yeah. So those are the things that you know that I'm trying to.30100:45:23.070 --> 00:45:27.670The Alliance: Okay, you told me that was one. So one is the longevity program which I love. What's the other one.30200:45:31.560 --> 00:45:37.369Bruce Bowser: Well, it was. No, it's it's more the like switching to a subscription based program.30300:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.960The Alliance: I see.30400:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.815Bruce Bowser: Not just for longevity. But here's the issue, like I mean, are. There's a lot of30500:45:46.870 --> 00:46:00.370Bruce Bowser: 20 to 25 year olds that are out on their own that have a pet. And they really can't afford traditional bed service. Right? And I'm like guys, let's capture them, even if we got to do it at30600:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.230Bruce Bowser: like almost a loss. If we had to30700:46:04.540 --> 00:46:14.490Bruce Bowser: invite young people to have their pets to bring them here, so we can care for them on a $17 a month program. Initially, they're going to become.30800:46:15.180 --> 00:46:40.259Bruce Bowser: you know, successful somewhere down the road, you know, more financially successful. And we want, you know, if we truly care about animals right? Which is why we're in the business, we truly care about animals and their health. We shouldn't be shunning people that can't afford. And that's that's what happens. Like, you know, if you if you can't afford like. Sorry we can't help you right. It's like like I don't. And they're like, well, somebody will abuse it if they find out. You know, we do stuff like that free. I'm like, nobody's gonna abuse it right? Like it's you know.30900:46:40.430 --> 00:46:55.629Bruce Bowser: we're not opening the floodgates to a world of stupid people. We're opening the floodgates to a world of future pet owners that can afford to step it up and add more right like I didn't start off with the fucking. Bentley. I step. You know31000:46:55.830 --> 00:47:21.479Bruce Bowser: it's funny how you go up and down. I mean, I start out with a honda right? And, you know, got a Bmw. And they got a whatever, and they got a Bentley. And now I'm back down to a Volkswagen. It's like that's how life goes when you when the way we roll. But it's like you want them for the life. So my second, you know, project is, how can we create an innovative program that allows us to service31100:47:21.850 --> 00:47:37.730Bruce Bowser: pet owners at all different levels, so tends to be a bit of a stuffy business, right? It's like, you know, unless you come with a credit card and you know, it's like even the emergency. So that's 1 thing. And that's sort of the 3rd thing which is super cool, which we're gonna start doing is31200:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.230Bruce Bowser: my clinics for the most part run31300:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.720Bruce Bowser: the 8 to 5, 8 to 6.31400:47:44.960 --> 00:48:09.980Bruce Bowser: We're going to try a project. So I'm talking about the vets on Saturday, where we convert our clinics from daytime clinics to emergency aftercare clinics at the end of the day. So from when when our regular team leaves at 6 o'clock. I have 2 emergency docs that are partners that come in, and they take over the clinic from 6 pm. To 6 Am. With vet Texas, with people that you know, work those shifts.31500:48:09.990 --> 00:48:22.130Bruce Bowser: and it becomes instead of buying 2 buildings instead of having 2, you know, separate ors, instead of having 2 overheads, we have one, and they share it. So I'm trying to sell them on that. That31600:48:22.794 --> 00:48:28.560Bruce Bowser: you know, because right here, like our model is to have 3 to 5 clinics31700:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.120Bruce Bowser: per area. So in Halifax31800:48:32.500 --> 00:48:47.690Bruce Bowser: have 5 clinics they support. That's enough business to support an emergency center. That's enough business for hiring an orthopedic surgeon. It, you know, brings the masses to it. So yeah, that's where I'm31900:48:48.270 --> 00:48:54.200Bruce Bowser: creative. There, I mean, I'm not gonna boast, but the other shit I do. We'll talk about that another time. But32000:48:55.390 --> 00:49:12.649Bruce Bowser: you know just even some of the stuff we talked about here. Like, you know you talk about serendipity. I'm in London. 3 of the most fascinating classes we did a half day. Classes were on Chat Gpt like I mean, I knew a little bit about Chat Gpt. But32100:49:13.140 --> 00:49:34.599Bruce Bowser: putting chat gpt on steroids is you know, loading information into the so one is asking long questions which you probably already know. So you know, I would normally ask a quick question. Chat. Bd, the guy that taught us the course of no, you want to be 100 to 400 words minimum to to effectively do it. And then with the Chat Gpt pro.32200:49:34.600 --> 00:49:57.150Bruce Bowser: you can upload files and documents into there. So it's not just searching the web. You're uploading things of relevance into it. And then you ask, Chat gpt a long question that says, you know, based on the information I've just uploaded about pet longevity about this and that, based on what you can scrub from the web. What do you think our best program should look like. That's not a long enough question.32300:49:57.150 --> 00:50:04.680The Alliance: I mean, you can absolutely do that. You got so Chatgptv has a ton of32400:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.146The Alliance: blind spots, and where it gets really good is when you get it to iterate on itself. So32500:50:11.940 --> 00:50:21.800The Alliance: no, it's an iterative product like, like, just know that like, until you sort of get to know how it thinks it can lull you into bad decisions sometimes.32600:50:22.140 --> 00:50:22.700Bruce Bowser: Said.32700:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.954The Alliance: Yeah. So let me ask you32800:50:28.420 --> 00:50:37.670The Alliance: a couple of questions. It seems like nights and weekends is 1st right. Do you have an order to these, how you're thinking about these projects. And32900:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.000The Alliance: second.33000:50:39.350 --> 00:50:44.000The Alliance: well, let me let me let me say the other thing first, st and then then we'll talk about the order.33100:50:44.050 --> 00:50:45.130Bruce Bowser: 1st is this.33200:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.150The Alliance: If I was trying to con. If I was trying to convince.33300:50:50.090 --> 00:51:06.389The Alliance: That's this like, if I was like, I would like I would be like. I would be like, I would be ruthless like Google. And here's what I mean. Years ago, this is really the fucking, craziest thing I've ever heard they wanted to know what's the best way to inspire employees.33400:51:06.750 --> 00:51:15.119The Alliance: So they ran dying experiments. Some guys got small raises. Some guys got big raises. Some people got vacation time. Some people got33500:51:15.450 --> 00:51:20.500The Alliance: coupons to go eat. Some people got group activities. One group got a hug.33600:51:21.370 --> 00:51:37.160The Alliance: So could you imagine, by the way, later on, when this came out, if you were in the group that got a hug, your buddy got a $10,000 raise you got a hug like, how long would you do you quit? Is my. It's my 1st question. But anyways, what I would do is33700:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.255The Alliance: I would say, Okay, we've got33800:51:39.940 --> 00:51:52.560The Alliance: 2 different clinics, one on, you know, each side of town in Vancouver, or wherever we're gonna run one we're gonna we're gonna do an offer to clients at. We're like33900:51:52.630 --> 00:52:04.050The Alliance: they come in, and they can have in one clinic. They get regular vet service for a year at like a slight discount, because at the end of the year we want to run a a battery diagnostics on your dog34000:52:04.060 --> 00:52:29.329The Alliance: and and the other clinic. You run the same way, you and then you have a different clinic on the subscription model, and you run the same diagnostics at the end of the year and just see like, just start to get. I mean one. That's data you would want anyways, right? But like you can start to prove out, hey? The financials work out. They make sense. The other thing is this vet business are going to be so much shorter34100:52:29.360 --> 00:52:40.142The Alliance: because they're not going to be dealing with as many catastrophic things because things are going to get caught ahead of time. I think you're gonna actually end up doing more. Though.34200:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.159The Alliance: what? Where I think. So what worries me about the subscription model.34300:52:46.870 --> 00:52:52.900The Alliance: Is this the advantage of description model is I me. The consumer34400:52:53.870 --> 00:53:01.560The Alliance: wants to spend a little less and get better quality. Care for the dog. Right like. That's my motivation is better quality. Care for the dog is.34500:53:01.950 --> 00:53:16.731The Alliance: you know, depending on where I am financially one that's either priority, one or priority. But those are the 2 things that that are drawing me to the service. But you know that regular checks are going to lead to. Oh, this is happening. And34600:53:17.290 --> 00:53:29.110The Alliance: we should run this test, this test and this test, because the modern Vet world is built on these really expensive diagnostic models that's gonna break your low income subscribers.34700:53:29.940 --> 00:53:37.584The Alliance: That's my like. That's my question is, how do you handle the diagnostics that show up along the way for people who can't afford them.34800:53:38.620 --> 00:53:46.090Bruce Bowser: Yeah, that look. I hate to sound like I get answers to everything. But that's 1 of the things that you know had popped up on our radar as a34900:53:48.250 --> 00:54:11.460Bruce Bowser: an efficiency tool down the road. So I've been talking to a group that says, Hey, look! We can we can build your own lab right? So you don't need to like the lab companies, a company called Idex, which is owned by Mars, which is, controls the pet food world and all the other shit. They hose us right? So they charge us, we'll say $125 for the test.35000:54:11.680 --> 00:54:17.033Bruce Bowser: We charge the pet owner $200 for the test, in fact.35100:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.809Bruce Bowser: you know the if we do it ourselves.35200:54:20.810 --> 00:54:22.250The Alliance: Just 20 bucks.35300:54:22.250 --> 00:54:29.180Bruce Bowser: $12 right? But so I'll give you a better example, because this is one that I am working on. And again, to give you a sense of you know where my brain's at. It's like35400:54:29.300 --> 00:54:42.832Bruce Bowser: in the Us. You guys have already started. So one of the Senators has proposed a bill to reduce the cost of drugs to to pet owners. Right? So drugs are expensive. Here's what happens in Canada. And it's the same in the Us.35500:54:43.650 --> 00:55:01.830Bruce Bowser: 30, 40, 50 years ago a group of of vets got together and came up with this clever idea. We'll be the middle man. We'll buy the drugs from the manufacturers, and we'll sell them to the vet clinics. So they became the middle. It's kind of like a co-OP, but the co-OP is so fucking wealthy that they built it into their own little business, and they own it.35600:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.630Bruce Bowser: so manufacturer makes a pill, sells it to the middleman for a dollar35700:55:07.740 --> 00:55:24.300Bruce Bowser: middleman marks it up to $8 and sells it to the vet clinic for $9. The vet. Sells it to you for $12. They make up, you know, a margin, but nothing like that. You're saying, fuck. Why am I paying $12 for pill that I can see? It's the same as a human pill. It's like a $3 pill.35800:55:24.590 --> 00:55:49.160Bruce Bowser: So I went to see these guys right. And they said, Son, we're good, and I'm like, I hate being called fucking son. Right? It's like, especially by my peers. And I'm not like a you know. Years ago I said, Fuck, you guys, and with, you see, you haven't heard that of me. I'm like, look, we're growing. We're gonna you know. We're gonna have 1,500 clinics here. You gotta talk to us. Come back. When you have 1,500 clinics we'll talk. Maybe we'll give you a little discount.35900:55:49.690 --> 00:56:02.559Bruce Bowser: So in my mind, I started thinking, you know, through the process which I understand far better now. How can I? And they said, I said, Well, I'll just go to the manufacturer. Good luck with that, son. They're not going to talk to you. We're the biggest buyer in Canada.36000:56:02.800 --> 00:56:10.034Bruce Bowser: like, okay? Okay, okay, serendipity. One of my neighbors owns loblaws, which is the largest36100:56:10.590 --> 00:56:19.060Bruce Bowser: grocery store chain in Canada which also owns shoppers. Drug mart would be the same as your largest. What do you call the what's a shoppers down there, I forget. What are your drugstores?36200:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.560Bruce Bowser: Give me a big change.36300:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.070The Alliance: Walmart, like our Walmart.36400:56:22.070 --> 00:56:49.840Bruce Bowser: Walgreens. Yeah. Walgreens, yeah. So it would be as big as Walgreens. So every there's thousands of them in Canada. So I reach out to him is, Hey, look! I talked to people at the shoppers. Drug Mart, and he said, Why, sometimes, pet, he said, fuck, we're looking at the pet space. We just have space, that's, you know, so valuable. So I meet with the president of their shoppers. Drug mart turns out we're both in the East coast. Blah blah! Now we did it off, and I start telling what the dilemma is, I said, look at. And I'm 1 of these guys that you know.36500:56:49.980 --> 00:57:09.639Bruce Bowser: thinks he's half clever. So I try to look at deals from both sides. And I'm like, Hey, look at! Here's our problem. I can't buy from manufacture because we're not big enough. You guys are way fucking bigger than any of these guys you could buy from them. I think. You know, if if I could buy the drug from you for $2 you buy for a dollar I buy from you for 2, and I sold for 4.36600:57:10.027 --> 00:57:18.080Bruce Bowser: We're all happy, he said. Fuck, I'd be real happy making a buck out of pill, he said. We don't make a bucket of pill, and I said, the other thing is, I said, if if my36700:57:18.340 --> 00:57:40.140Bruce Bowser: pet owner comes in here and I renew the prescription, so we have an app right. We're the only freaking April. That's the only significant vet clinic that has that we spent a half 1 million bucks on this app. It has your prescription rules on it. If I send you my prescription rules to shoppers with my pet owners. You think they're going to go somewhere else to buy their other human drugs. He's like you're getting my attention right.36800:57:40.300 --> 00:57:53.960Bruce Bowser: and I said, and all of your shop, dogmaster beside one of your super stores, the grocery stores. They're coming there. Where are they going to get their milk right. So now we're, you know, a mile down this road, you know, a 5 mile road, a mile down this road of36900:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.909Bruce Bowser: potentially changing that. And I gotta37000:57:57.090 --> 00:58:03.079Bruce Bowser: sell the bets on it right? It's like, I'm so used being a business where it's like, yeah, I like to get team involvement. But you know.37100:58:03.210 --> 00:58:06.246Bruce Bowser: at the end of day, sometimes my line was, hey?37200:58:06.998 --> 00:58:12.669Bruce Bowser: let's pretend I own the company, and we're just gonna do it this way, like, I appreciate everybody's opinion. But this way we're gonna do it.37300:58:12.840 --> 00:58:17.940Bruce Bowser: I can't really do that with with these guys. But so there's a good example of something that you know37400:58:19.430 --> 00:58:49.029Bruce Bowser: other than me boasting a little bit. That whole cycle of what's the problem problem is, somebody's gonna come in and regulate the pharmaceuticals in Canada. If I can do this one, I'm a white knight. I can use my app right, even though my apps is April vets. I can change it to Cottler Vets tomorrow and say, Stephen, you and your wife can use our app. It does all these things great things. We'll put cottler vets on the top of it, and you can now buy your drugs37500:58:49.110 --> 00:58:54.420Bruce Bowser: at this low rate and turn the business upside down.37600:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.149Bruce Bowser: And, by the way. Our friend Stephanie thinks that's a great idea, too.37700:59:01.490 --> 00:59:06.210The Alliance: It is a great idea. My wife would love it, because you know.37800:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.240Bruce Bowser: You get hosed.37900:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.609The Alliance: We get hosed on on drugs.38000:59:10.240 --> 00:59:30.670Bruce Bowser: I mean, the sad part is like my daughter's a vet, and my buddy, you know, who's an old mma fighter that, you know has a dog cheap as shit. Doesn't have any money. He's always asked my daughter, like you know my dog's at this, and my daughter, like his dog, she said. Look at. I'll give you a prescription. Just go to shoppers with the same drug. It's as human drug. It's just $6 instead of $60. Right?38100:59:30.780 --> 00:59:35.789Bruce Bowser: So it everybody knows it. We just need to change it. So that's why.38200:59:35.790 --> 00:59:36.340The Alliance: That's great.38300:59:36.340 --> 00:59:36.710The Alliance: Oh, gosh!38400:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.579The Alliance: So I be like38500:59:39.930 --> 00:59:45.162The Alliance: like one. It does not sound like you were all that short on creative ideas to38600:59:46.270 --> 00:59:51.480The Alliance: Have you got this all sequenced out, you know, like what's first? st I mean you. You seem like you're on top of it.38700:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.739Bruce Bowser: Yeah, I mean.38800:59:52.740 --> 00:59:58.919The Alliance: This is a lot of this. This is a lot of stuff I'd like to see. You know. I'd run the 100 steps exercise on it.38900:59:59.790 --> 01:00:21.390Bruce Bowser: Yeah. Well, I I look what I'm gonna do next. If you ask me, what's my low hanging fruit here, I'm gonna start using one chat gpt to help me get more creative and to find connections. I'm gonna load up. All these things I've worked on and ask for connections. Because I do. I do believe that I mean, you know, I I was going through some notes you know, prior to our call.39001:00:21.390 --> 01:00:43.209Bruce Bowser: I really need to put more humor in my life because it's like it's it's just a little too serious than with all I've been doing. I run an orthopedic hospital. And I'm doing these bed startups. I don't watch TV. I've never watched TV. So I'm going to start watching a little TV. Of course, I I fuck it up by on the way back from London, England. I had some extra time, and so I'll watch a show and39101:00:43.618 --> 01:00:47.369Bruce Bowser: I watched the Bob Dylan movie. I don't know if you've seen it.39201:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.000The Alliance: Oh, yeah, I have seen it.39301:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.860Bruce Bowser: Don't think I laughed once. It's like it was depressed.39401:00:52.860 --> 01:00:58.667The Alliance: Yeah, that wasn't a fun. That's not a funny movie I like, that's not. That wouldn't be ideal.39501:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.760Bruce Bowser: I thought it would make me smile. Cheers.39601:01:00.760 --> 01:01:06.150The Alliance: Here with your do you know about?39701:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.580The Alliance: I don't even know. I should tell you this, Anthony Jesselnik.39801:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.979Bruce Bowser: Is he a comedian.39901:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.029The Alliance: He's the comedian.40001:01:15.390 --> 01:01:16.709Bruce Bowser: How do you spell his last name?40101:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.890The Alliance: JE.40201:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.689The Alliance: SSEL, NICK.40301:01:22.200 --> 01:01:29.960The Alliance: So cause you have the bluntest, most fucked up sense of humor.40401:01:30.080 --> 01:01:45.730The Alliance: I've said to you to Anthony. There's I don't think there's anybody who like pushes boundaries more than this dude right now. He's funny. And you could Microdose with him like 10 min.40501:01:45.730 --> 01:01:51.835Bruce Bowser: I need that. I need that I need that I mean. So you know, when you're asking Ryan for you know, accountability. It's like40601:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.920The Alliance: No, let's do like like microdosing with comedy is really funny.40701:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.460Bruce Bowser: I got to do it. That's like a that's of the 3 things the one.40801:02:01.460 --> 01:02:05.980The Alliance: No, I like. So I here's the interesting thing like you said it.40901:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.180The Alliance: and my brain is like, wait a minute.41001:02:10.050 --> 01:02:11.070The Alliance: A bat.41101:02:11.350 --> 01:02:17.470The Alliance: Theoretically, if you microdosed with comedy, I don't know. It's41201:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.000The Alliance: 5 days a week for 8 weeks.41301:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.950The Alliance: and we measured flow at the end.41401:02:23.430 --> 01:02:42.520The Alliance: Bet we find there's more flow in your life because there's gonna be more dopamine. There's gonna be more like random connections. And it's gonna like it's a low hanging flows, fruit flow study. You know what I mean like. Oh, it's right there. We should just do that at some point. Because the protocol is pretty straightforward. It was just a bitch to monitor41501:02:44.250 --> 01:02:53.639The Alliance: unless you made them come in and watch. Actually, I can solve that. So anyways. I love the mic. So you're microdosing with comedy. You're microdosing with creativity. You're41601:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.090The Alliance: got a daily release activity built in.41701:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.920The Alliance: And the other thing, I think.41801:03:01.654 --> 01:03:01.979Bruce Bowser: Me!41901:03:03.390 --> 01:03:04.940The Alliance: You should do42001:03:05.160 --> 01:03:12.254The Alliance: is take every one of these ideas that we're talking about after chat. Gbt, sort of choose on them for a little while, and42101:03:14.790 --> 01:03:36.200The Alliance: like. Let's say it's let's call it a massively transformative purpose is open. The vet clinic of the future. Right? Let. And let's like the goal is just to get one like you just want the 1st model to test, even like we'll start there, which is not, is pretty low hanging fruit for you? But between here and there there are at least a hundred steps.42201:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.030The Alliance: So what are they42301:03:38.460 --> 01:03:53.189The Alliance: right like? What are what are the 100 steps. You as a businessman, pet lover, can already see, and then you just start to fill in the gaps between them. But I think if you start to list those things out. All these various42401:03:53.518 --> 01:04:05.439The Alliance: wrongs are gonna start together into a single, come into a single list and like, if you just get it all in a list. The next step is, once you got the 100 steps, or whatever you know what I mean, like. Usually when I do this exercise42501:04:05.440 --> 01:04:25.019The Alliance: like cause. I start out like I I'll include the marketing steps right? And there's 10 steps in the marketing of it, and then I'll include the like, you know, these are. This is what my staff is gonna complain about. So here's the like stuff. I gotta figure out those steps. I usually end up with way more than a hundred. But I I like this for 2 reasons. I like it, one because42601:04:25.340 --> 01:04:41.980The Alliance: I don't like to be blindsided by something on a to do list like nothing worse than like I open up a to do list and like this is the next thing I gotta do for my business, and I realize that it's a 3 month project, and I I don't even have staff for it, like, what was I thinking? You know what I mean. So I like to stay.42701:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.739Bruce Bowser: In our session. Yeah, yeah.42801:04:43.740 --> 01:05:12.280The Alliance: Stay way ahead of that stuff, and I also think that if you are constantly do, if you do the 100 steps, and then you start to think about, how do we organize it? Chronologically? What's first, st second, 3, rd to get you to clear goals all the like? How do you integrate these ideas together into a single fluid thing. And what do you get to say? No to right cause it, you know, like, it's clear that, like you're on the edge of stretch, too thin. You're not yet stretched too thin, but you're flirting a stretch too thin.42901:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.450Bruce Bowser: Yeah. Yeah. No, for sure.43001:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.329The Alliance: Now there's some.43101:05:19.330 --> 01:05:24.120The Alliance: and I, by the way, I don't think you're doing too much. I just don't think it's been properly sequenced.43201:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.540Bruce Bowser: Well, I just hired a president literally yesterday. Right? So I've hired.43301:05:27.540 --> 01:05:27.940The Alliance: Okay.43401:05:27.940 --> 01:05:50.510Bruce Bowser: For the vet clinic which you know, which we knew we're gonna do is just like as a startup. At what point do we? You know. Do we bring in a president? And you know now, with like 5 or 6 clinics under construction, and 4 more opening between now and September. We're we're, gonna you know, and another 15 in the pipeline. We're gonna keep growing. So and I can't function at the43501:05:50.620 --> 01:06:05.479Bruce Bowser: at that pace. So you know, it's good. So she's great. It's like a she, because 85% of the vets today graduating are females. So the last thing we need. And they mistrust men for some reason, like, I'm just telling you like it's I don't understand.43601:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.129Bruce Bowser: Oh, oh, yeah. So I mean, well, one of the things I was thinking.43701:06:10.330 --> 01:06:39.270The Alliance: So I was thinking about it. It was Stephanie, and I was thinking, this is true with almost every vet I've ever met. Especially the good ones. They're pretty weird. They're funky people. As a general rule, vets are not like they're they're they're much more closer to creatives than they are. You know what I mean? The gap between most vets and most doctors? Like, you know, my is enormous, and it's and it's because they're weirder.43801:06:39.410 --> 01:07:05.339The Alliance: but because they're weirder, especially because they're younger, right? Younger, weirder women were raised in a culture that does not like men. So they're coming in really distrustful of men and men in power they just are. It's that whole. It's millennials in general and the generation below them. And they distrust like. And if you're gonna have a man in power. He better be black and gay right now.43901:07:05.710 --> 01:07:08.439Bruce Bowser: Or in my case, the father of a vet44001:07:08.760 --> 01:07:23.349Bruce Bowser: who? I mean. That's giving me a little bit of you know they're not like, okay. So what do you? Why are you doing this? Why, like what? What's in this for you? And I'm like, Well, my daughter's a vet. And I got into to help her open a clinic, and I realized that you know, accessibility to ownership was not.44101:07:23.350 --> 01:07:28.950The Alliance: Oh, no, your story is great, and you you just did. I mean you did everything right. Your story is great. You need a woman like you hired like.44201:07:28.950 --> 01:07:29.539Bruce Bowser: Don't know how to play.44301:07:29.540 --> 01:07:38.265The Alliance: Like, yeah, yeah, exactly. You didn't. You nailed it like, that's a yes, yeah. You make you. You make. That was a smart business choice, I would have done the same, but could.44401:07:39.230 --> 01:07:45.289The Alliance: though, I will say, trying to find a woman who is at the top of neuroscience and can communicate really? Well.44501:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.410The Alliance: I can't find her.44601:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.936The Alliance: I swear to God I can't find her.44701:07:50.777 --> 01:07:58.292The Alliance: which is, really like difficult trying to like. Do what I do in today's world. It's really like, it's odd.44801:07:59.870 --> 01:08:03.049The Alliance: we are 5 min over. Is there anything I didn't cover? Is there.44901:08:03.050 --> 01:08:24.538Bruce Bowser: No, I came into this wondering. Okay, you know. What do I want to take away from this? And again, not to sound patronizing, but like I've got, you know, 5 pages of big, sticky notes of of the things I'm gonna go away with. So like when we're when we hang up. I'm I'm I'm Googling. Anthony Chessel neck45001:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.730The Alliance: Just like you laugh. Yeah, he's really. He's wildly inappropriate, wildly inappropriate. But, like45101:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.190The Alliance: Sarah Silverman is the female version of Anthony.45201:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.999The Alliance: Also, I can just like say.45301:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.810Bruce Bowser: I think I've I think I've heard of her.45401:08:39.819 --> 01:08:50.989The Alliance: Sarah Silverman, if you want to like, laugh really hard, you could watch her old special cheeses is magic. It's all kinds of wrong. And, by the way.45501:08:52.459 --> 01:08:55.059The Alliance: this is a funny story, and I'll tell it to you really quickly.45601:08:55.580 --> 01:09:14.840The Alliance: Sarah Silverman, who I knew in La, was really getting really famous, and she was doing this Jesus show for like one week only, and I was doing a big article on her, and I brought a date. I met this woman fashion designer Beautiful loved her clothes. Really. Interesting woman! Bring her to see this 1st date.45701:09:15.069 --> 01:09:15.950The Alliance: and45801:09:17.430 --> 01:09:27.930The Alliance: we go to see Sarah Silverman's Jesus magic, and right. Before we walk in I discover a number of unusual facts about my date.45901:09:28.090 --> 01:09:32.720The Alliance: One is a fundamentalist Christian that was Christian.46001:09:33.330 --> 01:09:34.210The Alliance: 2.46101:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.829The Alliance: Her godparents are Dick Cheney and James Watt.46201:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.089Bruce Bowser: Oh, beautiful. Yeah.46301:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.630The Alliance: So.46401:09:41.630 --> 01:09:50.404The Alliance: So I'm on a date with, like the most mobbed up Christian in the fucking world. And I brought her to see Jesus magic.46501:09:52.289 --> 01:09:54.549The Alliance: and she probably thinks it's something, you know.46601:09:55.089 --> 01:09:56.159Bruce Bowser: Significant, right.46701:09:56.160 --> 01:10:05.349The Alliance: He? Well, she knows she was an I mean she was in La. She was a fashion designer. She sort of like she knows she wasn't. She was. She did. She laughed. But afterwards she was like46801:10:05.490 --> 01:10:06.490The Alliance: Steven46901:10:06.710 --> 01:10:24.339The Alliance: Steven. If we're gonna have a second date we have to talk about some stuff and it was right around there that we decided to become friends. And yeah, I was like, I don't think this is, I don't think this is gonna work, and at least one, if not both, of your step. Parents are Satan. So I don't know what to do. Like.47001:10:24.765 --> 01:10:25.100Bruce Bowser: Yeah.47101:10:25.100 --> 01:10:32.509The Alliance: James Watt and Dick Cheney. Search scares me so I you know. But it was funny.47201:10:33.570 --> 01:10:39.360The Alliance: I ended up. She got into trouble at 1 point, and we had to get her out of trouble. It's a long story. But my phone rang one day47301:10:39.720 --> 01:10:45.190The Alliance: and it was picked it up. And I was like, Hello! And the person there went Steven.47401:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.070The Alliance: Yes, this is James Watt. Do you know who I am?47501:10:49.390 --> 01:11:02.679The Alliance: Holy shit! You're Satan! And he just started laughing. And I was like, Okay, I don't know what this is about, but whatever it is, you're okay, like, I just called you Satan. And you were laughing so okay, fair enough.47601:11:03.490 --> 01:11:04.750The Alliance: Alright.47701:11:04.860 --> 01:11:19.689The Alliance: I am glad you got a lot out of it. I am glad that it's still useful. I want to see where you're adding in in a little while, and I'll probably see you next Thursday, because I'm gonna be on the call just for a little while, and and then we will do next month.47801:11:20.250 --> 01:11:20.880Bruce Bowser: Of course.47901:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.440Bruce Bowser: Sure.48001:11:22.070 --> 01:11:29.310The Alliance: More and more and more have you been training with the flow triggers all, and focusing on those, seeing how they apply Nope48101:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.317The Alliance: clear goals, complete concentration, and and48201:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.609Bruce Bowser: I I literally am at no no good excuses other than I literally just got back from London, England.48301:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.139The Alliance: Well, I don't know how you do this shit. I don't know how you do this show on the road.48401:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.200Bruce Bowser: Yeah, you don't.48501:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.099The Alliance: I do my best on the road, but it's like, if I can manage to get the gym every day. That's okay.48601:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.229Bruce Bowser: Yeah, that's what I did over there. So but I will. I'll work on trading with the quote figures.
