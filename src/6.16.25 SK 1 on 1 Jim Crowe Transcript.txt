WEBVTT100:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.892The Alliance: How are you? It's nice to see you.200:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.310The Alliance: Let's jump in.300:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.880The Alliance: There's a bunch of accountability questions. I just want to see where you're at very quickly400:03:15.010 --> 00:03:24.350The Alliance: great of microdosing recovery, distraction, management, clear goals, skills, balance and the feedback list500:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.649The Alliance: playing with all those. What percentage of these things are we using scale of one to 10.600:03:34.470 --> 00:03:45.950James Crowe: So the the meditation thing I am doing and I like I've done.700:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.559James Crowe: You know, I800:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.680James Crowe: I I did the Youtube set you link to. I also use headspace myself already, which is pretty similar a lot of times that have.900:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.869James Crowe: And then I don't know. I mean, this might be your kind of thing, or maybe it's too Poppy. But do you know about Endel, the1000:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.900James Crowe: the app? They have kind of AI driven frequency generator of ambient stuff.1100:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.889James Crowe: and it actually connects in your iphone to your movement. So if you.1200:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.269James Crowe: you know, if you're walking or running, or whatever it's sort of.1300:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.169James Crowe: and then you can say, Tune me up or tune me down. And so I've actually been playing with that which I like a lot which is a little bit different. But it1400:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.460James Crowe: it's like.1500:04:33.460 --> 00:05:02.100The Alliance: So here's the thing I care about. And this is the reason I'm asking this question. So you answered my question, and this is the reason you got to care, and it's entirely up to you to decide. It's inquiry with here. So the program is entirely designed to work synergistically. The Pasta is a very specific meditation technique that has been shown repeatedly to enhance creativity. Right? That's why like. So we're doing it synergistically with the creative Microdosing1600:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.329The Alliance: to try to produce big effects. Now.1700:05:06.560 --> 00:05:20.639The Alliance: if you're like. My next question was, let's talk about some wins. What's going on. You you popped in. You were smiling. I wanna see like what's been working for you. Let's talk about some wins, because maybe you've got1800:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.890The Alliance: all the momentum you need, and that's not an issue we should address, but it's an inquiry.1900:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.629James Crowe: yeah, I guess I I mean, I talked to2000:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.489James Crowe: Ryan about this, too, like I already have played with things in these genres. And then.2100:05:45.720 --> 00:06:00.880James Crowe: in some cases I even had practices so like displacing what I haven't done, which I probably should have done was stop doing my typical program of whatever I do in these areas, and only do what you're saying. And I haven't done that. I.2200:06:01.490 --> 00:06:12.943The Alliance: It's just. I mean, it's a like honest to God. It's just. It's a question which, like, if I want to put it, Ridley, you gotta ask yourself, like you spent a bunch of money to jump in my program2300:06:13.850 --> 00:06:31.579The Alliance: and like, do you? If you know more than me about like human peak performance. Cool, he like, do you? You know what I mean? If you want to check out how it works together, I would try to like. I would try to do it together just because it was designed to work synergistically. That said.2400:06:31.700 --> 00:06:46.059The Alliance: you can do that whenever you don't have to like, if this is where you're at now, and it's working for you. And we have I care about. Are you moving? It's a creative velocity accelerator. I really want a really happy dude. It's 4 months from now, right like.2500:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.390James Crowe: There we go!2600:06:46.480 --> 00:06:58.146The Alliance: I got as far as I like that was I got a lot farther than I that I could have gone without them. Blah blah. So that's what I'm aiming at. I don't. I'm telling you like, why it was designed and built a certain way.2700:06:58.760 --> 00:07:13.380The Alliance: and it, the other thing about it is like, as you know, I like the really simple tools, because I don't think a lot of the whiz, bang! Tools were in in specifically like a lot of the the music stuff I've seen2800:07:14.250 --> 00:07:27.560The Alliance: is this weird they they get. They love their music, which I don't like. I'm not mad at them, for you know what I mean, like, it's usually sound guys building this shit. And what I don't know. If this is your experience. My experience has been with a bunch of them is that2900:07:28.030 --> 00:07:52.459The Alliance: they do. They'll do things like they'll do, try to break patterns and and make like the music moves a little too quickly when I've listened to sound and do sound meditation, I do like solitary Tibetan bells, and I try to listen to the end of the tone. And when people are trying to like, I know what they're trying to do, they're trying to engage my salience network. So my attention doesn't wander by disrupting subconscious patterns.3000:07:52.460 --> 00:08:03.479The Alliance: But I know what they're doing, and I just find it fucking, annoying. And it actually blocks my meditation. And I'm like, oh, that's interesting. I can't tell if it's just me, because I'm me, and I know what's going on.3100:08:03.500 --> 00:08:15.293The Alliance: or if, like, this is actually like, every time I meet somebody who's like. Oh, no, I've given this great juice out of this app. You gotta check it out. I'm like, huh! I wonder I haven't checked out that app, though, so I'll try it.3200:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.900James Crowe: Yeah.3300:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.190The Alliance: Are you? Tell me what's good? Tell me what's working? Tell me what's what's not working, and tell me we can troubleshoot today.3400:08:28.270 --> 00:08:34.850James Crowe: Well, I realized, I mean, I'm still struggling with what we talked about before. So when3500:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.300James Crowe: when all my systems are going, when I'm good, and everything around me is good.3600:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.920James Crowe: like I have extraordinary upside productivity, potential and creativity.3700:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.050James Crowe: But3800:08:51.270 --> 00:08:59.410James Crowe: this is getting at the over commitment and prioritization deal like. If everything's good, then I'm not over committed3900:08:59.590 --> 00:09:08.519James Crowe: right? But when there's glitches, then I am over committed, and like this season, right now.4000:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.559James Crowe: all hell's breaking out in multiple channels of my life.4100:09:13.690 --> 00:09:21.189James Crowe: And so, therefore, my my lack of ability to prioritize, which usually I can sort of hover at4200:09:21.410 --> 00:09:32.709James Crowe: super high red line. I can't keep up with it right now. So one I mean. I talked to some about Ryan, but, like my wife, literally said I might not want to be in this marriage about 3 months ago.4300:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.860James Crowe: and we have done multiple rounds of therapy over our 38 years of marriage like 10 or 12 times, and4400:09:39.540 --> 00:09:49.959James Crowe: you know, usually we sort of circle back, and we're making amazing progress. But it's very intensive therapy right now, and exercises at night fondness exercises. And4500:09:50.190 --> 00:10:05.300James Crowe: I mean, it's time intensive. It's emotionally intensive. It's going okay. It's actually going pretty well. But I'm just saying the cognitive load of that for me right now is very high, and it's very serious, and I want it to go well, and I put a lot of priority on that.4600:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.199James Crowe: Meanwhile the us. Government is totally giving me hell4700:10:10.380 --> 00:10:18.430James Crowe: like they're threatening. They've already canceled one of my grants. They're threatening to, you know. Kill a hundred 1 million dollars of my funding, and I'm like4800:10:18.820 --> 00:10:25.110James Crowe: trying to salvage that. I'm already riffing some people because we've lost some funding4900:10:25.330 --> 00:10:33.490James Crowe: on Friday. I'll I'll stop branding in a minute. On Friday I get an inquiry. I need a 1 day turnaround on this. Are you doing gain of function5000:10:34.030 --> 00:10:48.570James Crowe: experiments in your lab to escape therapies? Which is, they send people to jail for this, and they wanted a 1 day turnaround. They wrote me 4 30 pm. On Friday. Please respond. Of course I got to get lawyers involved, and5100:10:48.680 --> 00:10:55.230James Crowe: I could go to jail over this stuff. I didn't do any gain of function, but they moved the goalposts. They changed the definition.5200:10:55.370 --> 00:11:07.910James Crowe: So things that are required in my Federal contracts, they're now saying maybe gain a function and may be illegal and bad. So like I'm just saying you you talked about the shitstorm like stuff is happening.5300:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.579James Crowe: That is not usual.5400:11:13.010 --> 00:11:21.200James Crowe: And then I just can't do the usual stuff. So like also Friday, you know, I got proofs I get. I get 3 or 4 of these a month.5500:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.259James Crowe: They're due today. I untouched them.5600:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.730James Crowe: So I I'm kind of you know if we get back to. I'm trying to the.5700:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.010The Alliance: Let me so.5800:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.730James Crowe: The creative activities. And all this while just all hell's breaking.5900:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.420The Alliance: Oh, dude!6000:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.239James Crowe: Oh, my God!6100:11:37.240 --> 00:11:53.249The Alliance: I, yeah, no, I. Okay. So one. Let's start at the beginning. Holy crap, that's a lot. And I'm just like, I'm sorry. That's really heavy, like legit heavy. No way around it like that's it's all fronts. It's heavy and6200:11:55.980 --> 00:12:04.869The Alliance: without the government involvement like I I went through that almost about a year ago, where, like Joy and I were like done and trying to save us6300:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.200The Alliance: dot com.6400:12:06.660 --> 00:12:27.960The Alliance: My in the Frc. Was starting to like, you know we would. We've been talking about, do we should have done, do we not? And like the model that we hadn't been rebuilding, and we knew was broken, was the reason, and like somebody was like, Oh, it's it! Holy shit! It's broken like it's like we have to move now, or right like it like that was I was. I'm so it was literally like.6500:12:28.120 --> 00:12:55.609The Alliance: and I was literally, and dogs started dying. My favorite dogs in the hospital, like one after another we lost 3 in a row, and by like and I was nuts, I mean I was. I would like I couldn't. I had no control of my emotions. I was so overloaded that I just like I lost for a couple of days. And it scared myself. I was like Whoa! I've never! I've never! I've never seen this before what the fuck is going on. And Annie, by the way, was one of the one of the people I.6600:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.120James Crowe: Worked with a little bit. So that was one of the reasons she came in.6700:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.130James Crowe: That's amazing.6800:13:00.130 --> 00:13:00.730The Alliance: He's a mess.6900:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.619James Crowe: Woman was okay. But she was amazing.7000:13:03.620 --> 00:13:32.580The Alliance: Sarah's actually as amazing as Annie, and I think I tapped her on for you guys, I thought, I think I let us freestyle. Annie stayed really focused on one topic so you could see out her kung Fu better. I think that was. I think that's I said. I said this to Ryan today. I was like, I think I screwed up the Sarah thing cause Sarah's actually as fucking crazy, impressive as Annie, and if she wasn't, I did something that's on me, and how I.7100:13:32.580 --> 00:13:32.940James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.7200:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.059The Alliance: Deployed her in the room.7300:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.569James Crowe: Folder, but it was a Thank God!7400:13:35.570 --> 00:14:02.532The Alliance: It, but it was also the difference, I think, was that that one everybody was very work, more comfortable with each other, good around each other a bunch. We're gonna open up. Sarah was like, sort of like the 1st turns out, because I just trust her immensely. So she doesn't care what she's my friend. She can handle whatever happens. And she's really good at it. Annie is a friend, too, but she's more about like no, no, we gotta have our shit together if we're gonna bring Annie into the room right like. Anyways.7500:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.971The Alliance: let me talk about a couple of things, so let me.7600:14:07.420 --> 00:14:14.399The Alliance: the and I don't know how much wisdom I have here, but it seems to me like7700:14:15.250 --> 00:14:36.990The Alliance: you've moved from sort of normal into crisis like this. This actually sounds like crisis. This doesn't sound like abnorm like, it doesn't sound like the standard tools or like we could go through them. But I believe that there's 2 tools. I I would think about one. You're gonna fucking hate. But the simplicity of it is really gonna work for you.7800:14:37.299 --> 00:14:46.259The Alliance: And the other is going to be really useful. So the 1st one is Sarah Sarkis's wisdom in a crisis. If you can see 3 steps ahead, you're winning.7900:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.460James Crowe: Hmm.8000:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.690The Alliance: So8100:14:48.830 --> 00:15:06.980The Alliance: don't expect like, especially guys like us who go, who can go like your job is literally 3 steps ahead. Execute. Okay, I'm here. What are the next 3 steps execute? I'm here like you shrink it. A lot of that will just help the other sections. This is the big tool. And this is8200:15:07.540 --> 00:15:15.520The Alliance: We do this with Ceos. We used to do this a lot with with Frc, people hate it. But like literally, the task is.8300:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.190The Alliance: pick a start, time for your work, pick an end time for your work and8400:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.709The Alliance: get to it, no matter what, and cut your workload8500:15:26.850 --> 00:15:44.860The Alliance: across the top by 20%. Force yourself to say, I've got to cut my workload by 20%. This is and what it does, is it it because you. If you stick to it, you'll have to. You have to reprioritize, and it's like, it's the but I I'm listening to you. I'm not like.8600:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.670The Alliance: like.8700:15:47.130 --> 00:16:04.001The Alliance: are we like meaning like of this? The 1st thing you gotta look at is of this like, where where can you find endpoints? They're like, where, if there's not really an endpoint to the wife. Right? You just lean in until like it works right? Basically8800:16:04.360 --> 00:16:19.589James Crowe: Well, you know that in a weird way is doing what you're saying, because I like to stay up till 3 30 in the morning and work my ass off. She would like me to get in bed with her at 9 o'clock when she goes to bed, and I am doing that8900:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.650James Crowe: which you know cuts off like 6Êh my day. So9000:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.460James Crowe: this is part of my time crisis. In a way, it's a i i'm a.9100:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.830The Alliance: I got it.9200:16:29.830 --> 00:16:43.049James Crowe: Into it, because it's a good thing, at least, for now it's good, it's just. I do have an end time, which is my wife turns out the lights. I better be near the bed. Not just to be in the bed with her, you know. It's a.9300:16:43.650 --> 00:16:50.540The Alliance: Got it. No, I mean, 1st of all, like the other thing about that is because Joy and I are have radically different schedules. And9400:16:50.770 --> 00:17:06.279The Alliance: so like we had to do like enforced like affection. Time. Because we can go. We can miss each other for weeks on end. The problem is, you get none of the good social bonding neurochemistry that you actually get when you sleep next to somebody.9500:17:07.130 --> 00:17:13.615The Alliance: That's the right like you, you like you. The cost is too great in the relationship, right? It's all the invisible shit.9600:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.240James Crowe: Yeah.9700:17:14.579 --> 00:17:22.589The Alliance: And if you've got a if you're and it's safety, it feels like safety and security, which is right, that's the issue. So I hear you on that you get.9800:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.719James Crowe: Clear goals thing, you know, since we talked earlier.9900:17:26.499 --> 00:17:33.469The Alliance: Well, I get up at 5 30 already. I, you know, got my aura ring. I'm trying to sleep, you know.10000:17:33.987 --> 00:17:35.149James Crowe: But if you.10100:17:35.150 --> 00:17:41.230The Alliance: Going to bed at 9, you can get your 7 and a half hours. Well, I guess that's right. You got it. 5 30 is about right.10200:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.500James Crowe: And then10300:17:45.040 --> 00:17:53.529James Crowe: I did do like the clear goal thing. I said, well, yeah, I usually have about 18 or 20 on my today list. And you were like, how about 810400:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.490James Crowe: the last week? I've been just like 3, you know.10500:17:58.600 --> 00:18:07.169James Crowe: like, today, I've got like, Get response back to the lawyer and Usg 2 proofs. And10600:18:09.320 --> 00:18:21.960James Crowe: you know there's a travel thing I gotta do today, or it's all screwed up like, if it doesn't happen today. I got 3 things, even though I've been on zoom since. You know. 8 Am. I haven't had a time to do it. But I,10700:18:23.040 --> 00:18:30.190James Crowe: the clear goals, being less than 20 is what I'm saying. I I can see that being wise, and then I actually get10800:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.710James Crowe: get stuff done during the day instead of going home and say I didn't get anything done.10900:18:34.710 --> 00:18:52.790The Alliance: Yeah, you definitely, I mean, like, we're gonna get you through the crisis. And then you're gonna have to run like once it's semi gets back to normal, and you can run the clear goals, experiment and figure out how many, how many like, what should the right number be? You know what I mean, and I like I have to say I'm sort of digging this11000:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.920The Alliance: earlier to bed one, I think.11100:18:56.030 --> 00:19:09.236The Alliance: as you get used to the new bedtime and actually start falling, be able to fall asleep. You'll be able to. You'll be able to get up at 5 and get and get your sleep, so you'll get an extra half an hour sometime soon, I think, as you adjust.11200:19:10.230 --> 00:19:25.119The Alliance: I think that'll happen naturally. I and I think you know, setting clear goals the night before is probably a rocking thing for you, and I like how you're I like how you're thinking and the track. You don't have somebody who can do the travel thing for you.11300:19:29.060 --> 00:19:34.719James Crowe: well, some of it's personal with my wife, and my wife's not a planner, and I have to plan everything.11400:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.580James Crowe: Yeah.11500:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.030The Alliance: Do all like your assistant plan for you guys.11600:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.500James Crowe: Not. Personally, I can't do that, not in my university.11700:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.590James Crowe: She does a lot of my business travel. But11800:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.829James Crowe: I mean this, this is sort of a difficulty with my wife. She's I mean, you know. That's why I like her. She's like11900:19:55.020 --> 00:20:05.840James Crowe: Fuzzy and Open ended, and she's she's a writer, and you know, a not creative nonfiction writer goes in a million directions. I I know where I'm going to be 3 years, you know, from now at 10 am.12000:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.089James Crowe: And it's just sort of a cultural difference we have. And12100:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.599James Crowe: anyway, it's it's a minor thing. But12200:20:15.260 --> 00:20:23.009James Crowe: but I, you know, in the midst of all this I am. Maybe I'm being defensive. I'm trying to participate in the program, and I'm doing.12300:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.899James Crowe: You know as much of12400:20:25.300 --> 00:20:32.470James Crowe: this as I can. But I'm I'm realizing talking with you and Ryan like I've been sort of promiscuous and not12500:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.069James Crowe: not only doing it. You know what you're saying. I've been.12600:20:36.070 --> 00:20:45.429The Alliance: By the way, it's not everybody like this is the point that this is what. Why are you getting a lecture? Because this is everybody. This is everybody at this point in the program is like.12700:20:45.430 --> 00:21:08.660The Alliance: Oh, this is cool. It's been working. I got a little progress. And what else can I like. I want to freestyle. Everybody's freestyle, and I'm like, I'm like, look for 4 months. I was like, it's not that I don't want you to freestyle your creatives. But what I said is, try to make it your own rather than try to go that way, so we can all stay focused on the same thing and train together and get the synergy of the program.12800:21:08.910 --> 00:21:20.160The Alliance: But this is where everybody's at like, and I'm like I should have seen like, it's funny to me. I'm like, Oh, of course, like I, this is where I would start to lose focus like that right right about now. It's halfway about halfway.12900:21:20.470 --> 00:21:28.049James Crowe: Well, it's also like I mean you. You pick people who aren't going to be that compliant right.13000:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.770The Alliance: Oh, intentionally like, I'm not. You have to understand that. Like13100:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.349The Alliance: I just, I'm gonna be blunt because I want people to understand13200:21:41.750 --> 00:22:06.299The Alliance: the deals and relationships they're making with themselves around performance. I don't like I, you know, it strikes you that most of the people are having a lot of fun in the alliance. It's not like I think anybody is gonna like, Come out the other end and be like, oh, I had a bad time, and Steven, and it was bad. It was a shit broke. You know what I mean. I'm not really worried about all that, and everybody does seem to be making progress. I have to say, like you're in13300:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.939The Alliance: that most common like you were in a complicated situation to start with. And now13400:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.789The Alliance: I don't like you've got you do vaccines13500:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.739The Alliance: under trump, and your marriage is falling apart, I mean, like dude like just survive13600:22:26.360 --> 00:22:33.719The Alliance: Tuesday, you know, like like he's like I you know I got there's a but there's a the interesting thing is.13700:22:37.030 --> 00:22:43.899The Alliance: there is an ordering function here that you've. This tells you something so like this is kind of stuff I would put on my shit list, for example.13800:22:44.040 --> 00:22:51.929The Alliance: So you need to. Everybody needs to know. That's what this says. When push comes to shove. Everything's exploding in your life. You prioritized your wife.13900:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.779The Alliance: you said, wife. First, st14000:22:53.960 --> 00:23:09.519The Alliance: if even if I'm gonna fuck my bedtime up and go to bed, sit like that's huge. I know what that is. That's huge. So now, when you like, you know yourself, that's your filter like in terms of priority, right? So in making clear goals, list and all this stuff.14100:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.120The Alliance: you should crawl like the what moved the wife14200:23:13.250 --> 00:23:18.630The Alliance: higher up on the list in the day. Kind of thing, because that's actually where you're at with it. And14300:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.009The Alliance: there you go.14400:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.610The Alliance: Don't. It's gonna it weighs.14500:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.770James Crowe: Yeah.14600:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.780The Alliance: Right. And so that that and like.14700:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.099The Alliance: we gotta like like if in when I'm in your spot.14800:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.839The Alliance: the places I double down are the things that14900:23:33.960 --> 00:23:56.800The Alliance: automatically lighten cognitive load. So, gratitude less. If you've got 2Êmin between a task. 3 things I'm grateful for. You know what I mean like the breathing like you. Wanna like micro dose recovery as much as you possibly can. You can do the creative stuff. But like any of the meditate, any of this stuff, because I think you just got to keep15000:23:57.030 --> 00:23:57.790The Alliance: bum.15100:24:01.590 --> 00:24:13.149The Alliance: I could probably have the skills to like you could do a million things at once. So I have. I sort of like. If you could keep yourself calm enough, I think you can see your way through. It is my guess. Does that make sense to you.15200:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.070James Crowe: Yeah.15300:24:14.540 --> 00:24:21.040James Crowe: Well, one thing that I've stuck to, which takes time is my running. So15400:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.420James Crowe: I I get a lot out of that just sort of mentally. And so.15500:24:29.650 --> 00:24:39.050James Crowe: yeah, I mean, I was up early today and I went out his raining. And I'm I've stuck to the running because that's actually my physiologic reset. I feel a lot better.15600:24:39.050 --> 00:25:04.269The Alliance: Yeah, well, that's I mean, that's I. I think that's dope. And I also think there's something like when you can do something physically hard consistently through a crisis. That's the greatest training for the brain ever, I think like that's true like that's you know, and I and I and I agree with you like I have to keep skiing, no matter what right like I have to keep skiing otherwise. So I I love that for you. I think that's great.15700:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.930James Crowe: What are you doing this summer? Though? If you're skiing is your thing.15800:25:07.390 --> 00:25:19.809The Alliance: Well, I will ski. Usually. I'm so beat up by now that, like, I'm sort of just trying to like, get back get like get healthy again. But I'll ski through July.15900:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.770James Crowe: Okay.16000:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.240The Alliance: They closed mammoth yesterday.16100:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.400James Crowe: Oh, wow!16200:25:25.400 --> 00:25:33.370The Alliance: I didn't go cause I I quote. I'm you know I might. I'm finished. I'm on crazy deadlines.16300:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.150James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.16400:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.100The Alliance: Yeah.16500:25:35.100 --> 00:25:46.159James Crowe: Well, so you're periodizing a little bit. I mean, I kind of do that with running. I'll go up to a big race like I'm I'm theoretically doing a race running across Greece in September. Actually, I'm flying16600:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.900James Crowe: from your thing to Greece to run 155 mile race.16700:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.729James Crowe: So that's gonna be like super fit.16800:25:55.870 --> 00:26:01.490James Crowe: But then, like, for a few months after that, I'll jog with my wife for 3 or 4 miles, you know, in the morning, and like.16900:26:02.020 --> 00:26:26.339The Alliance: Yeah, I don't know I. So what I usually do is I just go into. I've been. I'm weight training really hard, right now. So what I'm really because I got the new acl, I'm trying to get my squats back up to 2, 25, and to get the depth in there. I I did 1 85 yesterday. I was at 1 85 yet this week, and my deadlifts17000:26:27.020 --> 00:26:51.519The Alliance: I like it to. I'd like to get my deadlifts. I my back to 2, 45, 2, 50, and my squats at 2, 25, and some others like. So I've got physical fitness goals. I'm going to go back to rock climbing because I put down the downhill mountain biking because I kept too much surgery. I just too much surgery. I love it fucking, love it but too much surgery, and I don't. And rock climbing there's like there's no you you17100:26:51.570 --> 00:26:57.090The Alliance: tweak your fingers sometimes, but that there's no surgery. Really, you gotta gotta be really stupid.17200:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.760James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.17300:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.040The Alliance: So that's the plan. And we'll see17400:27:05.300 --> 00:27:12.700The Alliance: how much like it depends on how much free time I have like late. I haven't like it's I'm still going at Marathon pace.17500:27:13.454 --> 00:27:18.840The Alliance: You know it's like 2 and a half years of Marathon pace, so like it'll slow sooner or later. But you know.17600:27:18.840 --> 00:27:25.110James Crowe: So I have like one last question for you about like you have your own business. I was thinking about today.17700:27:27.470 --> 00:27:43.839James Crowe: The intensity and pace and volume. I like to go. Not many people like that. Okay, so my family, my wife, suffers to be around that. But like also my team like there's almost nobody on my team that wants to live17800:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.920James Crowe: on the edge now, like during Covid.17900:27:47.340 --> 00:27:55.879James Crowe: It was a world emergency, and people fell in for like 6 months, and we did stuff that was completely impossible, and they loved it.18000:27:56.110 --> 00:28:01.479James Crowe: and they were up here 20ÊHA day. But it was sort of an extraordinary time that you can't recreate.18100:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.610James Crowe: And now18200:28:03.760 --> 00:28:12.859James Crowe: I'm not saying they're not awesome people and work super hard. I'm just saying cause problems because of the volume and intensity of my aspirations.18300:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.800James Crowe: and I sometimes I have trouble dealing with that I was like. Come on, come on, come on, and I don't want to be dissatisfied with them all the way all the time.18400:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.830The Alliance: All right, so.18500:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.659James Crowe: And you must experience that all again.18600:28:23.660 --> 00:28:34.679The Alliance: Dude. Yeah, I love talking to you because you have the same problems that I do a lot of times. It's fun talking to you so so let me let me go back to your wife for half a second, because I have to say this out loud.18700:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.560The Alliance: I have a very, very complicated18800:28:39.820 --> 00:28:56.870The Alliance: wife for the exact same reasons like you can't. She can't make plans because we've got 30 dogs. There's always going to be a dog emergency, and, like my schedule, is yours. I could tell you where I'm going to be on Tuesday, 4 years from now, right like with that. And I'm that I'm you and18900:28:57.550 --> 00:29:17.709The Alliance: etc, etc. I don't travel with her, which. But when we've traveled together it's the same thing I like that's like when you said it. I was like, Oh, I fucking been there! You can't use your assistant because it's too delicate, because your wife's too crazy. Sorry. My wife's too great like I've been there. I know this for all like all the sort of same like Hippie.19000:29:17.740 --> 00:29:28.540The Alliance: annoying fucking. Why don't you like? If you just earned a living for 2Êmin you would know this like, Shut the Oh, my God! So19100:29:31.300 --> 00:29:52.540The Alliance: the Kung Fu move on that one for me 2 things. What you have. It's it's it is literally unmanageable in the long haul. You can't do it. You have to renegotiate your contract with your wife around some of these things to lighten your load, especially during a trump crisis. But here's how I got19200:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.950The Alliance: so finally got my wife to understand.19300:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.430The Alliance: and it actually took the Frc. Wobbling19400:30:00.580 --> 00:30:30.389The Alliance: it like when it when like Frc. Wobble. And it was like, Oh, fuck! I gotta like. I gotta build a new company really pretty, fucking fast. And suddenly she realized that, like everything, she took for granted the Dream House, the dream dogs, like all of it, was actually threatened, and she started to understand that Steven's job one was her same job, like we're both in it to protect the bubble the little like right? And that's Job one. And once we19500:30:30.790 --> 00:30:41.920The Alliance: figured out like, we're okay. This is Job one, and you know, and she's doing it this way. And I'm doing it this way, because that's the primary. Now I can say, Hey, like19600:30:42.570 --> 00:31:03.079The Alliance: I'll give you an example. This is such a huge win in my marriage. You're gonna laugh really hard, but you totally get it so every day. Here's what happens. I start writing at 4. Am. I work? My cockadoodle guts out, leave everything on the page. Do 3 or 4 tasks, then go hike my dogs in the mountains, and then go in, and19700:31:03.330 --> 00:31:14.709The Alliance: I have to put food in my like there's no blood sugar. Yeah, I've been up for 5. I've done 4Êh, and I've just I exercise. I probably walked up a mountain with a 20 pound weight vest with my dogs, and19800:31:15.400 --> 00:31:24.389The Alliance: she will start talking to me a mile a minute, telling me all the things I like. She needs my attention on I have to do during the day, and I've got on.19900:31:24.460 --> 00:31:48.849The Alliance: I couldn't. I would. I would literally like, go into like a blind self, protective rage by the at the end of it when we were really not clicking. Finally, I've got to the point where I'm like. Don't have any blood sugar. You just have to wait for me to eat. Give me 10Êmin, 15Êmin, because right now I just like this is all a threat reaction. And so like I can cooperate with you. But I need 15Êmin20000:31:48.850 --> 00:31:58.680The Alliance: literally, and then I'll be a sane human being again. But I'm literally not sane. And you need a sane husband, and she finally like, that's the biggest win for me20100:31:58.680 --> 00:32:10.510The Alliance: like Oh, my God! Cause it would every day would tilt me, because every day I would have to like. Listen to a pile of shit with like exhausted and no blood sugar at the one like. It's the one weak spot in my day.20200:32:10.510 --> 00:32:22.580The Alliance: and but if I don't go into the house and see her, she's mad that we don't connect. I can't like, you know. I could eat breakfast over, you know, in my office. Sure I could. But20300:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.680The Alliance: then I right then I don't connect my wife, and that's the problem so like.20400:32:27.810 --> 00:32:49.729The Alliance: but I literally 22 years to fucking, solve that particular one. So my point is like, find a set, a common center that you can renegotiate from a little bit. Maybe it'll help, and that's 1. Let's talk about your second one, which is another sorry, taking a little extra time. But this is such a? These were great questions. First, st the wife thing intrigued me and the20500:32:50.950 --> 00:32:55.410The Alliance: team thing we used to say at the Flow Research collective.20600:32:57.270 --> 00:33:07.330The Alliance: this job we tell people this job is not, for everyone like Steven, moves at a speed that most people like cannot keep pace with, and Rian does as well.20700:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.630James Crowe: Though.20800:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.710The Alliance: What I found is at scale.20900:33:16.220 --> 00:33:44.299The Alliance: You actually can't do it at all. I don't know how to do it at all. You can't build a company that is tight enough of a players who manage themselves and can move at the speed that we move. At. This, stated I. I don't. But what you, what I've found you can do is you can find I have a there's a couple of key positions, for example, Chase, who you met days can move at speed. Days can really move at speed. Ryan21000:33:45.160 --> 00:34:07.889The Alliance: can't move at speed, but he's very. He's a lot. I got him over 3 years. I got him like twice as fast. I would like to double him again. But he's really good now. So I'm like, Okay, he's really. I've got him good, and he's moving fast enough that I'm not. I'm not going behind so.21100:34:08.040 --> 00:34:36.729The Alliance: and a couple of the people what like our content team is hyper fast because I need. They have to be hyper fast. So I've found. One thing I've done is I've realized you can't do it with a big organization. So I've shrunk was one of the reasons I shrunk 2. I've identified the positions that are deal breakers for me. Where do which things actually have to move at speed to do this stuff, and then I've parcelated some of the tasks21200:34:36.989 --> 00:34:55.349The Alliance: do, cause I know Ryan can't quite move at speed, but I can give him one or 2 tasks to move at speed on, and everything else is, gonna and my chief science officer is the same. He can handle one at speed project. Everything else is gonna be like academic speed, right? And I'm gonna have to nudge him all the fucking time.21300:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.040James Crowe: My life.21400:34:56.300 --> 00:35:21.910The Alliance: Oh, my God! Academic speed is the worst ever like it's I would say, the speed of like entrepreneurship. Business is at half the pace of entrepreneurship, and then academia is like a quarter of the pace of business. Maybe maybe so like I feel for you, Bro, because these people don't like I can't do it. I literally can't like I don't know how to do it. That's why I'm not in Academia at all.21500:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.950The Alliance: Yeah, because I just think it's too glacial. I can't do it. And they and they think too small.21600:35:27.070 --> 00:35:33.939The Alliance: I'm writing a fucking paper. The title of the new paper is hard problem, what hard problem? And it's21700:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.310The Alliance: literally a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. But, like.21800:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.860The Alliance: you know, you can't really do that from totally inside you like that's a sort of an outsider, you know.21900:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.300James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.22000:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.070The Alliance: Lunch, but up, I think, with a team22100:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.970The Alliance: I have had to. I I have had to figure out one.22200:35:55.300 --> 00:36:03.979The Alliance: They don't move at my speed. What I can do is I can teach them all the high performance things that I use to move at my speed. Because.22300:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.210The Alliance: let me ask you a question.22400:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.969The Alliance: I don't know if this was your experience, but22500:36:10.370 --> 00:36:27.229The Alliance: I think it was because it was mine. I was 30 years old, and I remember saying to myself, Oh, my God, I'm moving so fucking fast! I'm gonna die. I've never moved this fast. I've never worked hard. Oh, my God, I can't go any faster. I can't do any more. Whoa! I'm totally maxed, and 6 months later22600:36:27.230 --> 00:36:45.080The Alliance: I got more efficient. I got better. I got smarter on the performance I was moving. It's like, Wow, I'm moving twice as fast. Holy shit! I can't move any faster. Blah blah! And what I noticed is like over like 3 years where each time it would happen, and I would have this panic attack like, Oh, my God! I can't move this fast!22700:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.500The Alliance: I would look back, and I'd realize that like, oh, no, wait! I like22800:36:49.650 --> 00:37:00.009The Alliance: can move this fast like I can rise. I keep. I kept looking for some upper limit right, and the only time I discovered there was an upper limit was22900:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.800The Alliance: when there was either extreme economic hardship or my wife got involved.23000:37:07.090 --> 00:37:12.060The Alliance: Then there's an upper limit, because those 2 things are so taxing to my nervous system.23100:37:12.250 --> 00:37:22.722The Alliance: can't. I can't fly at speed anymore. So other than those 2 things. I like I'm I'm I'm fine at speed. I can move at speed.23200:37:23.260 --> 00:37:29.149The Alliance: But it took a while is my point. It took me a while, so I think with. With people23300:37:29.260 --> 00:37:50.750The Alliance: you can hire a handful of people in key positions who have figured it out on their own can move at that speed. Now, how to hire for speed. That's a really interesting fucking question. I'll tell you what I did, how I got re end, and I'll tell you how I did it. That's a totally separate one. But I think you you 1st you identify the positions you have to have speed. Otherwise you're really fucked up.23400:37:51.130 --> 00:38:18.950The Alliance: and that's what you still aim for, that for starters and figure out actually where you don't actually need like. Sometimes you don't need to move at speed in all the places you're moving at speed and slower is actually sometimes better. So if I like, identify, like, I parsulate it out that way right? Who's the key positions where they have to move at speed? Blah! Blah! And then like that sort of stuff. And then what you have to do with the people who are great, but they're not fast enough. And you want to keep.23500:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.459The Alliance: They literally have to get23600:38:21.620 --> 00:38:27.049The Alliance: low training and peak performance training. Because that's actually how you learn to move at speed right.23700:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.830James Crowe: You have to. The problem is, you can't.23800:38:29.940 --> 00:38:37.380The Alliance: Mission them into speed. They don't have the confidence to move at speed. They they 1st of all, if they have the commitment.23900:38:37.980 --> 00:38:56.259The Alliance: they don't have the confidence, and if they don't, they probably don't have the confidence. Most people those 2 things move in lockstep when you you can do more. You're like, oh, wow! Look what I just did! What else could I do? What else can I do? What else can I do? That's how we become us right. It's not that we started out24000:38:56.400 --> 00:39:09.230The Alliance: taking on this shit. It's that we learned it slowly over time, and we both have that same instinct where you're like. Oh, shit! Look what I just learned! Look what I just did! What what else? What's next? What do you? What else you got? What's harder right24100:39:09.580 --> 00:39:18.039The Alliance: like. That's the instinct. And if you're not wired, or if you're not that hungry, and you don't right, have the really big visions.24200:39:18.240 --> 00:39:26.370The Alliance: It's hard to. So you've got to sort of find find that, and hire for that. The thing I did with Rian that you could do very easily in your position is24300:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.609The Alliance: I who's looking for an intern. And I needed. It's so hard to onboard a goddamn intern24400:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.439The Alliance: and train them that I was like, I can't fuck around anymore. I'm gonna give them a Phd.24500:39:39.770 --> 00:40:04.749The Alliance: And 2 months to do it. And I'm going to see what happens. I know they're going to fail. Let's see how far they get. Let's see how they fail. This. So the Ph. The fucking question was, I need the entire history of intuition from pre-socratic to now, including the moral philosophers, the economic, like all of it, I need it mapped out. I need connected tissue and blah blah all this stuff, and I gave it to Rian.24600:40:04.990 --> 00:40:09.570The Alliance: This was before there was AI, right. This is like, there's Google, but there's not AI.24700:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.080James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.24800:40:10.080 --> 00:40:16.340The Alliance: I, and I like I gave it 1020 people nobody could. I mean. Nobody even got close24900:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.150The Alliance: reinfinished it.25000:40:19.840 --> 00:40:48.769The Alliance: I gave him a task that I thought everybody was gonna fail on mail, and he finished it, and I still have it. It's a damn good map. I'm using it to help me write the book on intuition that I'm starting next month like he. So I created an impossible challenge and he solved it. And that's how I filtered for it on the front end. Found people, you know, and I started with younger people who were super passionate to work with me because they're not. I gotta train them. Anyways. Ryan doesn't know any other speed.25100:40:48.830 --> 00:41:12.370The Alliance: because he came out of fucking college onto my like. He had done the internship he had worked with a bunch of people, but he literally came out of college onto my fucking team. He just thought this was the speed. And if you're 23 years old, and somebody's giving. You know what I mean. Like you don't know any better, because that's how fast life moves at 23, anyways, like you're fine. You don't realize that like nobody.25200:41:12.570 --> 00:41:17.279The Alliance: right? So I I convinced him this was normal. That's how I did that with that.25300:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.370James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.25400:41:19.670 --> 00:41:20.270The Alliance: But.25500:41:20.530 --> 00:41:26.660James Crowe: Yeah, internally, when you're when you're in a situation where everybody around you is not there like.25600:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.590The Alliance: Okay, so here's yeah. So yeah.25700:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.320The Alliance: so yeah, let me. So a couple other things25800:41:31.740 --> 00:41:36.500The Alliance: I need to know, I. So what I manage for.25900:41:36.710 --> 00:41:54.660The Alliance: so that my, this is my friend Anthony, who told me this. Anthony runs, if you need to put on a super bowl halftime show beyonce you call Anthony. He's the guy you want to put on it. You want to. You want to do live aid for 250,000 people, and you need somebody to build the show and put it together. He's the guy. There's only like26000:41:54.700 --> 00:42:08.399The Alliance: 7 of them in the world, right like he did U two's tours shit like that and working with is amazing because he thinks of the scale that, like, I don't think like, I don't know anybody who thinks of the scale of the Peter D. Bandis like period. Anyways.26100:42:08.520 --> 00:42:29.249The Alliance: he said, there's 2 when you're doing these big herculean things. There are 2 kinds of people in the world. There's people you manage through, and there's people you manage around. He's like the people when you can't fire them, and they have weak spots. You have to know what their weak spots are, and manage around their weak spots because you can't fix them. You don't have time. You're moving too fast.26200:42:29.250 --> 00:42:42.909The Alliance: If you try to fix their weak spots. This was. This is my issue with Ryan. You can fix his weak spots, but it's gonna take years, because that's how long it took us to learn that shit. So don't expect them to learn shit faster than you26300:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.180The Alliance: learned. You're already a key, mind, you can't expect that? That's not.26400:42:47.200 --> 00:43:15.019The Alliance: It's not gonna happen. That's a fairy tale. So some people you have to manage around while they come up slowly, in which case, like I looked at. Oh, where's Ryan? Super slow, like we met. I made him. I made him time code everything he did in a month it was really clear. We looked at the time code, and I was like, Oh, you spend the majority of your time editing content. Of course you do. You're not an editor. This is stupid, right? I can make you 18 times faster if I hire a good editor26500:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.700The Alliance: problem solved.26600:43:16.980 --> 00:43:35.610The Alliance: So that's that, and that. That's sort of how I look at that sort of stuff I manage around their slowdowns as much as I can and I try to do with this transparency and buy it. And like, Hey, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do this. I want you to focus here. But I also need to get faster here.26700:43:36.946 --> 00:43:38.180The Alliance: In exchange.26800:43:38.623 --> 00:43:43.789The Alliance: I do a lot of. I do a lot of those sorts of things because you can't.26900:43:44.030 --> 00:44:01.589The Alliance: You can't ask people to change personality traits that quickly be also because they need confidence, like people won't change without a reason. Right? They need a reason to change. And if they're making over $75,000 a year or $800,000 a year. It's not going to be financial.27000:44:01.640 --> 00:44:15.070The Alliance: They need mastery. That's the that's the best motivator. Mastery is the best motivator. So they need those little wins and they go faster and faster and faster. But they you gotta. You gotta arm them with the tools, them tools you're arming yourself with.27100:44:15.250 --> 00:44:22.970The Alliance: They have to be armed with all sorts of, and you know, and you get what you incentivize.27200:44:23.160 --> 00:44:38.969The Alliance: Right? You know this, you get what you incentivize. So if you're incentivized. But we incentivize and speed the flow research collective, holy shit. Did we break shit? We had to de-incentivize that because it started to get like, like, because people couldn't27300:44:40.140 --> 00:44:51.020The Alliance: do the work at that speed. So they were breaking shit right like I was asking too much. The and the other thing is in big organizations like, what ends up happening is you just push people till you break them27400:44:51.260 --> 00:45:09.950The Alliance: and get. I mean? That's the big text response. Right? Push people to your break them, get rid of them, push people to break and get rid of them, burn talent out, burn talent out. I find that in the long run that's like it's too hard to train people. It's hard to find. Hiring and training is too hard, and I hate it. So27500:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.540The Alliance: do they need that help.27600:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.070James Crowe: Yeah, yeah, I haven't.27700:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.239James Crowe: These are all good ideas. I have27800:45:19.430 --> 00:45:25.390James Crowe: thought system. I think, about just what I want to do. And we hire the best people we can, but I haven't thought about27900:45:27.214 --> 00:45:32.449James Crowe: individuals and the components of their jobs, and which parts are fast and slow.28000:45:32.450 --> 00:45:41.759The Alliance: Oh, yeah, it's have them keep a catalog of like, of how much what they do over 2 weeks, and how much time they spend on each thing28100:45:42.467 --> 00:46:10.529The Alliance: and have you gotta. You gotta build a calendar for everybody, and they just fill it in and do it with your core team. You're gonna be amazed at what you learn, because one you sometimes have people doing the wrong shit. We're like, you know, when we did this, I'm like, wait a minute. What the fuck are you doing like my like this is? She's good at this. What are you doing? You know what I mean like that sort of stuff where you just like, get the inefficiencies out of the system by making shit visible and.28200:46:11.380 --> 00:46:19.889James Crowe: There must be a correlation, too, between. If someone takes a really long time on it. They probably don't like it either, which is weird, because then they're spending.28300:46:21.580 --> 00:46:22.589James Crowe: you know, like.28400:46:22.650 --> 00:46:26.999The Alliance: Or well, but you. So it depends. Because, like.28500:46:27.470 --> 00:46:35.659The Alliance: for example, if you're trying to do anything with deep thinking right, the best way to learn something is a little bit today, a little bit tomorrow.28600:46:35.990 --> 00:46:59.759The Alliance: live with the next day, take a break, come back in a week like there's very specific periodic patterns to how do we best learn? Especially around like are things we're trying to skill up expertise which require big incubation periods. But in between baked in. So like sometimes, if you're trying to level up, that's just actually how long it takes.28700:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.508James Crowe: Well, I'm just thinking of28800:47:05.410 --> 00:47:13.510James Crowe: It's kind of like Peter principle, like people don't like things that they're not good at. And then they get in this sort of vortex of28900:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.520James Crowe: if you're trying to push them to improve this thing that they don't like, and they're not good at sort of like.29000:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.170The Alliance: Yeah. No.29100:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.300James Crowe: Get away from everything.29200:47:21.300 --> 00:47:28.399The Alliance: Yeah. And I mean, so the easiest. We do this all the time. So like, if you're trying to generate flow in a company.29300:47:28.810 --> 00:47:39.270The Alliance: right. Figure out what? What like, where you're what like, what lies between strengths and purpose, like which flow triggers sit between strengths and purpose.29400:47:39.330 --> 00:47:51.979The Alliance: If you get people to use 3 or 4 of their strengths. The reason we do all that invisible skill stuff and look at your invisible skills when you work at the intersection of 3 or 4 strengths and skills29500:47:51.980 --> 00:48:16.950The Alliance: you get it maximizes flow like it all. It's a flow trigger maximizes flow. So what I try to do is create a situation where people are working at the intersection of 3 or 4 strengths and one weakness. They're training up one weakness at a time, but they're giddy flowy from the 3 or 4 strengths. So the their learning is amped up right. But I always try. That was the problem with like my29600:48:16.950 --> 00:48:36.040The Alliance: my team is, I'll overburden them right? That that's why I'm having a map of who's good at what and where and how that allows me to sort of like, and what people's strengths are that allows me to code for that kind of stuff. Now, I I think I've got a like if I can. I've got 5 people who work for me. Now you know what I mean.29700:48:36.040 --> 00:48:36.359James Crowe: You know.29800:48:36.360 --> 00:48:46.840The Alliance: Possible to do when I had 100. I don't like I don't know how you do. You know what I mean like? Maybe if I had like a best friend who is my Hr partner, but like, you know.29900:48:47.200 --> 00:48:47.650The Alliance: yeah.30000:48:47.650 --> 00:48:49.350James Crowe: Like that's not a reality.30100:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.610James Crowe: 50. We have about 50. So it's30200:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.585James Crowe: but I have a few closer to me that I depend on more. And30300:48:57.170 --> 00:49:02.769James Crowe: we've done some testing. You know, we did like strength finders and things like that.30400:49:02.770 --> 00:49:20.292The Alliance: Guys, I think that stuff is shit. That's why I always tell people, what are your invisible skills? Because, like points out this obvious stuff, you know that like it's not. You don't learn anything from that stuff, right? It's just sort of like, oh, God! That's why I'm always like, what are your invisible skills. And30500:49:21.130 --> 00:49:33.710The Alliance: the example that I always give is Shane Mcconkey. Shane was one of the greatest skiers in history, and it wasn't that he was a better athlete. He was an amazing athlete.30600:49:33.770 --> 00:50:03.070The Alliance: but there were better athletes all over the place. It's that Shane could look at a mountain and see a line down the mountain that nobody else could see. He literally could go. Oh, wow! If I jump off that click, I can land on that patch of snow cut left bounce over here 40 feet drop that shoot sideway like, and everybody else is like. No, no, that's death like he literally would see lines where everybody else saw death, and then he would go and ski those lines which was30700:50:03.130 --> 00:50:12.869The Alliance: in like nobody could do that. But like when I remember asking if a journalist was like, what makes Shane so special like. I've seen him ski like he does. Amazing shit. But he doesn't look30800:50:13.240 --> 00:50:32.099The Alliance: right like I got a hundred other skiers who I'm like. They're better, and everybody's like, no, no, Shane's better, and I'm like I what and like it was like you're not seeing what he's actually doing, which is the thing that nobody else can do, which is, you can see a line down the mountain, and nobody else can even imagine as possible. So they don't see it. It's invisible.30900:50:32.530 --> 00:50:45.590The Alliance: and Shane can see it. And that was where it came from. Invisible skills. I was like, oh, that's what you're looking for in yourself. And one of the things that's interesting about invisible skills I found with people is like.31000:50:46.000 --> 00:51:09.620The Alliance: you can ask your friends. You know you can all do that stuff. But it it's a cool challenge to figure out what are your invisible skills. And how do I find a way to work at a couple like I'm really good at talking to anybody. And I'm actually really good at puzzle solving for other people right? And problem solving for other people. Thus the alliance like that's a really good example of that like I would have never thought, oh, I should go create a mastermind.31100:51:09.680 --> 00:51:18.370The Alliance: It's just a weird thing for me to want to do. But if you look at a bunch of my invisible skills no, no, it actually makes a ton of fucking sense31200:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.214The Alliance: like more than the other training stuff.31300:51:23.010 --> 00:51:23.640James Crowe: Yeah.31400:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.440The Alliance: Does that make any sense.31500:51:26.690 --> 00:51:30.410James Crowe: Yeah, yeah, I need to rethink my my people.31600:51:30.650 --> 00:51:38.240James Crowe: That helps. So yeah, turn it around from wanting to kill them to what are their strengths and31700:51:38.950 --> 00:51:46.800James Crowe: not pushing on a bunch of weaknesses all at once, which, you know speed is one of my things, but it's not everybody's31800:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.860James Crowe: highest thing, so I might be pushing.31900:51:49.860 --> 00:52:05.279The Alliance: No, and I mean like, and the and the truth of the matter is like you, you actually don't. Speed is not what you care about speed is the adjective we put on it. Whether the verb we put on what you actually care about is ask completion.32000:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.010James Crowe: Yeah.32100:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.400The Alliance: All that you care about is task completion. It's excellent.32200:52:08.400 --> 00:52:08.999James Crowe: It is a.32300:52:09.330 --> 00:52:10.830The Alliance: It's execution.32400:52:10.830 --> 00:52:24.630James Crowe: Yeah, there was another one of these per personality systems called working genius, that a guy Vanderbilt wrote, and everybody got a copy of the book and we took it. The book is absolutely terrible, but the there's like 6 working, and it's in sequence.32500:52:24.740 --> 00:52:32.449James Crowe: And the beginning is it's like at the beginning. You wonder like you wonder? Why can't it be 10 x. Like, what? Why not?32600:52:32.900 --> 00:52:47.419James Crowe: And then you have people who invent the solution to make the 10 x happen. And then you have people that recruit in the team, and they're sort of more touchy, feely. But one of the the 6th one is finishing stuff a hundred percent like finishing, closing the loop.32700:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.229James Crowe: And when we did this thing32800:52:49.480 --> 00:53:05.259James Crowe: it's weird, because I'm wonder. I'm like, super high on wonder. But I also am super high on finishing. And I'm the only guy on the team that's a finisher. And so people will get 92% there. And I'm like, Come on, come on! Come on! We got to finish this until we hit the button. We're not done.32900:53:05.570 --> 00:53:15.170The Alliance: Oh, no. So yeah, here's the you have to have another. You have to have 2 finishers on a team. You can't. I don't believe you can do it with one.33000:53:15.410 --> 00:53:25.439The Alliance: I've always chased me or the finishers. Now it used to be ran, and me like you have to have 2 on a team because you have to have the guy who's shouting from the front, and then you have to have33100:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.050The Alliance: empty asshole.33200:53:27.400 --> 00:53:34.900The Alliance: and you can't be the ad. You can't be the visionary leader and the asshole at the same time. Somebody else has to be the asshole. That's why you have.33300:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.679James Crowe: That might be it. I mean, that's part of the deal like33400:53:38.170 --> 00:53:44.964James Crowe: I'm taking us to a really wonderful place, and I pull people along, and they're excited. But then I'm like, why didn't you.33500:53:45.260 --> 00:53:59.629The Alliance: Yeah, you can't. You actually have to find somebody who's your like. You need a project manager who can move as fast as you and has iron balls and hates it. When people don't like. You know what I mean.33600:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.990James Crowe: Yeah, yeah.33700:53:59.990 --> 00:54:05.800The Alliance: They take it as a moral sin against God when you don't meet a deadline. That's who you want, right.33800:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.020James Crowe: Yeah, yeah, yeah.33900:54:07.250 --> 00:54:16.289James Crowe: we got closest. I have 6 project managers that work for me. But then I keep talking about this problem. And basically, we came to the idea of a chief of staff34000:54:16.500 --> 00:54:26.200James Crowe: who would just basically be my buddy, you know, and know the way, I think. And then say, Jim's gonna be pissed if you don't finish this and just go like 2 days ahead of me34100:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.280James Crowe: putting out the stuff. And then I was.34200:54:28.280 --> 00:54:34.120The Alliance: That's exactly what I mean. That's what a chief of staff does. They make sure that when you show up it's smooth as shit.34300:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.520James Crowe: Yeah, all right.34400:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.320The Alliance: Probably need.34500:54:37.320 --> 00:54:37.880James Crowe: Confirm.34600:54:37.880 --> 00:54:55.050The Alliance: Those are hard. Those are a little hard to find, but if you could find the right one, cause like the what I would tell you is, if what I would tell you is, be cautious there because you can't find like you've got 6 Project managers. You should be able to look at one of them and be like, Oh, I promote you, and if you can't.34700:54:55.310 --> 00:55:01.960The Alliance: if you can't look at your existing project, managers, and find the person you would promote to Chief of Staff. You're probably hiring wrong.34800:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.740James Crowe: Yeah, it's complicated.34900:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.780James Crowe: But.35000:55:13.060 --> 00:55:18.760The Alliance: I believe you, and I'm not saying like you could fix it because it there might be a lot of stuff that you can't touch. There.35100:55:19.140 --> 00:55:33.290James Crowe: Well, so the person who runs all the project managers. One of the things that with my executive coach is sort of like I don't like rounding, and I don't like just chatting with people. Hey? How's your day? How was your weekend like that? Is not me, I mean like, did you get the thing done.35200:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.810The Alliance: Yeah.35300:55:33.810 --> 00:55:34.520James Crowe: That's really exciting.35400:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.090The Alliance: Yeah, yeah.35500:55:35.090 --> 00:55:45.539James Crowe: The data is exciting. Now I'm engaged with you. Let's go on. I want to talk about your weekend, but sometimes you got to take care of people. So the the chief, the head of this 635600:55:45.740 --> 00:55:50.060James Crowe: 6 project manager, she's a portfolio manager. She takes care of people, and then.35700:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.019James Crowe: when they're getting stressed. I talk with her so35800:55:53.340 --> 00:55:59.699James Crowe: his idea was, I need somebody to do that on my behalf, because I just don't have that in me, and I don't. I'm not good at.35900:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.359James Crowe: So that's why I'm saying like being just like me to be over. Everybody.36000:56:04.910 --> 00:56:09.920The Alliance: Alright. So let me tell you, I'm gonna give you it. I'm gonna give you the Steven Kung Fu36100:56:10.040 --> 00:56:23.109The Alliance: because nobody hates chit chat more than me like you can't like. I don't do it at all, and I get really pissy, if you're like, you know, and it's bad for flow. So36200:56:24.150 --> 00:56:51.790The Alliance: what I and this is developed after years of working with the same editor who's like, we're both prickly and overworked, and by the time we get together we have to do really intense work together. The most intense work I do is with him, and he has to read aloud, which is maybe the most tiring thing you could possibly have to do, and he's got to think about what he's reading while he's doing it, so he can write. He's got a really hard job. It's gotta work. And36300:56:51.980 --> 00:57:19.589The Alliance: he he was super temperamental. You know what I mean like, and you could have a snit and get pissed and disappear for 2 weeks, and my fucking editor is gone, and now everything stalled right like. So for years I was like, how do I manage this Guy until I can get him to see the value of always keeping his like. I've got it where I took forever, and what actually one of the things that changed it was. It was Annie Lala does this different similar thing in marriage counseling.36400:57:19.590 --> 00:57:23.440The Alliance: and I found it's really great in business stuff. I would go in, and I'd be like.36500:57:23.950 --> 00:57:47.210The Alliance: Hey, you know, I'm bad at the emotional stuff and asking about your cat and your weekend and everything else. But I wanna, I wanna be able to get the level right for this conversation. So scale of one to 10 where you at emotionally, and if it's anywhere below 6 like, Hey, below 6 is a little. Is there anything you wanna you wanna tell me that's gonna impact your work.36600:57:48.790 --> 00:58:17.940The Alliance: Once a blue moon, somebody will tell me something, but as a general rule they're so fucking fired up that I asked, and not about them. I'm trying to calibrate where you are. So how so? So we can communicate most effectively. I'm in service of the thing, and I'm openly falling on my sword, hey? You know I'm bad at the emotional stuff. I'm on 16 of the spectrums. And but I you know, I need to check in on that level because it could get in the way of our collaboration. So you know.36700:58:18.190 --> 00:58:43.169The Alliance: do you have a good weekend? You cool everything, you know. Scale of one to 10 where you at kind of thing, and people fucking love it, and they don't waste my time with the emotional stuff, because they know I'm I'm openly admitting that I'm bad at it at the front end of it, and and after like, I still do it with Michael. I'm not. I'll be like, Hey, you know all the things scale of one to 10. Where are you today?36800:58:43.170 --> 00:58:55.499The Alliance: Right? That then that's how we start most of our meetings these days. Cause, I just need to know. Are there emotions gonna get in the way of our decision making? Because if they are, you know what I mean. I wanna know36900:58:55.580 --> 00:59:13.383The Alliance: I don't want you to fake. Oh, I'm sick! Oh, I'm fighting my wife! Oh, I like I'm not gonna fix your fucking marriage. I can't do that. That's not my job. And I'm not the guy to fix your marriage anyways, like meet Annie right. She's the she'll fix your marriage. I can't fix your marriage. Annie will fix your marriage. But37000:59:15.010 --> 00:59:19.310The Alliance: if it's gonna get in the way of us moving at the speed I need us to move at, and especially because.37100:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.969James Crowe: So say again the the one to 10 phrase.37200:59:21.970 --> 00:59:49.069The Alliance: But literally saying, Hey, I'm hey, you know I'm bad at all the emotional stuff. But I really want this to be sort of. You know the the best conversation we could have, the you know best collaboration I can have. And so, you know, I thought I should ask, you know, and I do it. Funny, I'm like, you know, how was your weekend? Is your cat healthy? Is your mom? Okay scale of one to 10 emotionally? Where are you at? So I can calibrate accordingly.37300:59:49.580 --> 00:59:55.110The Alliance: Scale of one to 10 emotionally. Where are you at? So I can calibrate accordingly, is what I say.37400:59:55.750 --> 01:00:01.530The Alliance: but I'm playful with it. I'm always smiling a little and like laughing so they know. But37501:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.560James Crowe: Yeah, I like that a lot.37601:00:05.560 --> 01:00:16.370The Alliance: It is amazing what happens if you just give people permission. Most. The problem with most of us is that there's 2 kinds of people in the world.37701:00:16.650 --> 01:00:23.090The Alliance: You and I are the 1st kind. I believe this is the second kind. There's a group of people who believe that37801:00:23.370 --> 01:00:29.540The Alliance: they figure out very early on that. If you let life be your excuse.37901:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.200The Alliance: life will always be your excuse38001:00:32.970 --> 01:00:57.429The Alliance: right if you let life be your excuse for not doing like. It's because life is always going to keep punching you in the mouth. It doesn't ever stop punching in the mouth. But if you let those, if you, the people who survive and thrive are the people who go. Oh, I can take the pain, or whatever you got bitch, and I could turn it into work, because work is my salvation, right? And I like. That's how you win. This is the only way, like there's no other way to win, and you ultimately have to realize that.38101:00:57.430 --> 01:01:08.089The Alliance: Oh, my emotions are very volatile, but they change all the fucking time, so they don't act. It doesn't matter how it feels what matters is just that I execute. But you can't ask. People38201:01:08.480 --> 01:01:33.849The Alliance: don't play that way. Play that way. They, fucking hate you for it right? It's not, they don't. They will get there on their own when they get the excitement of like you. Once they start goals like achieving goals. That's what gets you there, but you can't get there without, like the fire that you get from dopamine and goals. So that's a slower burn for most people. Most people.38301:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.070The Alliance: Life is going to get in the way.38401:01:36.210 --> 01:02:05.470The Alliance: And so what they need, because life has gotten in the way like every like you assume, I assume, like on my team. Jason Kelsey are unblocked by life, and Kai Ryan, on the other hand, has a wife and 3 kids, and like he gets lifed a lot in ways that he can't see coming, and he really prioritizes marriage. And I support that so like like he gets lifed a lot with Ryan. I need to38501:02:05.670 --> 01:02:10.449The Alliance: manage for the I need to give him the space to, hey? I got lifed38601:02:10.560 --> 01:02:23.820The Alliance: and just acknowledge it, and then he can focus and get to work. So like it is I have to like, hey? One to 10. How crazy, how how crazy is the kid explosion today? And he'll be like, Oh, Kai's sick!38701:02:24.590 --> 01:02:33.550The Alliance: Give me got into fighting the homeroom, and Angela's flipping out because Microsoft needs blah blah. And I'm like, Oh, that sounds heavy. He's like, yeah, but I can work through it. Let's go.38801:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.390James Crowe: Like.38901:02:34.390 --> 01:02:51.020The Alliance: He, they just want this. They just want you to notice that there's a human being there who's going through some stuff, and it's hard for them. You know what I mean. And the other thing is the thing you have to realize that. And this is what's so great about doing it. The power that you get is so39001:02:51.890 --> 01:03:06.500The Alliance: I learned this from working with art. Anytime you work with creatives, creatives literally will not hear anything more than the 3rd task you give them. Scientists are a little bit this way, too, because when you have a really creative scientific mind, somebody gives you, hey? There's39101:03:06.650 --> 01:03:23.420The Alliance: and things to do. I'm gonna walk you through them. Your brain starts puzzle solving as soon as you hear up one like you're not listening fully now you're puzzle solving, especially if you take it personally. 2. And by the time you get to 3 you're totally overloaded. You literally nobody hears 7 through 10.39201:03:23.420 --> 01:03:23.760James Crowe: Yeah.39301:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.530The Alliance: And I started to realize that if they had emotional shit going on in their life they would only hear one.39401:03:28.680 --> 01:03:47.350The Alliance: and they wouldn't hear anything else on the list. So I was like, I gotta. How do I solve for this? And I was like, Oh, by letting them be their human artist self for 2Êmin the front end of the conversation, because it's actually gonna clear some space and open up some cognitive load. And if they tell me they're totally overloaded. I know.39501:03:47.490 --> 01:04:09.729The Alliance: Okay, I gotta like, lay out a couple of things and then be like, Hey, I'm gonna do those things. And then I'm gonna send you a task list of everything else. Focus on those things. Do you have any questions? And I line them up for like, oh, they're overloaded. So what are the 2 things that have to get done immediately, and then that don't overload them? I intentionally underload them so they can have the easy win.39601:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.920The Alliance: And come back to me for the next thing.39701:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.969The Alliance: Does that make sense.39801:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.159James Crowe: Yeah, yeah, I love this. This feels like.39901:04:16.160 --> 01:04:24.405The Alliance: Yeah, I made. I like, so this is this is how I manage for speed like you asked that question. This is how I manage for speed. I40001:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.050The Alliance: And I find a40101:04:28.530 --> 01:04:33.489The Alliance: I don't want them to feel like I'm managing for speed. I want them to feel like I'm managing for a a40201:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.304The Alliance: something that they could. They they sort of can believe in40301:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.910The Alliance: And so, like, you know, you gamify it.40401:04:44.060 --> 01:04:50.799The Alliance: Okay, these are the. This is the impossible goals. This is the like. How many points do we get for each completion40501:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.011The Alliance: like that sort of stuff?40601:04:54.830 --> 01:04:59.149The Alliance: starts to start to work, but you got to give them some of the peak performance tools like40701:04:59.610 --> 01:05:27.279The Alliance: load them up with clear goals and a recovery practice like start there could make sure they're like, Hey, your emotional stuff really matters. And we have to be on points. These are the 5 different, you know, ways to reset your nervous system every day. If you're going to work in in for me, I love it. If you could do one right. Gratitude, practice 10Êmin of breathing above breath. Work 15Êmin reading fiction. 20Êmin. Walk in the woods more than 20Êmin. Go go work out.40801:05:29.410 --> 01:05:53.510The Alliance: or Yoga's. Yoga's good, you know what I mean, and there's a lot of like there's a lot of middle ones. But like, just start people with a recovery practice right? And and then, like one float just like the clear goals, because that's always most people don't actually like they know they should make clear goals lists. But most people think the psychological tools are so flimsy.40901:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.449The Alliance: Why bother like, what's the? And and the problem is that the41001:06:00.240 --> 01:06:26.600The Alliance: tolerances like you got a 5 degree window between challenge and skills when we're at our fucking best and allostatic load stress over time shrinks the window. So by the time you get to our age, how big do you think that window is? And now, how big do you think it is for your staff that when their challenge, because windows probably like 2 degrees wide. If there is overloaded and stressed about like as you are, you know what I mean, like.41101:06:27.360 --> 01:06:34.929The Alliance: you're gonna be fine, whatever happens with trump. They know that they, on the other hand, are gonna lose jobs that are going to be very hard to replace.41201:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.419The Alliance: Right? Like.41301:06:39.430 --> 01:06:48.539James Crowe: Yeah, there's a lot of stress in my group. In fact, we're riffing some people. And then I gotta say, well, yeah. But it's just a few people, it's not you, and that that whole management of41401:06:49.330 --> 01:06:49.870James Crowe: correct.41501:06:49.870 --> 01:06:56.459The Alliance: The only thing you, the only thing you could do is be honest and transparent, that's all you can do. Honest and transparent.41601:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.140James Crowe: Yeah.41701:06:57.460 --> 01:07:01.089The Alliance: This is what we know today. This is a dynamic situation.41801:07:01.650 --> 01:07:06.679The Alliance: Our God, the Father is a lunatic. I don't know what to tell you.41901:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.510James Crowe: Yeah.42001:07:08.980 --> 01:07:19.590James Crowe: I think I've done a pretty good job. I mean, we have landing every Friday, and I have a I've added a financial update. This is our financial situation, and it's kind of grim, but so far so good. And you know.42101:07:19.590 --> 01:07:25.860The Alliance: Good. Alright. So yeah, I mean the only other, the only I'm gonna I'm gonna I think we should jump.42201:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.180James Crowe: Oh, yeah.42301:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.109The Alliance: The hour, but.42401:07:27.420 --> 01:07:27.730James Crowe: Know.42501:07:27.730 --> 01:07:34.230The Alliance: The only other thing again, like I think, keep focusing on you're in a crisis. How do you shrink42601:07:34.600 --> 01:07:45.640The Alliance: like, how do you start? Get like, get like, what is the how small should you get? What can you? What can you pause right to like? Yeah, like. Otherwise, it's42701:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.590The Alliance: think you're asking too much of yourself.42801:07:48.590 --> 01:07:53.240James Crowe: Yeah, yeah, no. That's been super helpful.42901:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.940The Alliance: Cool, good.43001:07:57.110 --> 01:07:57.600James Crowe: Thank you for.43101:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.160James Crowe: Wow!43201:07:58.160 --> 01:07:58.610James Crowe: But then.43301:07:58.610 --> 01:08:02.139The Alliance: Staff strategy speed. This is a43401:08:03.040 --> 01:08:15.970The Alliance: I didn't even realize I had this skill set until you asked. No, there were like 4 or 5 things there that I was like. Oh, this is like I should we? I should take the transcript of this conversation and turn into a teaching module for something.43501:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.569James Crowe: Well, you could parse it out for books. There you go.43601:08:19.910 --> 01:08:27.069The Alliance: But it's like the teams at speed, is an interesting question. I like, I don't think I'm done here. I think like this is the start of a research project. Also.43701:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.440James Crowe: Have you ever read Snuck works? Do you know that book.43801:08:30.210 --> 01:08:34.989The Alliance: Yes, I do know that book because I have read it. I have read it. It's got the plane on the cover right.43901:08:34.990 --> 01:08:38.210James Crowe: Yeah. So you know, they invented stealth and.44001:08:38.210 --> 01:08:44.089The Alliance: No, I mean, by the way. But remember, of Kelly Johnson's 14 rules for skunk. Right?44101:08:44.220 --> 01:08:48.520The Alliance: 7 of them are flow triggers, dope autonomy.44201:08:48.520 --> 01:09:13.499The Alliance: right. The other ones are literally rules.
