WEBVTT100:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.330Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hello?200:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.610The Alliance: How are you, sir?300:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.910Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm very well, thank you, how are you?400:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.850The Alliance: Super well.500:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.400The Alliance: I like how the mustache matches the hair, matches the glasses, matches the t-shirt, matches theÉ600:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.230The Alliance: phased out Blade Runner background.700:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.670Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It's crazy.800:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.409The Alliance: It's sort of like being in deep space and jumping to light speed with Frank Zappa.900:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.149Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, well, É Always wanting a mustache, so that summertime is a goodÉ No, I like it.1000:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.350The Alliance: I think it's good luck.1100:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.199The Alliance: How are you, sir? Tell me what's going on. Where are you? What's goingÉ whatÉ where you at?1200:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.060Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: É.1300:02:48.310 --> 00:02:59.219The Alliance: Here's your notes, I'm sort of up to speed, so I know that, you know, July was a challenging stretch, then you're sort of sliding back onto track, but where are you at? What's going on?1400:02:59.480 --> 00:03:09.680Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I am, I am in London, finally accomplished, or completed all the, all the summer travel.1500:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.229Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And I have to say.1600:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.290Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, it's, É on one hand, it's sort of aÉ1700:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.629Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: good thing that, in August that pretty much everyone travels here, or kind of second part of July, August, it's kind ofÉ1800:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.890Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Pretty much dead time for business, or if you'reÉ1900:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.269Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Trying to do something, it's impossible to get hold of people.2000:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.419Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But the downside of it is that it really knocks you out of any routine, É soÉ2100:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.200Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I've gotten back.2200:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Last week, and this is stillÉ2300:03:48.300 --> 00:03:56.960Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: this is still kind of the last week of this, extensive, extensive, holiday, and I'm really spending it to kind of2400:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.929Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Prepare myself for the proper entrance in the new year.2500:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: É when, when I, when I joinedÉ2600:04:05.250 --> 00:04:23.110Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the Alliance in the beginning, the biggest problem for me, has been consistency, is that I would have a few days which are absolutely cool and absolutely fantastic, and then another two days which are, like, zero added value.2700:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.630The Alliance: And now?2800:04:25.970 --> 00:04:40.699Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: IÉ I've gotten much better. I've gotten much better into it, so that'sÉ that's for sure. It's stillÉ it still is the number one problem, but it seems like I'veÉ I've seen the solution.2900:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.660Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: AndÉ.3000:04:42.660 --> 00:04:52.269The Alliance: Tell me more about that, tell me, when you say it's the number one problem, put some color around that for me, and when you say you see the solution, put some color around that for me.3100:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.850Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.3200:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.100Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: SoÉ3300:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.810Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: say Thursday, Friday, usual, usual week is, you know, has always been a high-energy time for me, so, É3400:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.170Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm already in the work, I'm quite productive, É3500:05:13.210 --> 00:05:22.110Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: can, you know, get things done, can generate new ideas, and all of that, and then Friday comes, and kind of end of the week, and I'm trying to3600:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.840Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: put enough Things for the beginning of the week.3700:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.170Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And then I would go on a weekend, AndÉ3800:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.800Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: come backÉ come back Monday with a completely different energy level. É AndÉ3900:05:38.890 --> 00:05:56.539Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it would take me a day or two to kind of rebuild that energy level until, again, Wednesday or Thursday, when things, again, becoming very energetic and all of that. And that's quite problematic, particularly for high-paced4000:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.850Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hyde-based project, because that basically meant that4100:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.729Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I either work all the time, including, like, Saturdays or Sundays, or I'm struggling to maintain4200:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.019Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Energy, energy and productivity levels, kind of week in and week out.4300:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.160The Alliance: What's the solution, y'all?4400:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.090Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: The solution, I think, is, É4500:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Trying to spread everything moreÉ more evenly.4600:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.629Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Not pushing to the limit during, during weekdays, but also, making sure4700:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.650Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that I don't fully plug out duringÉ during theÉ the weekends?4800:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.709Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Effectively doing, maybe, an hour, hour and a half worth, É4900:06:48.460 --> 00:06:57.659Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: worth ofÉ worth of work, evenÉ even duringÉ during weekends, and also spending time to prepare myself for the week on Sundays and things of that sort.5000:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.240Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So that's started to kind of help regulate.5100:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.940Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But with travel, particularly with summer travel, Where, you know.5200:07:07.150 --> 00:07:17.950Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm out for two and a half weeks at a time. Not that I'm not working in the middle, you know, I'm working, just not home, and all the routines they go toÉ they go to nothing.5300:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.289Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That wasÉ that was a challenge.5400:07:21.950 --> 00:07:31.570Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And I think the recipe is toÉ the solution is to beÉ more, É5500:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.720Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: attuned to that problem, to leave more time forÉ5600:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.199Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Decompressing and getting backÉ and getting back intoÉ5700:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.979Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Into shape, to leave more time for planning, and things of that sort.5800:07:47.440 --> 00:07:55.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: for instance, you know, 5 years ago, if I would go for a weekend trip, I sometimes would book a return flight on, say.5900:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.650Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Monday, 8 AM,6000:07:57.930 --> 00:08:11.119Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And then go to the office directly, right? Now, I would want to make sure I amÉ I'm at my home at, like, 4 PM Sunday, so that I have enough time to kind of get back intoÉ into that.6100:08:11.250 --> 00:08:21.859Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Maybe it's just, me getting a little older, orÉ Probably just be moreÉ RecognizingÉ recognizing thisÉ thisÉ6200:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.549Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Issue. Issue more and being more responsible about it.6300:08:28.400 --> 00:08:37.050The Alliance: SoÉ One, I was gonnaÉ you nailed, you nailed it. Like, the solutionÉ my experience.6400:08:37.049 --> 00:08:42.439Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I always, no matter what else is happening, even if I'm fucking hungover and beenÉ.6500:08:42.440 --> 00:09:02.119The Alliance: up late the night before, like, not behaving, I get up and I write. Every day, for at least an hour, hour and a half, sometimes two hours, sometimes four, and, you know, sometimes this past weekend, I worked the entire weekend, because it just, like, it was fun, and I was liking it, but, like.6600:09:02.120 --> 00:09:14.850The Alliance: I have to keep my hand in, otherwise the startup speed is tooÉ the cost is too high come Monday. I also always do the same thing on Sunday. I make sureÉ6700:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.760The Alliance: We've got the, you know, what's my week? What are theÉ what are theÉ what are the bigÉ6800:09:19.930 --> 00:09:32.199The Alliance: big milestones I have to hit, get clear on all that stuff, so I was going to tell you to doÉ to look at both of those things. Two things you might want to consider, one is going to sound unbelievably radically radical to you.6900:09:32.200 --> 00:09:41.519The Alliance: But explainÉ I'm gonna explain what the issue is first, and then I'm gonna explain my solution, and you're gonna hate my solution. TheÉ7000:09:41.740 --> 00:09:49.679The Alliance: The trick is, it's sort of like when you got sick with COVID. When you have this kind of schedule that's as tight as yours.7100:09:50.660 --> 00:10:05.709The Alliance: You haveÉ you'reÉ you're notÉ you're fragile. Even if everything's working, you're fragile, because if lifeÉ if two things go wrong, you don't have the cognitive bandwidth to take care of it, right? So there's not enough7200:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.100The Alliance: There'sÉ there's a littleÉ you're missing a little cushion.7300:10:10.260 --> 00:10:17.419The Alliance: in your weekly schedule. Like, when I look at it and I think, okay, that'sÉ that's all great until shit starts going wrong.7400:10:17.560 --> 00:10:29.219The Alliance: And, which is one of the reasons I liked working on the weekends. The other thing you might want to consider, and a couple people in the Alliance have taken me up on it, this, because I've told a couple other people this.7500:10:29.310 --> 00:10:49.259The Alliance: it will seem like it's insane in the beginning, but it will end up making you incredibly more productive. Ask yourself what happens if you do 10% or 20% less every day. Don't push it off to the weekends, literally just say, okay, I have toÉ I have to work 10% less, because I need a little more buffer time.7600:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.590The Alliance: What does that look like?7700:10:51.590 --> 00:11:10.730The Alliance: And when you start getting radical, you get remarkably focused with it. SoÉ and it strikes me that youÉ you're somebody who kind of likes radical experiments a little bit, so you might like saying, okay, this is fucking crazy, there's no way, but for 2 weeks, I'm gonna try to be 20% less every day and see what happens. É7800:11:10.920 --> 00:11:18.449The Alliance: is often, fairly useful. And you nailed the other one, which is, When travel gets heavy.7900:11:19.420 --> 00:11:30.579The Alliance: it's really crucial to have travel rituals, things that you do, because it's really hard to do anything on the road. Like, all I can do most of the time is, like, read and go to the gym.8000:11:30.690 --> 00:11:50.649The Alliance: So my flow travel rituals are literally, like, a half an hour a day, or 20 minutes a day, but getting them done with my workout, with the reading, keeps me very balanced on the road, right? So reading becomes my flow state, workout keeps my nervous system relaxed, and then I just make sure8100:11:51.720 --> 00:12:05.089The Alliance: to use, something likeÉ like, I'll use creativity microdosing between hectic things. Like, I've gone into bathrooms and just gone into a shower, a stall and just sketched for, like, 5 minutes, just to, like, break fucking state.8200:12:05.090 --> 00:12:25.089The Alliance: kind of stuff if you have to. I find, because it's the control that goes away, it's not even the time, it's the sense of control, and we're suchÉ like, we're wired for control. And so if you give your body theÉ if you give yourself the illusions of control, these little micro things, these little tiny rituals.8300:12:25.200 --> 00:12:36.699The Alliance: you come back more grounded. You're still crushed for time and everything else, but you're not as lost, I've noticed. So that's how I think about it, if thatÉ either of those things sound useful.8400:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.499Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, itÉ it does sound very, very useful. In terms of8500:12:43.100 --> 00:12:52.350Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: cutting, cutting down, bringing down time, that's actually the fact of what I have been doing, what I've been on a journey for quite some time.8600:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.060Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Because where I worked, it wasÉ always, like.8700:12:58.690 --> 00:13:14.819Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: pushing you to the limit. You are taking a call at 1AM, doesn't matter, wake up at 6 the next day, in any event, and then we can come, and guess what, like, you have to work, and you have to work 12 hours, or 14 hours, or 18 hours.8800:13:14.820 --> 00:13:25.070Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: this kind of thing, and that's probably what led me to a pretty bad shape to begin with. So, I think I got into a point where8900:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.950Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I've started to realize that HavingÉ9000:13:29.270 --> 00:13:41.790Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: having more time and more buffer and time for planning is actually what gives me backÉ gives me back control as a result of productivity. That, yes, I'm not maybe doing as much as9100:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.219Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I would have dreamt of doing, but I'm notÉ9200:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.960Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: doing it in the other case either, because I've just crushed and cannotÉ.9300:13:50.400 --> 00:13:57.890The Alliance: So, Anatolia, I will tell you, if you layer in a little bit of weekend work, and you stay steady.9400:13:58.150 --> 00:14:22.459The Alliance: what you're gonna notice, and this is the thing to track, if you're like me, I track projects, because it's the easiest way. My time is tricky to track. Other things, I've tried to track everything. Projects is what I end up tracking. How many completed? What I found is, when you reduce stuff down, it's sort of like, you know, it's sort of inverted with AI, but similar. But you reduce stuff down.9500:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.670The Alliance: You get less stuff during the done9600:14:24.880 --> 00:14:48.319The Alliance: During those days. And that takes a little while to get used to, because you're like, oh, fuck, I'm, right, screwing up. But what ends up happening, because you don't burn yourself out, so you don't lose as much time, and you can sort of keep things going on the road, like, keep steady. When you look back, like, I like to look back in 4-month chunks, I do it four times, or 3 times a year. I think that's the good length for projects for me.9700:14:48.320 --> 00:15:03.650The Alliance: And I'm always amazed by how much I've got done. So, like, by dialing it back, and this is sort of what I tell people with, like, ChatGBT, when they're working with ChatGPT. If you go in thinking it's gonna save you more time in the moment.9800:15:03.900 --> 00:15:22.510The Alliance: you'reÉ you're wrong. It's actually gonna take more time during the day. You'll do more work, but you will end up getting so much farther in the work that you do, that when you look back, you'll get to get less done during the day, but it's gonna be such better quality that when you look back 4 months later, you're gonna go, holy fuck, how did I do that?9900:15:22.570 --> 00:15:39.700The Alliance: It's the same sort ofÉ I noticed it's the same thing with kind of flow-based peak performance, which is why I always say, like, if flow stays at the center, you're amazed by what you get done. And when flow drifts from the center, you know, then you start fighting tooÉ a little too much against yourself.10000:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.740Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.10100:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.740Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: B.10200:15:41.740 --> 00:15:47.519The Alliance: What, what a, É and I love, by the way, I, É I wasÉ ugh.10300:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.740The Alliance: I likeÉ10400:15:49.350 --> 00:16:02.570The Alliance: a clear goal. You gotÉ I like a clear goalÉ a big clear goal session on Sunday for the week, and then, you know, every night before, you know, so I go into the next day with that map. Is that what you've been doing?10500:16:02.770 --> 00:16:10.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes, yes, exactly, exactly that. Finishing the day, basically asking what is the most important thing for tomorrow.10600:16:10.570 --> 00:16:18.840Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And where toÉ where to concentrate, and how would it look in terms ofÉ in terms ofÉ success.10700:16:20.380 --> 00:16:33.120The Alliance: This is tangential, but I wanted to say it before I forget it, because in your notes, you asked a question about using business communication as a microdose substitute between tasks on your clear goal list, right?10800:16:33.340 --> 00:16:52.729The Alliance: I think that's awesome, and it was actually a suggestion I was gonna make for you, so IÉ when I steal styles, if you don't want to steal styles from authors, go back, so you can find this online, in the 90s, in the 1990s, it was the last era of, like, legendary print journalism.10900:16:53.020 --> 00:17:05.450The Alliance: and legendary print journalism advertising. This was the Nike Just Do It campaign. This was all that stuff. Go steal styles from 90s print ads.11000:17:05.760 --> 00:17:23.289The Alliance: because they were the best I've ever seen at headlines, and, like, the exact thing you're trying to do, it's a great idea. It's an awesome idea, I love it. It's really good. I'm gonna suggest it at the next alliance, for people during this DLS style thing, because it'sÉ11100:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.469The Alliance: a really good idea. And I, you know, stealing marketing copy is something in business.11200:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.780The Alliance: Oh my god, if you could write a fucking good headline, to an email, to a billboard, to anything.11300:17:36.080 --> 00:17:46.369The Alliance: it's huge. So, like, do that. Fucking do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really do that. That's a brilliant idea, and I think you could really unlock some stuff with it. É.11400:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Man.11500:17:48.960 --> 00:17:55.169Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That's cool. I had another one, actually, in terms of creativity to microdosing.11600:17:57.190 --> 00:18:06.779Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So IÉ one of theÉ one of the trips I took in the last, in the last month, I think I told you aboutÉ about this, where we were kind of co-creating music.11700:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.070The Alliance: Yeah.11800:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Which, which wasÉ11900:18:10.080 --> 00:18:19.939Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Absolutely amazing. For, like, a group of 20 people, of whom probably 15 don't have any musical experience whatsoever.12000:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.109Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: To get into jamming sessions. Like, on the second day, there was already enough, kind of, understanding to get people into jamming sessions, with veryÉ12100:18:30.320 --> 00:18:44.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: with very, very, very basic instruments overlapping with electronic, synthesizers and all of that stuff. And people were having so much fun, and really gettingÉ really getting into flow. É12200:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Was a very cool and beautiful thing to see.12300:18:50.330 --> 00:18:58.150Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But what I brought from it was a, É Like, a super easy, É app.12400:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.780Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: For creating electronic music.12500:19:01.880 --> 00:19:11.729Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So I started trying that as a, as a creativity microdose. So, in the middle, in the middle of the day, between, between, kind of, bigÉ12600:19:11.950 --> 00:19:24.310Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: parts of the day, for instance, I try to do the first part of the day with deep work, and second with meeting. So in the middle, I'll take, you know, a 15-minute break and play a little bit of, a little bit of music.12700:19:24.310 --> 00:19:34.460The Alliance: That's dope. That's perfect. Yeah, I mean, allÉ literally, the truth of the matter is this. You want a little bit of creativity.12800:19:34.560 --> 00:19:47.300The Alliance: and you want low-grade physical movement. Not exercise, just, like, using your fingers, using your body a little bit. That does it. That, like, that's all you're trying to do. You're just trying to, like.12900:19:47.300 --> 00:19:56.280The Alliance: turn off the brain, because if you give it that second to turn off the brain, what it really does is it clears out13000:19:56.280 --> 00:20:07.920The Alliance: some of the shit in short-term memory, right? So you actually go into your next meeting with more RAM. It's less easy, it's harder to be overloaded, there's all that shit. So I think that's a dope idea. I used to, É13100:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.590The Alliance: Do DJ mixes.13200:20:10.980 --> 00:20:30.920The Alliance: That was, like, I haven't done it in a long time, but back in the, early 2000s, you know, all my friends were DJs, so I was just, like, you know, layeringÉ I was layering quoteÉ like, I would lay out, like, Churchill speeches on top of, like, you know, some kind of hip-hop or whatever, just for the fun of it.13300:20:31.020 --> 00:20:36.750The Alliance: But it really worked well for me. What else can IÉ can I help you solve today?13400:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: É13500:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.500Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, I, I, I think, as, asÉ13600:20:48.130 --> 00:20:56.130Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: The topic forÉ the topic for this month isÉ is group flow, and frankly speaking, that has beenÉ13700:20:58.510 --> 00:21:07.060Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: probably the more interesting part for me. Not that others were not interesting, it's the partÉ WhichÉ13800:21:07.970 --> 00:21:14.300Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It's basically the reason why, why I came, right?13900:21:14.810 --> 00:21:23.680Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: wanted to join, because I am building a business, and I wanted to have it on a foundation, on the very right foundation, É14000:21:23.860 --> 00:21:32.400Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And IÉ I think the question is, howÉ how can I advance that? WhatÉ is there a direction, books, orÉ14100:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: some particular people, to pay attention to.14200:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.269The Alliance: Group flow? Group flow?14300:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.710The Alliance: Yeah, so, the classicÉ14400:21:43.890 --> 00:21:56.730The Alliance: classic book of the genre, the first real book on it that everybody should read. It's Keith Sawyer. He's one of the world's leading creativity researchers, and his book is called Group Genius.14500:21:57.120 --> 00:22:05.119The Alliance: And, É he, É he did the original work on Group Flow, he was aÉ he became the keyboardist14600:22:05.380 --> 00:22:18.950The Alliance: jazz keyÉ or the keyboardist for Second City Television, the big comedy feeder troupe that fed into Saturday Night Live and produced many of America's comedic greats in the past 20 years, 30 years. So he recorded14700:22:18.950 --> 00:22:36.329The Alliance: them for almost a decade, videotaped every performance, used audience laughter as a signal for group flow, and then worked backwards to what triggered it. So he wrote the foundational book, it's amazing. And then if you haven't read, Jeff Vanderholt's work.14800:22:36.390 --> 00:22:41.660The Alliance: He's the god of group flow, and É14900:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.280The Alliance: So, he wroteÉ he wrote a book called Team Flow, that is the modern Bible.15000:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.269Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Was that right?15100:22:48.610 --> 00:22:57.110The Alliance: Okay, so Team Flows to the Modern Bible, Group, Group Geniuses before that, and É É15200:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.740The Alliance: MuhammadÉ15300:23:03.290 --> 00:23:22.200The Alliance: Fuck, what is Mohamed's last name? It was justÉ weÉ I've worked with him. Mohammed Shahada. He's at UCLA. So in 2022, Muhammad determinedÉ he's the guy who did the fMRI work, that determined, or the EEG work, that there's an actual signal15400:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.239The Alliance: For group flow in the brain.15500:23:24.940 --> 00:23:36.410The Alliance: And, so if you want the technical, his work, and if you really want to go crazy, like, in the technical, this is not really group flow, but it is underneath15600:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.020The Alliance: All of it.15700:23:38.470 --> 00:23:55.929The Alliance: Scott Kelso, who we work with and we write papers with, is the godfather of social neuroscience and a field known as coordination dynamics. Coordination dynamics is literally, like, the field of how anything from pendulums to brains15800:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.529The Alliance: work together.15900:23:58.030 --> 00:24:13.720The Alliance: And, so Scott's got tons of different papers on social neuroscience, etc, that are kind of interesting, but it's reallyÉ it's far afield, but you likeÉ you like math, you like geeky, so you might like Scott's work.16000:24:13.720 --> 00:24:23.010The Alliance: I think of it as, like, nobody would ever point at it and say he's doing group flow, but, like, he's Michael Mentor's, Michael Menino's.16100:24:23.010 --> 00:24:36.060The Alliance: PhD advisor, right, Michael? And, like, we work with Scott all the time, so we really think about group flow in terms of his work a lot, if you want to go super techy on it. And there's alsoÉ16200:24:36.110 --> 00:24:44.919The Alliance: a treasure trove of papers, like, coming out. People have been researching group flow, so we're getting our first papers, and then, É16300:24:45.450 --> 00:24:54.219The Alliance: I, you know, Michael Menino, on my team has got to be one of the world's leaders in that, from his work with Synergy and everything else.16400:24:54.490 --> 00:25:01.009The Alliance: AsÉ as well. Those are theÉ those are theÉ it'sÉ and by the way, it's the under-researched field, right? Like, this isÉ.16500:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Nope.16600:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.199The Alliance: This is what's next.16700:25:03.370 --> 00:25:10.459The Alliance: Because we're just starting to get, like, as we pointed out, the signals for, these signals, right? Like.16800:25:13.850 --> 00:25:20.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So, with synergy, because that's, that's actually the second question I wanted, I wanted to ask.16900:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.820Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: A very practical, very practical, É17000:25:26.010 --> 00:25:36.979Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: part for my business model. We're basically acquiring companies, and we're looking to introduce certain practices there, with the hope that flowÉ.17100:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.700The Alliance: Yeah, you wantÉ I mean, Anatoly, you want Synergy as your back end.17200:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.229The Alliance: because itÉ it works over Zoom calls, it gives youÉ17300:25:45.370 --> 00:25:50.290The Alliance: Everything from psychological safety and trust to, É17400:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.520The Alliance: Neural entrainment in real time on a dashboard with feedback.17500:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.630The Alliance: AndÉ Done.17600:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.310Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It isÉ.17700:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.500The Alliance: It's built, it exists, it's a platform.17800:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.140Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: We don't exist.17900:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.460The Alliance: Oh, yeah.18000:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.040Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Or you canÉ.18100:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.259The Alliance: It's soÉ It's surprising.18200:26:11.710 --> 00:26:28.629The Alliance: it's the firstÉ use it, just test it out. Like, I'll put you in touch with Michael if you want, and youÉ like, they're notÉ they've got a lowÉ their monthly cost for a team is not all that high, especially now, because they're starting out.18300:26:29.090 --> 00:26:39.150The Alliance: you just test it. Like, we found it. We're using it in our research for PTSD. Like, we're gonna use it in our group therapy sessions for PTSD.18400:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Right.18500:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.180Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and it willÉ it willÉ18600:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.169Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Basically, provide data on the kind ofÉ18700:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.339Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: environment there is on a Zoom communication?18800:26:54.750 --> 00:27:12.350The Alliance: Yeah, it goÉ it does real-time semantic analysis, and it, tracks a bunch of, biometrics through the camera in yourÉ through your camera, so it's looking at your forehead and your veinÉ the vein in your forehead, infrared heat, galvanic skin response, it tracks a lot of stuff.18900:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.169The Alliance: It's got a lotÉ they got a lot of data in there.19000:27:16.410 --> 00:27:22.149The Alliance: And, yeah, and by the way, you'll, you'llÉ soÉ19100:27:22.150 --> 00:27:42.029The Alliance: it's different, but a similar engine underlies the AI technology we're using for you guys that you guys are going to play with when I'm with you in New York, because we're going to give you, you know, hey, this is your program going forward, based on all the data we've accumulated together. It's the same engine, different sort of outputs.19200:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.790Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Right, okay.19300:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.169Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: É But do you know of any, É19400:27:51.990 --> 00:28:02.880Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of tools who could give upfront diagnostics. So, I understand that this is great for, kind of maintaining and understanding the.19500:28:03.410 --> 00:28:16.800The Alliance: Oh, no, this isn'tÉ you can use it diagnostically, like, if you record two weeks' worth of Zoom calls with your team, you can just send it to them, and say, can you analyze this and give me a report? So yeah, you can doÉ you can do either.19600:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.679Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But, is there some sort of, like, a standardÉ standard test? NotÉ not thatÉ.19700:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.239The Alliance: Well, for group flow?19800:28:26.240 --> 00:28:35.460Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Not so much for group flow, butÉ you see, we're acquiring a company, and we're hoping that we're going to take them on the journey and explain all of that.19900:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And how to understand where they are on the spectrum.20000:28:38.830 --> 00:28:50.170The Alliance: Oh, baseline. Yeah, so, no. As a matter of fact, thereÉ yeah, it'sÉ that'sÉ and it onlyÉ like, weÉ so the diagnostic you guys got.20100:28:50.280 --> 00:28:58.630The Alliance: at the front end of this, isÉ I don't want to say it's as cutting edge as the field gets, but itÉ because I didn'tÉ20200:28:58.650 --> 00:29:12.349The Alliance: there's a bunch of stuff I could have folded in but chose not to to save your time, like, because I was valuing your time. If you have an endless, like, if they want to be acquired, and they have to take hours of diagnostics, you can layer in more stuff.20300:29:12.360 --> 00:29:21.489The Alliance: We really had to develop our own, because the stuff, like, to do flow work, right, at all, you need to know a number of things thatÉ20400:29:21.880 --> 00:29:34.099The Alliance: other assessments. Like, you need to know strengths, obviously, because when people work at the intersection of their strengths, it's flowy. You need to know goals and goal hierarchies. You also need to know20500:29:34.100 --> 00:29:48.170The Alliance: If their flow triggers are integrated, distraction management levels, how burned out are they? All this stuff. We've had to craft our own. I haven't seen a cognitive health diagnostic on the front end that knows what it's looking at.20600:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.349The Alliance: We've built our own.20700:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.790Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay.20800:29:53.100 --> 00:30:04.829The Alliance: And the mostÉ and then the thing, like, the thing to remember also is, so with most diagnostics, they don't do things likeÉ you guys, I believe, one of the questions you answered was, whatÉ what is the weight of lightning?20900:30:05.130 --> 00:30:05.990The Alliance: Right?21000:30:07.160 --> 00:30:17.630The Alliance: That seems like a nonsensical question to most people, right? Like, it's a funny question, or it's a nonsensical question, but your answer tells me 3 thingsÉ 4 things.21100:30:17.670 --> 00:30:29.779The Alliance: One, everybody's pressed for time when they're taking the diagnostic, because they don't want to take a fucking diagnostic, so I can figure out how fast your brain is, whether or not your answer is funny or not.21200:30:30.000 --> 00:30:45.400The Alliance: I can figure out if you're a convergent thinker or a divergent thinker by your answer, and, like, 3 or 4 other things that are useful for me in terms of assessing creativity and thingsÉ and humor, and just things along those lines. So, like.21300:30:45.400 --> 00:31:03.210The Alliance: nobody does that in standard diagnostics. They don't exist, right? Nobody throws in non sequiturs, but I was like, no, these really tell us something, right? And no diagnostic wouldÉ like, I asked hip-hop or punk, I should have asked a bigger, broader music question, but if you tell me what music you like.21400:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.460The Alliance: I know a fuckton about you.21500:31:05.490 --> 00:31:20.879The Alliance: Because I'm both a peak performance expert and a music journalist. So, like, you tell me what you're listening to, I know what subculture you identify with, I know what drugs you like, I know what you did as a teenager, probably.21600:31:20.890 --> 00:31:30.809The Alliance: Right? Just byÉ because you tell me what you're listening to. So, like, you gotta think in terms of the information you actually want, also. Like, I wantÉ.21700:31:30.810 --> 00:31:31.400Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Very true.21800:31:31.400 --> 00:31:31.850The Alliance: Exactly.21900:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.580Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Showing and signaling, É signaling question.22000:31:37.310 --> 00:31:47.599The Alliance: Yeah, so I asked a lot of those kinds of signalingÉ yeah, signaling questions, just because it'll give meÉ it'll give me information that helps me,22100:31:47.840 --> 00:31:55.489The Alliance: level set among the group, you know what I mean? If I've got a whole group full of people who said, I don't like punk or hip-hop.22200:31:56.130 --> 00:32:14.860The Alliance: I've got to present my information very differently, you know what I mean? Like, I got a group of people where everybody chose punk or hip-hop, like, they had a distinct choice, and they had something to say, or they chose both, or whatever. Like, I didn't care. I just wanted to make sure I had my people in the room, and that's a shorthand for my people.22300:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.350Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That's, yeah, that's very smart.22400:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.150Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Very cool.22500:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.989The Alliance: You know. My point is that when you build diagnostics.22600:32:26.040 --> 00:32:44.299The Alliance: Scientists always take, like, 7 questions to get an answer, and I'm like, you're asking the wrong fucking questions. Like, getÉ like, think about this in real life, like, don't try toÉ like, because for me, I have to be able to steer you guys. You've got to be able to steer a company. You don't have to validate anything.22700:32:45.140 --> 00:32:57.770The Alliance: anywhere until, like, you scale something. You'reÉ you'reÉ so you gotta literally, like, think about it as, like, no, no, no, what does Anatoly need to know about these people?22800:32:57.770 --> 00:33:10.079The Alliance: to really help them. Not what would be standard, because those are different, and if you just go from what's out there, you're gonna get, like, you know, our stuff. And by the way, and other things, here's the best.22900:33:10.230 --> 00:33:17.710The Alliance: I built my diagnostic. The first time you took it, I went back to my team, I was like, this is fucking great, but I have no idea what ADB does for a living.23000:33:19.890 --> 00:33:28.859The Alliance: I literally, like, I wasÉ I left out the mostÉ like, I was like, IÉ these people sound amazing, or kinda crazy, but I couldÉ I need the context.23100:33:28.860 --> 00:33:40.989The Alliance: So remember that conÉ when you're building it, context is gonna matter too, right? What do you need? Like, it was the funniest thing in the world, because, like, of course I don'tÉ like, it's a me. I forgot to ask the simplest question.23200:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.219The Alliance: What's your fucking job?23300:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.350Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Beautiful.23400:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, É Thank you, thank you very much.23500:33:50.470 --> 00:33:55.940The Alliance: I'm fucking late now. I got a job. Will I see you in New York?23600:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.100Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah?23700:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.720Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: É.23800:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.160The Alliance: Good!23900:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.600Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Looking forward to it very much, and thank you.24000:34:02.480 --> 00:34:19.220The Alliance: You are totally welcome. Thank you. Are you having fun, by the way? I just realized I have 5 more minutes. MyÉ it's at 2.15, it's not 2. Good. I was mad at my team, I looked at it, I was like, are you fucking kidding me? I'm not supposed to be wedged like that. I got a few minutes. Are you having fun? Are you liking the alliance?24100:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.719Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I, I am having fun, yeah, É24200:34:22.629 --> 00:34:31.059Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I have established a couple of very productive, kind of side conversations, side relationships.24300:34:31.329 --> 00:34:34.479Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And all of this, and that has been working out.24400:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.340The Alliance: I do?24500:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.399Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Primarily, brine.24600:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.929Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah. So heÉ24700:34:45.030 --> 00:35:04.019Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: he invested a lot of time in talking to me. I mean, a lot, I mean hours. And I think it changed my view on a very important piece of what we're doing, so that has been extremely, extremely helpful.24800:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.220The Alliance: Oh, great.24900:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.690The Alliance: I'm glad.25000:35:08.060 --> 00:35:14.440Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes. I wish there would have been a little more in-person opportunities.25100:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.519Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But, you know, I'mÉ.25200:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.210The Alliance: Yeah, weÉ.25300:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.720Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Transatlantic flights.25400:35:20.720 --> 00:35:33.150The Alliance: Yeah, one of the things we learned, and this was aÉ I told everybody, I was like, we're gonna get some stuff wrong, because it's the first time out, and we'll fix it when we turn it into a year-long program, or whatever it is.25500:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.799The Alliance: I should haveÉ the pop-ups were dumb.25600:35:37.900 --> 00:35:57.819The Alliance: It would have been easier for everybody if I had just done, like, 3 events, period. Like, you know, like, just 3 days, even if one of them was just, hey, meet in California, we'll go for hikes, and have lunch, and, you know, have one conversation about neuroscience or something. Like, everybody's schedule is really busy.25700:35:57.970 --> 00:36:04.489The Alliance: And, É More time in advance allows more people to come to events.25800:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.979The Alliance: so thatÉ We'll live and learn on that one.25900:36:08.750 --> 00:36:09.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hmm.26000:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But otherwise, you know, it's beenÉ it's been amazing, and I'm really happy.26100:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.070The Alliance: I'm glad.26200:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.650Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Alright, New York, by the way, I would justÉ.26300:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.330The Alliance: remember, I didn't have a clue what the space was gonna look like.26400:36:23.440 --> 00:36:34.219The Alliance: It was a subway station that my friend bought, and he was turning into this extravaganza, art space, club, yoga studio, weed store, right? Like, that's all I knew.26500:36:35.270 --> 00:36:50.430The Alliance: It is really fucking cool. He built a beautifulÉ like, it'sÉ I saw it, and I was like, whoa! That isÉ whoa! I neverÉ it was totally like, huh, I'd never seenÉ I don't knowÉ I don't even know how to describe it. It's likeÉ26600:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.680The Alliance: If you tookÉ a classic Vegas.26700:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.699Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: casino, not casino, but, like, the Vegas, whatever, from, like, the 50s, with the really slank, ornate era.26800:37:02.800 --> 00:37:18.630The Alliance: and then made it postmodern in a weird way. Like, I don't know how heÉ I've never seen anything that quite looks like it, and it's really cool. I was like, wow, it's a fuckingÉ I mean, maybe it's different in person, and I'll swallow my words, but É when I was looking at thatÉ.26900:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.629Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, where is it? Where is it doing that?27000:37:20.630 --> 00:37:30.460The Alliance: So, the reason we did it is my friend bought a 10,000 square foot abandoned subway station in Tribeca.27100:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.810Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: in Tribeca.27200:37:31.810 --> 00:37:56.650The Alliance: In New York. It's actually in SoHo. It's in SoHo, in New York. And I was like, wait, you've got 10,000 square feet of subway station in SoHo? Like, whenÉ who finds 10,000 square feet in New York City? Like, thatÉ no, that doesn't fucking ever happen, right? And I was like, well, you had me at abandoned subway station. That, in itself, is likeÉ soÉ and I just bet on him, because I knowÉ I know him, I know his dad.27300:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.060The Alliance: I, like, I just like him, and É27400:38:00.530 --> 00:38:13.919The Alliance: heÉ he hit it out of the park. He's an old restaurateur, so, like, of course he hit it out of the park with the core, but I didn't know. And I saw it, and I was like, oh, this is badass. I'mÉ this could be fun. Like, just a good space to be in, and we'reÉ theÉ27500:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.260The Alliance: Scott Barry Kaufman.27600:38:17.830 --> 00:38:29.020The Alliance: who I think is now going by Professor Amazing, or The Amazing Professor. We're gonna get a 45-minute mentalism magic show.27700:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.879The Alliance: and cognitive psychology explanation in one. So, likeÉ27800:38:35.740 --> 00:38:45.800The Alliance: worth the price of admission. Like, I don't know what's gonna happen, but worth the price of admission, as far as I'm concerned. And did you seeÉ were you there for, É27900:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.170The Alliance: Jody and Ivy?28000:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.310Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No, but I, I watched afterwards.28100:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.799The Alliance: I thought that was one of the coolest conversations I've ever been part of.28200:38:58.000 --> 00:39:14.889Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: goingÉ going into the program, when I looked at all the events, I thought, okay, this isÉ this is probably going to be myÉ my highlight, particularly in theÉ in the areas whichÉ which, I'm interested in, and IÉ and I watched the video, it'sÉ it's amazing.28300:39:15.310 --> 00:39:22.309The Alliance: Yeah, IÉ I reallyÉ I wasÉ I was blown away. We, like, weÉ we thought it wasÉ we wereÉ all of us were, like.28400:39:22.310 --> 00:39:36.870The Alliance: what just happened? We need a TV show. Literally, I've got emails from Ivy and Jody going back and forth with me, saying, hey, we should do this as a thing. That was something. And I was like, yeah, I don't know what the fuck that was. That was something.28500:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.120The Alliance: Alright, I gotta go.28600:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.819The Alliance: I'll see you in New York. I love the mustache.
