WEBVTT100:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.539The Alliance: Oh.200:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.000The Alliance: hello!300:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.140Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hello!400:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.229The Alliance: Hey! How are you? I'm pouring myself more coffee500:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.710The Alliance: didn't mean to leave you hagging600:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.300The Alliance: empty chair at all. How are you.700:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.410Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm very well, thank you. How are you?800:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.019The Alliance: I'm well, thank you. Are you back in London?900:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.929Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, big trouble with the weather. We're.1000:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.870The Alliance: We have like 100 mile an hour winds, and it took out all the power lines in town.1100:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.860The Alliance: it happens, but it usually doesn't happen in May.1200:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.220The Alliance: I don't think anybody was prepared for it in bay. I was like, this is what happens to the front end of a blizzard.1300:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.457The Alliance: It's also making a very good case. Why, I need to go move to Starlink.1400:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay.1500:02:59.620 --> 00:03:14.026The Alliance: Get off. Get off the system I'm using now, because this did like I could take it when it doesn't fuck with calls with other people, but when it starts messing with the Alliance I I lose my temper. So anyways, let's jump in. We have an hour.1600:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.439The Alliance: I have to say, we're not going to talk about this right now, but there's no way you're getting out of the alliance until we have a conversation about Kabbalah.1700:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.810Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Sure.1800:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.320The Alliance: Novel is about Kabbalah. I don't know if you know that my very 1st novel is about Kabbalah.1900:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.150Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Really.2000:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.109Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So I didn't know that.2100:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.759The Alliance: Yeah, I it was about well, you know, you probably know this. In the 13th century most of the original writings of Kabbalah2200:03:39.930 --> 00:04:05.579The Alliance: got taken by Ferdinand Isabella. Right? Jews paid their tithe. And and and those books are still under lock and key in the Vatican today. So I just asked the really simple question, what happens if we break into the Vatican to steal back one of the like most mystical books in history, like what happens if it's like, and I was really curious about the like. Weird. I won't. I'll stop here. But the question of like what happens if, like2300:04:05.740 --> 00:04:29.739The Alliance: normal people, me, you and 4 other people from the Alliance do something or like. Let's go break into the Vatican, steal back a mystical book. If that book actually turns out to be mystical like, what if it has legit powers? What if you stumble into that question? So I was. These were early like, they're really it's really a book about flow, but I had no idea what I was trying to write about at the time, like I didn't know you know what I mean. Now I look back.2400:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.080Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm right now.2500:04:30.080 --> 00:04:46.169The Alliance: I know what I'm talking about, but I don't know what I'm talking about yet. So it's pretty funny. But yeah, I read a lot about Kabbalah. My Rabbi told me I wasn't allowed to study Kabbalah until I became a Torah expert and was 40 years old, and a whole bunch of other stuff, and I said, You know, like I usually said to most people who told me no fuck off.2600:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.480The Alliance: you know I discovered Gersham scholam on my own, and, you know went from there.2700:04:54.455 --> 00:05:08.939Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Have to say. I have dropped it intentionally in- in the in the application, because, had a from what you were saying, I had a really strong feeling that- that you're into that. And I was like, I really need need to talk to Steven about that, because.2800:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.819Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: frankly, the overlaps are are such that it's it's.2900:05:13.820 --> 00:05:29.519The Alliance: Well, I I also. So I have my new novel. Actually, it's about a lot of things. But one of the core questions is the question of essentially like, why this design for the planet Earth, like what like? It's a bad design.3000:05:29.630 --> 00:05:51.709The Alliance: So if you're looking for answers at any level, one of them is the breaking of the Sephiro. Right? I mean, like most major religions, have a version of that story. The Jewish version is particularly odd and interesting, and like telling. It's very detailed, like it's very, very. It's not like, you know, the Iroquois believe that, like3100:05:51.710 --> 00:06:02.360The Alliance: Earth, mother got curious and dug up the tree of the life and fell through a hole underneath. And that's how this universe was born. Okay, that's 1 version of the story. But it's not very specific.3200:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.310The Alliance: Probably you're like, Wow, you guys learned quite a bit about like the birth of the universe.3300:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.854The Alliance: anyways. So tell me, I read your your brief email. Thank you for that.3400:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.010The Alliance: and I've taken a look we didn't get it on a good onboarding call. But3500:06:23.880 --> 00:06:36.466The Alliance: tell me what your goal is with the alliance. What? What? What's the project? We wanna advance the most while we're together. And then, judging from the massive data dump that was3600:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.690The Alliance: our our time together. What stuck with you as a place to start? Did anything stick with you as a place to start, etc, etc?3700:06:46.109 --> 00:06:50.529Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So let me maybe say a few a few things. What kind of3800:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.889Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: on on top of my mind.3900:06:53.890 --> 00:06:54.920The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, please.4000:06:55.380 --> 00:07:03.256Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: For this time. I'm not sure how. My, how, to what extent everything lands with the lines. But basically, my4100:07:03.830 --> 00:07:10.920Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: my goal is to get this business off the ground and simply put, I4200:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.199Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I think there are 2 ways of 2 ways off4300:07:17.420 --> 00:07:29.820Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of working it's 0 sum game and and the the working together game. And I am of kind of very firm belief that we are as a humanity4400:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.430Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: going through this transformation towards the point where it's the4500:07:34.690 --> 00:07:51.259Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it's the doing things together, which is gonna matter. And that's kind of my my really thing. So I really thought, okay, how can I, you know, do that and get on that? Get on that track? Particularly in the age of AI. And I basically want to4600:07:51.880 --> 00:08:07.699Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: promote that idea as much as possible with the tools I know and the tools I know is M and A, and investing in companies and all that. So I'm trying to work out the system of how to make this company where we buy other companies, and then we are4700:08:10.390 --> 00:08:17.160Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: empowering the teams to work, to change their culture, to adopt technology, to adopt AI and4800:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.950Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: transform kind of to the future. And that would include4900:08:21.740 --> 00:08:28.599Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: quite a bit of quite a bit of the work on the culture for for me.5000:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.279Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Did does it make sense.5100:08:32.690 --> 00:08:49.950The Alliance: So a part of me is laughing because so I've got a new book with Peter Diamandis, and the book is really about. It's a survival guide, for the age of abundance, like abundance, is here, and it actually brings a lot of unintended consequences with it, and5200:08:50.200 --> 00:09:10.670The Alliance: and raises the tremendous amounts of existential threats, and, in my opinion, the only way to solve those is cooperation at scale at a scale we've never been able to achieve before. I believe it's probably neurotech enabled AI enhanced sort of like a hybrid senotar model5300:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.819The Alliance: future. But it's really important to me that it's not just5400:09:15.970 --> 00:09:30.999The Alliance: improve performance. It's all the things that have come up out of like consciousness, raising technology about compassion and cooperation like those are the issues to me of the of the modern world. So that sounds like we're very deeply aligned on these ideas.5500:09:31.700 --> 00:09:40.919Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I saw I saw I had a business right, which I thought is a great idea, and I saw it collapse in front of me, almost bringing me down.5600:09:41.377 --> 00:10:03.969Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Due to people just not talking together, not working. They're not talking to each other. And similarly, at the same time I saw the same happening in the private equity firm where I was a partner, where, you know, we were on a sort of stellar track to kind of become the superstars. And then people just stopped working with each other, and everything started to burn in flames5700:10:03.970 --> 00:10:15.229Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and to like looking at this, the solution is actually like super easy for me. I mean, conceptually, right, not implement implementation, but conceptually. And5800:10:16.300 --> 00:10:26.760Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that's that's kind of what's on top of my mind. In particular, how to get people, and and I think you would. You would not have those quest answers to those questions, how to get people5900:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.569Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: who are not open to the idea6000:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.750Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: can to buy into it.6100:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.140Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: For instance, my sister is6200:10:38.710 --> 00:10:54.980Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like a highly successful lawyer. She won like best lawyer in the world, Award. Once she has 3 kids. She's like, has this massive job, all of that stuff all at the same time together, and all that. And we're very close. She's like a mother to me.6300:10:55.120 --> 00:11:02.570Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So we sit down just before New Year, and I just as a matter of kind of joke, or to start the conversation or6400:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.750Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: ask her so6500:11:05.010 --> 00:11:13.349Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of have you? Have you put down the goals for next year, which you know, going through through everything in the in the flow.6600:11:14.175 --> 00:11:18.274Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: In the flow world. That's kind of an obvious thing to do, right?6700:11:18.700 --> 00:11:40.889Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And to her I didn't even meant anything, and she like lost it? She lost it. She started. She almost kind of said, I'm leaving the dinner, said you, and your kind of performance, bullshit. Stop that like. I have no time to do that. I have a kid and a whole kids and home and a job like. I have no time for your kind of self improvement. Nonsense! Blah! Blah! Blah!6800:11:42.073 --> 00:11:44.089Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That's mine. That's kind of.6900:11:44.090 --> 00:12:00.740The Alliance: Warn you. So my brother is the vice chair of Lathan and Watkins, which is the largest law firm in the world, and he runs it with 2 other people, and I will tell you from long fucking experience, the 3, the hardest people to7000:12:00.870 --> 00:12:30.065The Alliance: yet into the human performance conversation, accountants and lawyers because they have retroactive fear based jobs. And it's really they're facing the wrong direction to even see it's really wild. So really, I've not solved it. By the way, I've just encountered it like you have, like, it's a wall, and you're just like Whoa! Fuck me. Sometimes lawyers come come to me, but it's it's really yeah, it's tricky. So I've seen that.7100:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.172The Alliance: I so let me.7200:12:35.220 --> 00:12:47.080The Alliance: I want to use this time to to. You know, this. This is your time for me to help you solve whatever is the biggest thing in front of you, is it? Are you just out of curiosity?7300:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.330The Alliance: How7400:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.549The Alliance: firm is the business model. How firm is your strategy! How firm is everything that you're doing on that side, is it.7500:12:55.828 --> 00:12:56.940Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Right now. It isn't.7600:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.260The Alliance: Okay.7700:12:57.260 --> 00:13:10.409Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Right now. We haven't bought anything. We haven't raised any capital, so far as kind of goes on on our own effort. We don't have any employees. So just 3 partners and it's7800:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.669Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it's sort of very young, but it can get very advanced very quickly, because.7900:13:14.670 --> 00:13:35.190The Alliance: Let me ask you a question. So one like, if I was think so, I my part, you probably you actually might be able to. I don't know if you could buy the company out from under him, but you could definitely probably invest in it at this point. I think I think they're still looking. They're still doing funny stuff. So. But Michael Menino is my chief science officer. He has a new company called Synergy.8000:13:35.260 --> 00:13:48.289The Alliance: Energy is really cool it it basically through zoom cameras. So if you have a meeting at work, it will. It does real time. Somatic analysis8100:13:48.520 --> 00:13:56.452The Alliance: reads blood flow reads a whole bunch of other stuff through the camera and through AI, and what it measures is8200:13:57.080 --> 00:14:26.540The Alliance: brand entrainment, synchrony levels of trust and so psychological safety, and it offers either real time tuning or afterwards coaching right? It sort of nudges people towards synchrony. But what we found is that the tech. This technology increased productivity group productivity, 3 X productivity group group performance by 19 and increased group flow by 15%.8300:14:26.820 --> 00:14:48.449The Alliance: So we we're starting to see like this is the 1st wave of of what I think about. When I think about stuff you're talking about. I'm like this is. I write about his company in the chapter I'm I'm writing about like to me. It's the frontier of sort of neurotech, and it's it's A AI with a wellness layer, and it's8400:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.460The Alliance: it's the stuff that, like8500:14:50.670 --> 00:15:01.980The Alliance: the Bci conversations are missing. Like it. I I like. I like some of the Bci work. I like some of the Bci thinking, but it only it doesn't solve the actual.8600:15:01.980 --> 00:15:31.639The Alliance: It gives us access to better information and faster processing, but until it gives us access to co-OP cooperation and scale. It doesn't matter, as far as I could tell. So Menino's company is one of those where I'm like, huh? Yeah, you're the. You're the 1st one through the gate that I've seen. I'm on the board. And because like and I don't join the board of it like I say, no all the time. But this one I was like, oh, no! You like this is legit real. This has got to be. The future. Is that what we're talking about here, investing in those kinds of companies.8700:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.689The Alliance: Like building a portfolio of things.8800:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.090Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No, it's it's different which we're talking about buying.8900:15:40.540 --> 00:15:48.120Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Say, a really old school company which does things very traditional.9000:15:49.090 --> 00:15:57.899Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: using that tool in house and training, coaching the team to kind of grow into that mindset9100:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and grow.9200:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.880The Alliance: You're gonna teach. You want to teach Kodak how you want to teach Kodak how to become Instagram.9300:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Kind of yes.9400:16:07.300 --> 00:16:16.839Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: because listen. At the end of the day a lot of people in those smaller companies, smaller businesses that are very kind of honest, hardworking guys, right? They didn't have the luxury of.9500:16:16.840 --> 00:16:27.329The Alliance: Are you? But, by the way, let me just stop. You have a second. You're cause you just said something. I want to be clear. So you're targeting. You're not targeting giant companies. You're targeting like mid level companies and stuff.9600:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.820The Alliance: Yes, yes, yes.9700:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.080The Alliance: Got it. Got it? Got it? Got it, by the way, okay, so let me stop now and say9800:16:33.230 --> 00:16:43.209The Alliance: this, you don't have to like I get it. This is a cool idea. I totally get it because they're legacy organizations. They don't have the time or the null. They don't know what the fuck to do.9900:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.659The Alliance: Basically, they need.10000:16:45.009 --> 00:16:55.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: On the side roads for for all of this stuff, the big, the big, the big guys. They do smart stuff sometimes scary stuff, but they do things right, these people10100:16:56.290 --> 00:17:03.870Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it. It's like they they run accounting on on handwritten notes. It's like it's the easiest thing to automate.10200:17:03.870 --> 00:17:09.050The Alliance: No, I mean, by the way, and I told you this was, in a sense, one of the reasons I wanted to start the alliance.10300:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.510The Alliance: Just put it is, I started to notice that my friends were creative leaders10400:17:14.980 --> 00:17:31.140The Alliance: were getting lapped by AI. They were not like they weren't investigating the technology, or if they were, they were doing like one thing with it, like they were using chat, gpt. But that was it right? And I was like, oh, shit like they need like, and and10500:17:31.300 --> 00:17:45.889The Alliance: when I tried to build it for the Alliance one I was like, Well, fuck, how do you train AI, if you don't know what level, if everybody's at a different starting point, and I'm not the world's leading expert at it, I maybe shouldn't do this right. So, which is what? Back me out of it.10600:17:45.890 --> 00:18:02.800The Alliance: But I was looking at it, and what I was wondering was exactly what you're talking about, which is like, why isn't there a single? Why do I have to call 400 of my friends to try to figure out how to do one like Comp. One thing like there should be one stop shopping. So I like this, okay, keep going.10700:18:03.700 --> 00:18:10.819Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes. So that is that is kind of the big the big story in the in the big idea, where a lot of things10800:18:11.517 --> 00:18:23.490Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: personal personal goals, and and professional overlap. Now, more on the personal level. I think my10900:18:24.673 --> 00:18:29.110Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: illness, if you will, and something I. I am kind of11000:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.559Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: trying to work through it, and it becomes more and more critical.11100:18:34.915 --> 00:18:40.589Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Within this setup is consistency. And basically11200:18:40.960 --> 00:18:51.310Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I have a lot of ideas. A lot of them are cool. I'm sort of 5, 5, 7, 7 different things in place, but when then it comes to execution.11300:18:51.550 --> 00:19:01.040Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know it. It is complicated for me to push things through and and to some degree. It's com complicated for me to11400:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.719Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of energize others to to push through.11500:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.838Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: if you know if you know what I mean. And previously I had, you know, 5, 6 people working for me directly.11600:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.140Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: another 50 working for me indirectly.11700:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I11800:19:21.310 --> 00:19:35.109Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I could have a meeting, and I know that this is as much time as needed for me to kind of accomplish something, because the end of the meeting I'm just saying, Okay, you guys take it from here and I can. I can11900:19:35.310 --> 00:19:44.600Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: count on them to at least keep up the pace, and, you know, come back with the problem in 2 days, or with the solution in 2 days, and stuff like that here when when I'm like12000:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.850Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of just 3 of us.12100:19:47.190 --> 00:19:56.870Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I have 3 days when it's super super productive, super active, and all of that. And I have a zillion of ideas. I write all of that down, and then there's like 4 days to12200:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.349Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of nothing happens. And that's the12300:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.525Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that's a big issue for me personally in terms of performance.12400:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.796Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and I think the 3, rd which is sort of12500:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.049Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: does overlap with the previous 2.12600:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And I.12700:20:27.600 --> 00:20:38.329Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So I lack somehow, and I don't. I don't think it's even. It's even even the kind of flow alliance question. But just to bring it bring it forward.12800:20:40.090 --> 00:20:48.390Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm having a little bit of a problem, generating kind of systematic new connections12900:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.469Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: in terms of people and in terms of network.13000:20:53.390 --> 00:20:59.950Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: in the sense that in the sense that every now and then I would meet new people, become friends with them, and etc, etc. But13100:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.940Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I see a lot of I look at a lot of other13200:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.429Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: folks, and I see that they are like much more13300:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.270Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: again, consistent on that right. And13400:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.070Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that's a bit of a thing I'm I'm partly make trying to13500:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.539Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: solve with with this solution, right? Because it kind of rigs13600:21:26.025 --> 00:21:34.204Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: systematic outreach and systematic reason to to kind of get exposed to new, to new things and to new, to new people.13700:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.050Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: again. Maybe it's not. It's not.13800:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.791The Alliance: So. No, no, so one.13900:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.100The Alliance: Let's go in reverse order.14000:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.770Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I think.14100:21:43.770 --> 00:21:49.259The Alliance: Oh, I think that's exactly one of the problems I was trying to solve with the Alliance.14200:21:49.430 --> 00:22:02.290The Alliance: right, both for myself and for others like when I was running the flow research collective. I didn't have to network because Rian was networking right? I had a CEO, and he loved to network, and it was great14300:22:02.740 --> 00:22:23.930The Alliance: but one I don't like. We we parted ways that, and like I was like, Oh, should I have to do this? And 2 I like, I'm not a good networker. I don't. I? I'm a good. Once I get make relationships, I'm actually a really loyal friend, and we'll be like, and and but I don't know how to do it14400:22:23.980 --> 00:22:34.779The Alliance: at the superficial level. I never have been able to do it, so I had to build a container that would establish sort of deeper relationships that way. And my hope is that14500:22:35.270 --> 00:22:45.570The Alliance: we only we like everybody in the you know you. Everybody sort of like we meet each other, and we have access to each other's networks a little bit. I'm hoping that emerges out of it so like I think that14600:22:45.910 --> 00:22:51.595The Alliance: I don't think you're alone in that. I think that's going on. I noticed it, too, and14700:22:52.380 --> 00:23:13.828The Alliance: you know, and I also think I got to a certain point where I was like holy fuck. Everybody I know and like and love works for me, or wants to work for me. You know I like I was like, this is no good, like, literally like everybody who likes me. They're all on my payroll, and that's not exactly clean. It's the way it's worked out. But like, you know, so I see that that I wanna14800:23:14.470 --> 00:23:42.150The Alliance: I wanted to go back to the this, what you said a second ago and drill down on 2 things. So one, let's talk about the up and down of the of productivity, because in my experience, what it sounds like you're describing. And maybe I'm wrong. Is that sounds like the flow cycle, Bra, like I was really in the Zone for a couple of days, especially like, if you're talking about heightened creativity and idea generation, we know a deep flow state of last14900:23:42.350 --> 00:24:04.629The Alliance: the day, but that heightened creativity will stick around for a day, maybe 2. This is Teresa's work at Harvard. So it sounds like, and it sounds like when it's round. You are really taking advantage of it, and then there's a deep crash afterwards, and I will tell you that. Remember, when I talked about peak exits like quitting when you're most excited.15000:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.380The Alliance: that will prevent those multi day burnout sessions.15100:24:09.600 --> 00:24:21.109The Alliance: So the when you ride the dopamine high and the flow high all the way to the bitter end, you've literally sort of removed all the neurochemistry from the brain. And you're essentially burned out.15200:24:21.210 --> 00:24:40.190The Alliance: So you have to like, it's gonna that's gonna have a natural reset session. And if you beat yourself up during the reset session, which is what you're doing, sounds like you're frustrated with yourself. I know this. So this is really fucking common with professional athletes. Actually, this takes out professional athletes right and left.15300:24:40.486 --> 00:24:56.499The Alliance: They don't understand that there's this natural ebb and flow, and so they're not. There's not enough recovery in between. They ride the you know they ride those dopamine highs to the bitter end. What I will tell you to do try a couple of things I'll give you like. So I have15400:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.520The Alliance: handful of like15500:24:59.770 --> 00:25:10.659The Alliance: by fillers or movies that I want to watch like literally things that are meant to pull me out of flow. So when I've had, when my thoughts are really they're still going, but the quality is dipped a little bit.15600:25:10.780 --> 00:25:38.340The Alliance: I will. I try to walk away and break myself out of flow. I literally do flow, blocking things like television, or read like a thriller, but like literally to knock myself out of flow, otherwise I'll ride it to the bitter end. And then there's this too long of a hangover for me. I don't mind if it's overnight, and I sleep, and I'm refreshed, or maybe you know what I mean. But like I couldn't. The long ones were, were, and they're and they're too unpredictable for me. So15700:25:38.900 --> 00:25:45.860The Alliance: that might be like peak exits and just shortening it a little bit, because you'll get more over time.15800:25:46.000 --> 00:26:06.370The Alliance: And if you do burn yourself out. This is that emotional hangover rule I talked about. You can't beat yourself up for it. You just have to. That is literally like, you're not doing anything wrong. That's how the biology works. So what I what I you know in those recovery periods your job is literally recharge the batteries.15900:26:06.370 --> 00:26:16.810The Alliance: So you have to do the exact opposite of beating yourself up. That might help there. A little bit. And the I wanna drill down into. Does that make sense? By the way, let me stop there. Does that make sense?16000:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.889The Alliance: No, no.16100:26:18.030 --> 00:26:22.947Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, it it does. It makes makes perfect sense.16200:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.140The Alliance: See how to operationalize it. Keep going.16300:26:27.049 --> 00:26:31.540Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: The issue. The issue I I would have is usually16400:26:32.060 --> 00:26:39.774Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like the the issue for me is over the weekend. So kind of one of my goals for the years I've out of.16500:26:40.970 --> 00:27:07.810Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I I think I had 4 4 categories looking for big big ones. So out of the 4 i i called one made Monday is great again, because usually Monday for me is is the worst. It's like Friday, Thursday, Friday. I am like at my best. Everything happens. Everything's amazing, all of that stuff. Then I might work on a i i end Friday. There's something a little bit left. I said, okay, I'll work a little bit on Saturday work on Saturday.16600:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.279Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: then Sunday kind of nothing happens, and they start Monday, and it's just like getting into this16700:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: completely, completely heavy, heavy.16800:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.619Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: heavy stuff. So I was like systematically thinking how to make Monday. Not a lost day to me.16900:27:26.111 --> 00:27:31.800Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And, by the way, today was the Monday, the best one that I had in like months.17000:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.540Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So I'm cool.17100:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah. So one on 1 117200:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.610The Alliance: Is that because I would. So17300:27:44.090 --> 00:28:00.209The Alliance: if you're not getting into flow over the weekend like, if you're not doubling down on your primary flow activity, whatever that is, over the weekend that can make Mondays really difficult, because you haven't reminded yourself why you love being alive. You've just17400:28:00.240 --> 00:28:15.800The Alliance: sort of push projects forward. I by the way, I'm suffering from that, like I worked on the new book all weekend because it's fucking, do. And I was just like. Don't go skiing. You went skiing last week at the Alliance just, and sure enough, today I woke up and I was like, I've got no reserves17500:28:15.870 --> 00:28:27.100The Alliance: like I like. I just work straight through and but last week you had a big flow. Experience with the Alliance. Was that, did that help? Is that like was that the reboot.17600:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.239Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I think I think I think that17700:28:31.520 --> 00:28:38.270Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that definitely help. Yeah, that definitely help that definitely was part part of the thing. And17800:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.079Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I was just also kind of17900:28:43.540 --> 00:28:51.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it was a mix of. I had a lot of kind of small things which we also the the weekend before I got to18000:28:51.494 --> 00:29:08.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I got to. California was a long weekend here in Europe. So I've actually came from like 2 day travel elsewhere. So there was like a lot of travel, a lot of stuff with small things which were kind of, and I was a little bit almost like panicking. There's so much things outstanding18100:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and18200:29:10.710 --> 00:29:27.806Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of getting all of those things properly planned properly together, so I could feed them all in the day, and I can spend the day very productively got all the all the stuff left and right, and then I was until until sometime last year18300:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.100Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: talking to a18400:29:31.510 --> 00:29:41.071Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: met a cognitive therapist. I kind of stopped. I stopped doing that, but I I was in the in the session in sessions with him, and his advice has been.18500:29:41.510 --> 00:29:54.469Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and make sure that the 1st thing you you do on Monday straight to get yourself into into flow like in in the morning, just, you know, don't do the planning for the week. Don't do no nonsense, just, you know. Start with18600:29:54.620 --> 00:30:01.410Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: an hour and a half like, read the book, and and spend an hour and a half on like doing something deep and meaningful.18700:30:02.272 --> 00:30:23.930Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Because part of the part of part of sort of the problem with Mondays it's sort of coming yet. It's kind of steal from the more of a corporate setup is that Monday starts. Nothing happens all Monday. Everyone just runs around plans for plans the week ahead. It's like nothing. Nothing gets done. Everyone's like this planning meeting, that planning meeting, that planning meeting, that planning meeting like the end is done.18800:30:24.150 --> 00:30:40.829Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and you're just frustrated about all the stuff which is sort of outstanding. So I said, try to do, try to do the opposite. Try to do kind of one big sort of meaningful thing in the beginning of of it all. And that's that that started to help. Yeah.18900:30:41.500 --> 00:30:51.329The Alliance: Oh, I can see that that's great advice that makes total sense. Well, so what do you? So you've got? You're starting your week with a a deep work. It's all. It's why I always19000:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.449The Alliance: to start each day by writing.19100:30:54.180 --> 00:31:03.439The Alliance: It's i 1. i'm advancing my cause, but it's really about dropping myself into flow, so I can manage all the chaos that's coming next.19200:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.300The Alliance: But.19300:31:05.460 --> 00:31:11.670Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And then it's also like 2 or 2 h in the working day. You know my my daughter is just waking up, and I'm already like done.19400:31:11.870 --> 00:31:12.260The Alliance: It's.19500:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.829Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: An important piece of work like, if nothing else happens that day, I'm already like good. Then.19600:31:16.830 --> 00:31:24.119The Alliance: Yeah, that's I mean, that's I. Yeah. First, st I I try to. I I like to have won my day before 9 am.19700:31:24.230 --> 00:31:40.120The Alliance: Like when everybody else sits down at work. I like to have one my day already, so I've already got like I've got an hour, an entire second day of work ahead of me that like means I get to be, you know, 8 h ahead of everybody. Let me ask you about the completion stuff for a second19800:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.720The Alliance: is this a19900:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.959The Alliance: dunking goal setting problem? Meaning like, you have the big dream. But you can't get it to action steps. So you don't.20000:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.359The Alliance: No, or you just stop taking the steps because you get bored.20100:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.900Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I think there is a combination of 2 things.20200:32:04.750 --> 00:32:11.390Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like a lot of a lot of the times I'm I'm doing things.20300:32:11.540 --> 00:32:16.179Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I struggle to set up a clear structure ahead of the time.20400:32:16.450 --> 00:32:22.609Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So I'll go and say, Okay, I'll do a presentation. The presentation is gonna have 4 sections. The section.20500:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.789Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the 1st section I would spend20600:32:25.090 --> 00:32:32.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: outline, quite detail. The second section is in less detail, and the last 2 I wouldn't and say, Okay, I'll just start, and then I'll see how it goes. And then20700:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 2 thirds in.20800:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.320The Alliance: There we go!20900:32:35.320 --> 00:32:41.875Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I was like, okay, I need to review. I need to redo. I need to review. And all that stuff. That's 1 part second part is really dispersion.21000:32:42.350 --> 00:32:49.309Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: because and that's a legacy thing. I just have21100:32:49.700 --> 00:32:57.930Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: too many small things going going in each in each given time. So go getting on the thing which I know would take me21200:32:58.100 --> 00:33:08.250Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like a month working straight. But because I'm dealing with 4 of those things at the same or 5 of those things that's like half a year right? And by the time21300:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.440Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you get to the end to the end of this half a year21400:33:12.456 --> 00:33:18.013Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: by spending like an hour and a half each day on that, on that, on the thing.21500:33:19.920 --> 00:33:35.622Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, things change into to a large degree. The situation has changed etc, etc, etc, and some people are very good jumping from one to another, and having like energy to switch, and all of that for me. That switch is extremely painful.21600:33:36.960 --> 00:33:42.670Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: just like completely energy draining.21700:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.020The Alliance: So21800:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.030The Alliance: let's take them one at a time when you start a project on in terms of.21900:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.210The Alliance: But22000:33:57.980 --> 00:34:05.110The Alliance: the 1st section gets really detailed, and the last section does right? So the structure gets wonky. Have you22100:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.020The Alliance: considered?22200:34:11.739 --> 00:34:21.610The Alliance: Maybe starting with the ending like mapping out your starts and your endings 1st and then filling in the middle. So you avoid. So you actually know where you're going.22300:34:21.610 --> 00:34:41.819The Alliance: The reason I mentioned this is the brain's a goal directed system. So if you give it a destination, if you give it an ending, this is the start. This is the ending. It's really good at filling in the middle. It's really good at its pattern recognition system. You know how it works. It'll fill in the middle, but if you don't give it the ending right. If you don't establish boundary conditions, the brain flounders22400:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.545The Alliance: and22500:34:45.510 --> 00:35:13.690The Alliance: which can one of the reasons it you sort of run out of steam because you're not quite sure where you're going, so you don't gain momentum. Right? This is a foundational problem in writer's block writer's block is always or not always okay. There are a couple other varieties, but 90% of the time. And, by the way, writer's block is another fancy way of saying, I've got this big long project. I know where it starts.22600:35:13.930 --> 00:35:26.500The Alliance: I don't know where it ends. That's like it's just a book, right like they call it Writer's block. But it's really just like, Hey, dude! You don't know where you're starting. You don't know where you're ending, so your brain can't do what it is designed to do.22700:35:26.820 --> 00:35:35.710The Alliance: So one suggestion for the next month might be with all the projects. Make sure you have very clear endings.22800:35:36.030 --> 00:35:43.760The Alliance: Make sure you make like articulate the endings, perhaps, does that even make sense in terms of what's what you're up against? Would that work.22900:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.666Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes, yes,23000:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.050Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And and basically, I would have to say that23100:35:52.880 --> 00:36:11.939Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 1 1 of the reasons one of the issues I have is that the past, maybe 5 years I have been working on everything which is absolutely ad hoc. So everything is a creative process. Everything is is is kind of you're coming up with new stuff, new structure for every every everything. I remember when23200:36:13.170 --> 00:36:20.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I was in the more structured setup. Basically, we always knew the ending. So we we know that if you're working on a product, we all23300:36:21.210 --> 00:36:28.500Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: which is supposed to be, you know, this piece of financial analysis or or whatnot like, you know how the end product is. Gonna look so.23400:36:28.810 --> 00:36:29.520The Alliance: Right.23500:36:29.520 --> 00:36:39.249Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Getting. There was just kind of much, much easier over here. 70% of the time you spend to figure out figuring out. So23600:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.709Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that that is a.23700:36:42.530 --> 00:36:47.339The Alliance: And Anatoly. One other thing you wanna you might want to add to it also is because you and I23800:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.540The Alliance: oh.23900:36:50.360 --> 00:37:02.500The Alliance: we. We tend to work on huge projects that could span really long time horizons. I always try to think in terms of like when I articulate endings. If I can't get to the ending I need. I'm like, well, okay.24000:37:02.500 --> 00:37:23.889The Alliance: anything past a 2 year time. Horizon doesn't make any sense from a strategic planning perspective in the age of exponentials. And AI. So sometimes I'm just like, where do I need to be? What's 6 months? What's a year? What's 18? What's 2? And I'm gonna call that. And that's my win, right like that that sometimes that's enough24100:37:24.446 --> 00:37:26.430The Alliance: to really start accelerating.24200:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.179Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, I will.24300:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.650Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That will get get more of that into.24400:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.992The Alliance: Yeah, I'm curious. If that I I like, I think that's 1. Let me ask you the second, the really obvious question.24500:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.210The Alliance: It sounds like you got a24600:37:51.880 --> 00:38:21.010The Alliance: so this is what it sounds like. You tell me if I'm wrong. It sounds like you were an entrepreneur. Had a ton of success, and then you got your butt kicked, and on the backside of that you're still in that scatter mode where you're just like launching shit to see what's next. And now that you've started to finalize, you've still got all that other stuff that you launched because you didn't know exactly what which way with next. And it's still right. I know this exact problem. I'm sort of like. When I shut down the Flow Research collective.24700:38:21.590 --> 00:38:28.150The Alliance: I said we didn't know what it was going to take to sell the alliance. So I booked all this shit over the next 2 to 3 months.24800:38:28.380 --> 00:38:49.069The Alliance: just on the off chance, because I might have to go do all this stuff to and like. No, we've worked completely sold out for the next year, and probably going to be sold out for the next year and a half in like a week, or something like that. None of it. But I still have to do all this shit, and it's killing me. I'm fucking, dying. I'm so I'm like, I'm so mad at myself. So I know exactly where you're at.24900:38:51.490 --> 00:39:01.010The Alliance: Yeah, I'm totally there. So my question to you is the question I've asked you guys like I drew a long line to the sand. I was like, all right. I'm gonna ride it out till June25000:39:01.340 --> 00:39:21.789The Alliance: 18, th and then everything. After that I'm I'm removing because I don't like. It's no longer net, so I I sort of cut it off at a certain point. But is there a way for you to 80 20? It can you get out of some of those projects, or can you see them through quickly? Like, is there a way to say, Okay, I'm gonna take a month and put 3 things to bed.25100:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.200Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Cool.25200:39:27.250 --> 00:39:33.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I mean, there is a degree of that happening. And and basically, I am now on A, on a, on a, on a25300:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.983Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: definite definite on the, on the back burner. The25400:39:40.610 --> 00:39:47.089Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kinda obvious problem is that it can still base. Very well. And25500:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.509Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: on the other hand, I'm just starting a new business which25600:39:50.780 --> 00:39:58.839Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know. God knows how much you're gonna take until it's properly income producing. So getting myself in the middle of that25700:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.690Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: is also not.25800:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.236Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, not a good idea to get to get stuck where one is already done and the other one is not happening.25900:40:07.640 --> 00:40:14.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hmm, and they in terms of time. I kind of got to a point where26000:40:15.140 --> 00:40:22.359Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: time wise it is. 1 1 day a week. It is 1 1 day a week. But26100:40:22.560 --> 00:40:37.077Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the issue is that it's very emotional, loaded one day a week, because it kind of has all those things which were kind of went wrong in the past 2, 3 years, including some kind of complicated relationships.26200:40:39.690 --> 00:40:49.930Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I think I think this this one. They're the only the only problem, the only solution here is just to wait until the natural end, which is, you know, another 6 months.26300:40:51.190 --> 00:40:58.320The Alliance: Alright. So then it sounds like but it but it does sound like unless you talk bum26400:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.510The Alliance: when you, at the end of that emotionally charged day.26500:41:04.430 --> 00:41:11.559The Alliance: it sounds like you need a buffer at both ends of it, like a mindfulness, session, or something, because26600:41:12.110 --> 00:41:25.379The Alliance: right? Cause like I know what that's like, where you're like. Oh, fuck! I've got a day full of conversations with people that maybe I sort of want to talk to, but it's they're all heavy. They all weigh more than they should at this point. And I know what those days are like.26700:41:25.570 --> 00:41:35.859The Alliance: I. This is one of the reasons I taught you guys, Vipassana, I don't know how much you've played with the Vipassana system, but the thing that I fucking love about Vipassana, and I've never26800:41:36.070 --> 00:41:46.369The Alliance: had this experience with any other meditation system is, it doesn't actually matter anymore what my day throws at me, because I I know I can use26900:41:46.480 --> 00:41:53.659The Alliance: the pasta, and in 20 min, 15 to 20 min, I actually can get my brain back. I've never had a meditation27000:41:53.860 --> 00:42:03.199The Alliance: technique that work that well, but this for the particular system that works super well for me, which is why I was like wanted you guys to learn, because I was like holy crap.27100:42:03.410 --> 00:42:21.819The Alliance: like, I like this deep empowerment of like look what I can do at the end of my day to reset my brain, which is, you know, especially, I think if you're launching a business mandatory, because otherwise you can't like. I don't know how you get through a week. I don't know how I did it before I had tools like this. I'm not sure.27200:42:23.310 --> 00:42:33.080Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah. And then the more complicated thing is is when you when you go to sleep, and you know you carry that through the night, and you wake up with the same shit in the in the app. It's it's completely.27300:42:33.330 --> 00:42:50.429The Alliance: Oh, dude, if you if you make it, if I make it through the night, it's the 2 am. Wake up! Call that I, fucking hate right? It's like all the all the things I didn't. All the things that are going wrong that I didn't see during the day rear their head at 2 o'clock in the morning, like, Hey, dude, pay attention to these 17 things, and then, yeah.27400:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.400Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, exactly that.27500:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.559The Alliance: I know. I know that I know that one.27600:42:55.090 --> 00:42:59.310The Alliance: It's a 1 of the things that27700:42:59.850 --> 00:43:05.900The Alliance: do you? When do you make clear goals lists. Have you? Have you been doing that mute.27800:43:07.330 --> 00:43:14.650Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: no? Well, I would say, no, no! Is the wrong answer. Not not always, I would say half and half27900:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.570Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I understand the importance.28000:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.720Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I guess I need training.28100:43:22.080 --> 00:43:29.649The Alliance: Oh, well, let me talk to you about why I like I I want. I think you might get a lot more benefit out of that particular one.28200:43:30.420 --> 00:43:40.240The Alliance: If you make a clear goals list, and you actually like, make it by hand and cross everything off by hand every day. The big deal, at least for me in the beginning, when I was playing with this.28300:43:40.680 --> 00:43:50.710The Alliance: Yeah, it produced workflow. Yeah, it did all those things. It did it like it works as advertised. The big deal was it told by brain when it was allowed to shut off at the end of the day.28400:43:51.100 --> 00:44:06.179The Alliance: when I got through the last item of my clear goals list. It was time for my brain to shut off, so I didn't have that pairing the problems into the next day my brain was like, Oh, this is the off time. This is when I put it down, and it really seemed to help.28500:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.390Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.28600:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.430Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: The28700:44:10.890 --> 00:44:14.499The Alliance: I'd be interested to see what would happen if, like for the next month28800:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.390The Alliance: we would. We really may, if you are articulating your endings.28900:44:19.800 --> 00:44:30.710The Alliance: really leaning into a clear goals list and focusing on on peak exits to not burn yourself out. Just those 3 tools might be the place to start29000:44:34.430 --> 00:44:55.959The Alliance: also because I I like, you know. I think if I give you more than 3 things to think about that's stupid, right? Like that's not like. Then you're fucked. But, like, you know, clear goals list and I the other thing I would say, cause you met. This may be really helpful for you. I find this is really helpful for me. I make the clear goals list for them tomorrow at the end of today.29100:44:56.010 --> 00:45:13.244The Alliance: So I finish my old goals list. And then I, because what it allows me to do is offload all the scheduling right? And when I'm really working on it, I will tell myself very specifically like this is the task I need to write a thousand words in my book. Right and29200:45:14.090 --> 00:45:43.630The Alliance: I'll I'll get very like I want my reader to feel XY. And Z. I'll get as I possibly possibly can with it, and like, let myself like, let tell myself how like this is the ending like right until here. Just so, I know this is the ending kind of thing. Because otherwise my brain, there's a the thing you were talking about, which is task switching. If I don't give myself an ending inside the clear goals list that I know, like, okay, this is done. My brain has a really hard time task switching.29300:45:44.910 --> 00:46:02.559The Alliance: and it there's extra cost there, which is also why those create the creativity microdosing in between deep work sessions but lowers the cost of tasks, which, because it's kind of a fun thing, and it's for resets the brain. So there's not as much drag going to the next thing.29400:46:06.220 --> 00:46:15.680Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Speaking of of creativity on the 3rd month we are supposed to do something of our own.29500:46:16.490 --> 00:46:33.930The Alliance: No, the group flow is 3, rd month is group, flow, and collaboration. 4th month is is mastery in terms of creativity. Microdosing. What we've got is month. One is drawing month. 2 is writing month. 3 is movement and29600:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.770The Alliance: month 4 is sort of a choose your own adventure based29700:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.470The Alliance: combination. Yeah, I didn't wanna like one.29800:46:44.090 --> 00:46:48.330The Alliance: I didn't. Wanna some people are gonna react really? Well to the movement stuff.29900:46:48.450 --> 00:47:17.049The Alliance: Some people are going to be like, fuck you codlar, what are you doing? Why are you making me do that like, I know, like somebody's gonna have a reaction, at least one of them, which is fine like. I don't mind being uncomfortable. I don't mind making people uncomfortable. It's stretching the brain. I'm fine with it, but I don't want people to have to get locked into something they hate right for the last month, and I want them to like, really start using it as a daily practice. I mean, think about like learning to draw any of these creativity exercises is30000:47:17.280 --> 00:47:45.569The Alliance: we're doing them 1520 min of time. But I can draw for 2 min between tasks. And it really is a fast task. So you know, that's a that's a tool down the road so that it's a choose. Your own adventure based on like what you learned about yourself along the way. Basically and I'm sure as I see what people are learning, I'll put a little more structure around it. I just didn't want to like lock it in until I see what's happening with you guys.30100:47:45.960 --> 00:47:55.289Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, yeah. And I think it makes perfect sense. I I see there are a few kind of open, open questions to see kind of how it goes into to develop the program as it as it goes.30200:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.380The Alliance: Oh, my God! By the way, I will never do that route of a data dump30300:48:00.740 --> 00:48:20.911The Alliance: all at once again. You know what I mean we'll next time it's gonna start the night before, and then it'll go in right, and it'll spread out over like a full like day that like I was like, Oh, I can't do that to people again. And and it was just too much like I. Most people were like, What do I do next, and that's fine.30400:48:22.254 --> 00:48:36.670The Alliance: I that's what these calls are for, and I'm I'm cool with. I don't mind that. I don't mind like when your brain gets a lot to chew on, but I think it was a little too much. I think I need to dial it back from like it was at 100. It's gotta go to like 75.30500:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.350Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: When I when when I got back to when I got back to London, I was like30600:48:42.710 --> 00:48:48.716Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: holy shit. All of that happened in a day. It was like a week full of.30700:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.749Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I liked it well, I so.30800:48:52.340 --> 00:48:57.030The Alliance: Like those days. IA friend of mine, has a theory that30900:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.310The Alliance: when you and this is decided31000:48:59.440 --> 00:49:21.549The Alliance: floats with jives up with neuroscientists that like, if you have those like time, dilated days where time slows down to speeds up the really flowy days where there's so much those are actually the those become memories. That's what forms memories. And so when you look back on your year, if you have a lot of those days, your brain actually treats the whole year as meaningful31100:49:22.250 --> 00:49:31.640The Alliance: because it had a lot of those rich days. So I like, I like facilitating that. I think that's cool, cause it, you know, you look back. And you're like, Oh, I did this, really, you know.31200:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.309The Alliance: I thought it was a great group. I was really excited. I think we're gonna have a great.31300:49:37.310 --> 00:49:38.359Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It was really exciting.31400:49:38.360 --> 00:49:38.780The Alliance: Fun.31500:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.059Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Sure it was. It was fascinating.31600:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.818The Alliance: All right. What else? What else31700:49:46.051 --> 00:49:51.890The Alliance: rapid fire? We got like 15 min. So what else can I sort of help you think about it all?31800:49:53.530 --> 00:49:59.540The Alliance: Does this feel like a decent plan, like focusing on peak exits clear goals and a little more.31900:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It does.32000:50:06.830 --> 00:50:12.410Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: definitely, you know, sounds like the the plan to work around the32100:50:13.324 --> 00:50:22.849Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the second item, which is which is more on the personal level, the consistency, and all that. Any any thoughts on32200:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.800Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: how I could reinforce or advance32300:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.200Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the the 1st topic which is which is32400:50:37.390 --> 00:50:40.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: spreading, spreading loss, so to say.32500:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: or how I could spend the next 4 months.32600:50:45.810 --> 00:50:50.899Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: In a way which would help me build that in the in the future.32700:50:52.220 --> 00:50:58.920The Alliance: So, for I mean you, you you obviously have been doing this for for a very long.32800:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.240The Alliance: I mean, it's it strikes me like so32900:51:05.060 --> 00:51:13.669The Alliance: the idea of by purchasing or partnering with medium sized legacy organizations to up to do a top to bottom upgrade33000:51:13.960 --> 00:51:20.930The Alliance: Don's cool, and if you've got the capital in your partners to do it. That sounds really interesting.33100:51:22.630 --> 00:51:25.690The Alliance: I when I look at something like that, I think.33200:51:26.010 --> 00:51:47.680The Alliance: wow! You better have really tight systems for all the things that you want to revolutionize. Right? So like, if you're gonna bring, everybody is going to be different. But like, I wanna like, what are the like? What's the upgrade menu? Are are there 5 or 6? How many processes are really talking about? And then, like the next level, I want to know is.33300:51:47.730 --> 00:52:03.910The Alliance: what does it take like? What does it actually take that to see through to completion? Are you gonna give each company their own performance coach. You know what I like all that like I I start asking myself all the questions about scale, like.33400:52:04.110 --> 00:52:10.940The Alliance: I see, you know this is different than just being a a venture fund where you're33500:52:11.380 --> 00:52:24.029The Alliance: helping all the companies along, you're actually rebuilding the entire companies. That sounds like a heavy lift. Who's the team. Not with 3 guys like that's I don't so like.33600:52:24.030 --> 00:52:30.250Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No, the the idea is. And and this comes from my can. My own business was built around33700:52:30.440 --> 00:52:37.590Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: basically digital what's called digital transformation. Right, and I came. I was not the CEO.33800:52:37.938 --> 00:52:41.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I was an investor, but I was sort of pushed into a CEO role.33900:52:41.510 --> 00:53:08.790Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And my realization. You know I was trying to do digital transformation and construction, which is probably one of the most fucked up industries out there, because it's just the way it's structured today in the world is that it's a complete 0 sum game, and everyone hates everyone and everything turns into shit show really quickly. And my realization has been that, you know, unless there is a really committed CEO.34000:53:09.158 --> 00:53:15.719Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Because I've tried to bring. I was doing things myself, and then I tried to bring other people's work to replace me.34100:53:15.850 --> 00:53:37.770Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: None of them got it. And unless you're really committed, all of that just goes to waste. So it really has to be an agenda of the number one guy and that really has to exactly what you said. Really tight system. So it's like, this is the only way you can do things, and there is real monitoring of whether things work or not. So I see it. As34200:53:37.900 --> 00:53:44.029Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: there is the leader. The leader gets training which takes 3, 4, 6 months.34300:53:44.510 --> 00:53:52.210Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and the leader then, is in charge of implementing that with the team, and from us he gets34400:53:52.979 --> 00:54:08.079Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: support on a coaching be standard a menu of standard technical solutions which could be implemented by us in the Portfolio Company on consulting basis.34500:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.770Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But we're not running those companies. The companies continue to be ran by this incoming CEO,34600:54:14.320 --> 00:54:22.700Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: who is either the number 2 guy in the business, or someone or someone new but he is.34700:54:22.820 --> 00:54:29.639Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It's I've read. I've read this book, you probably or not read, I finishing it.34800:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.900Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Sorry.34900:54:34.690 --> 00:54:35.960The Alliance: Inflow, right.35000:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.969Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Team flow. The psychology of optimal collaboration.35100:54:39.970 --> 00:54:55.280The Alliance: Yeah, that's I. I recognize it. Boom! It was blurry. But I recognize it. Yeah, I was so one of the things I was I was. I'm glad you're reading that because I was gonna suggest it because one of the things when you're talking about the difficulties you're having with collaboration and sustaining it.35200:54:55.500 --> 00:55:08.839The Alliance: That is usually about collective ambition, right? Which is the foundation of of team flow. It's usually a a misalignment collective ambition problem, because if you get every selfish motives lined up.35300:55:09.080 --> 00:55:23.609The Alliance: then it usually the problem usually starts to take care of itself. But if there's misalignment about like people's individual, selfish motives that gets tricky. It also gets tricky when you have different definitions of what work is.35400:55:23.910 --> 00:55:30.669The Alliance: you know, in terms of partners. I think everybody, I think if you're building companies, you, everybody has to work at the same speed. Otherwise it doesn't work.35500:55:31.330 --> 00:55:32.080The Alliance: Boom.35600:55:32.570 --> 00:55:37.660Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, he here listen. We're already buying companies which have been which have been35700:55:38.020 --> 00:55:59.739Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: successful in their own merit. Right? So they at least know their basic right. They know they know the core thing they're doing right. It's not like we are teaching them from scratch. They've been doing it already. For 5, 6, 7 years they've been making money. So we can say that unless we really rock the ship, whatever we bring is supposed to be accretive35800:56:01.300 --> 00:56:15.179The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, it sounds it sounds it sounds dope. I wonder? I mean what I again, it's I, I wonder, about the size of the implementation teams and things like that and the level of expertise you're gonna need there. But it doesn't sound35900:56:15.870 --> 00:56:23.290The Alliance: undoable at all. You know what I mean, like I, this just seems like a a money manpower problem, not a36000:56:23.530 --> 00:56:25.280The Alliance: impossible dream.36100:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.930The Alliance: The model seems okay.36200:56:30.670 --> 00:56:31.440Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay.36300:56:32.100 --> 00:56:38.280The Alliance: I like, where you've been buying companies. How many of you? How many you guys have at this point.36400:56:38.760 --> 00:56:49.060Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So we we have 0. We are kind of in the process. We started in January. So we're we're just approaching. Let's say, our 1st acquisition in the next couple of months. So we've been36500:56:49.350 --> 00:57:10.779Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: together with looking for deals. We've been putting all of the strategy together because it all started with, you know. We'll buy companies, and we'll do great things to them. But the great things is a lot of details, and that that took time to thought through and put down on paper. And also prepare that for capital raising, which is pretty much where we are kind of today.36600:57:10.920 --> 00:57:18.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So 1st year until end of the year. I plan to buy one, maybe 2,36700:57:18.400 --> 00:57:27.100Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: at most 3, but most likely not more than 2, and raise some capital in addition to to what we we kind of contributed as partners.36800:57:28.670 --> 00:57:31.013Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So just started slow36900:57:33.190 --> 00:57:39.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: to really think what should be our proprietary products, we really think what should be those tight systems.37000:57:39.630 --> 00:57:50.760Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and how to think about performance coaching, that is all. On my agenda.37100:57:56.210 --> 00:58:00.350The Alliance: The performance. Coaching aspect is is interesting. That's a37200:58:01.990 --> 00:58:11.855The Alliance: in a sense, that's a systems choice. You gotta figure out like, you know what I mean, like, what? What do you actually want to bring in? Is it a flow based system, is it, you know? Is those kinds of questions?37300:58:15.570 --> 00:58:19.739The Alliance: the other stuff. It seems like it's I mean it. It's37400:58:23.110 --> 00:58:31.310The Alliance: it seems like you've got a toolkit and an idea. And you're not gonna know, like one of the things that's interesting is.37500:58:31.620 --> 00:58:41.879The Alliance: you sort of have to get the product far enough along. And this might be the goal for the 4 months to like that by the time you have this 1st company.37600:58:42.650 --> 00:58:43.040Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, they.37700:58:43.040 --> 00:58:49.210The Alliance: Like you, you know exactly what you're doing. And most important, and I think this has just got to be the truth.37800:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.200The Alliance: You you know37900:58:51.410 --> 00:59:03.270The Alliance: how you're gonna learn from all the stuff you're gonna do wrong, right? Like that. You want a data capture system that that records failures and successes.38000:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.679The Alliance: Because the learning curve is gonna be38100:59:08.910 --> 00:59:20.409The Alliance: really steep. Right? There's certain elements of digital transformation that you're excellent at right clearly. And those are on your thing, and then they're just going to be the gaps. And then it's really like the question of like.38200:59:20.570 --> 00:59:36.189The Alliance: the coaching is interesting because you gotta ask like you, we one. It may be an individual thing like, do they actually need performance coaching? Do they really need tech coaching for all the new systems that you put in right and like those. So those are. Those are38300:59:36.600 --> 00:59:45.550The Alliance: Dbd questions. I think I don't think you know those answers. I just like I would what I would try to do is go in with a38400:59:46.420 --> 01:00:10.700The Alliance: these are the. This is the menu of tech stuff. This is the menu of performance stuff, and have like a solution and or a person at each vector you know what I mean like. So at least you can, you know, see what the situation needs and and go from there. That's how I would sort of think about it, because it seems really blank slate ish until you actually get some companies in the door and start doing it.38501:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.560Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.38601:00:13.220 --> 01:00:28.279The Alliance: Is the interesting. The the truth of the matter is, you're gonna want. You're gonna want a very specialized niche, which is the question you're asking is a really cool question. And it's really like, if I'm trying to essentially modernize a legacy organization.38701:00:28.820 --> 01:00:42.289The Alliance: what are the exact peak performance tools that work? And the answer is going to be, what stage of development are they at? Different tools are gonna work at different times. But I don't know if you're gonna know that yet, does that make it? Does that38801:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.560The Alliance: land.38901:00:43.970 --> 01:00:46.300Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Different stage of development of the company.39001:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.820The Alliance: Well.39101:00:49.950 --> 01:00:50.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Or did.39201:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.340The Alliance: No, I I mean.39301:00:53.130 --> 01:00:58.940The Alliance: Well, 1st of all, it's an ongoing process, right? When you train anybody organization or individual peak performance.39401:01:00.030 --> 01:01:22.474The Alliance: you know, I always start with motivation, because if that's not right, nothing else works right. And and actually, at the Flow Research collective, we discovered that you oftentimes you can't even start with motivation. Every so goddamn burned out that you actually have to start with recovery and burnout so they can get their brains back, and then you can go into motivation.39501:01:23.470 --> 01:01:24.730The Alliance: and39601:01:26.490 --> 01:01:43.939The Alliance: that's just our learning from that. But you're doing a slightly different thing. You've you're doing a digital transformation. So the question is, if our if if we're about a digital transformation, what are the performance coaching tools that need to go along with it and month one.39701:01:44.300 --> 01:02:06.440The Alliance: We're gonna start with burnout month 2, we're gonna move to motivation Month 3. We're like, each of those are gonna sort of coincide with the technological upgrades that you're bringing would be my guess. That's how I would start to think about it. You'd want them married together so that it's a coherent system. That's how I would start to think about it. Does that make any sense to you?39801:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.190Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes, absolutely.39901:02:11.130 --> 01:02:14.599The Alliance: I don't know if that helps you as a as a place to start and thinking through this idea.40001:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No, this is. This is very helpful. Thank you.40101:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.550The Alliance: So40201:02:29.490 --> 01:02:43.169The Alliance: that's sort of, by the way, an extension of like articulating your endings might. It's it's it seems like, what is the what you know, one part of that is about putting together, like the coach, the framework you need to, at least, you know, get started.40301:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.120Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.40401:02:51.040 --> 01:03:01.429Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: thank you. This makes this. This makes a lot of sense. It definitely definitely tools to to move forward.40501:03:01.610 --> 01:03:08.870The Alliance: Yeah. Well, I mean we'll we'll we'll check back in in a I mean, I'll you know. I'll see you between now and then I think I see you40601:03:08.980 --> 01:03:33.450The Alliance: Thursday. For our next digital pop up. But I'd be interested. I'm gonna I'm gonna run these things past Ryan, so hold you accountable to them, and you know that if if you're not accountable, if you try to get out of this he will hunt you down and and kill your whole family. So nothing to worry about. There. We're we've got an interesting enforcement system to see you all the way through.40701:03:33.990 --> 01:03:35.600Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay, amazing. That's.40801:03:36.390 --> 01:03:37.180The Alliance: Amazing.40901:03:37.430 --> 01:03:38.660The Alliance: Isaac.41001:03:40.990 --> 01:03:48.119The Alliance: Alright! This is fun. I want to talk more, Kabbalah. And so at some point soon, I want to hear more about how41101:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.139The Alliance: what you're doing with that that's interesting to me.41201:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.640Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Are you? Are you? Are you familiar with the Kabbalah center?41301:03:57.010 --> 01:03:58.624The Alliance: Oh, the41401:03:59.830 --> 01:04:02.899The Alliance: What's his name? Center the bring the Kabbalah to the people.41501:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.849The Alliance: What the hell was his name?41601:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.070Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Ralph.41701:04:07.070 --> 01:04:09.030The Alliance: One Madonna made famous years ago.41801:04:09.370 --> 01:04:09.710Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes.41901:04:09.710 --> 01:04:13.780The Alliance: Yeah, so yeah, I've I've met him years ago.42001:04:14.030 --> 01:04:16.340The Alliance: Oh, I'm blanking his name.42101:04:17.689 --> 01:04:20.289Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: He's yeah. I think his name is Ralph Bear.42201:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.900The Alliance: Oh, maybe I didn't meet him. That name doesn't sound familiar.42301:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Like with it.42401:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.979The Alliance: But yes, I am familiar with the Kabbalah center a little bit.42501:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.080Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I'm good.42601:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.680The Alliance: Is that who you work with.42701:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.131Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, that's that's kind of where? Where? Where I go to.42801:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.130The Alliance: Cool.42901:04:36.130 --> 01:04:36.880Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hey? What's up?43001:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.780The Alliance: Stove.43101:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.769Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It's it's a pretty big community. And the you know, Madonna was here, and all of that stuff so it can43201:04:43.460 --> 01:04:49.400Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that does popularize did popularize the the tender for sure.43301:04:49.650 --> 01:04:54.779Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But I also know that that people who are kind of more traditional not always.43401:04:54.780 --> 01:04:59.300The Alliance: Yeah, I like, I I sort of always love the Kabbalah center because43501:05:00.440 --> 01:05:08.680The Alliance: I'm not saying it's the right way. I don't know if there's a right way. You know what I mean. I just don't like it. When spiritual traditions are walled off43601:05:09.080 --> 01:05:26.500The Alliance: from people based on what sex you are and what you you know what I like. I don't like those kinds of things. I think we're all adults, and we could make adults. So I like anything that sort of like democratizes expertise a little bit I like, and I'm just interested to see where it goes. Always.43701:05:27.180 --> 01:05:33.419Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, we're we're definitely having having a very interesting learning learning journey.43801:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.880Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That's for sure.43901:05:36.750 --> 01:05:51.490The Alliance: I have been trying to reread the Talmud now for a couple of years, and trying to see if I could learn anything from the Talmud, because I've never read the I mean, I like I paid 0 attention to the Talmud ever, never. And I was. Finally, I was like, Wow, there's a lot of wisdom in here.44001:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.160The Alliance: If you could sort of get through the like.44101:05:54.230 --> 01:06:10.339The Alliance: I love what it's an endless truth filter right like it's like I'm going to give you the same argument from 75 different perspectives. So you believe me, it's amazing. It's kind of an amazing thing that they did. It's hard to like sift through it. To find out the like.44201:06:10.410 --> 01:06:29.869The Alliance: This is the actual way you might want to live like. It's very like I love it because it's very Jewish. It was very how my brain works, too, which is like, surround it, and look at it from it all sides. But I don't necessarily know how to use it as a practical anything. I can't figure that part out yet.44301:06:31.630 --> 01:06:36.160Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I I think I think, for for me the practical tools were44401:06:36.330 --> 01:06:44.429Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: were the most kind of helpful ones just starting on the on the on, the on the basics, such as44501:06:44.830 --> 01:06:47.120Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know they gave us.44601:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.186Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So it's a weird thing, I mean, I think if you have, if you have a few more seconds. I'll show you.44701:06:53.980 --> 01:06:58.030Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: it's called the proactive formula, right.44801:06:59.030 --> 01:06:59.950The Alliance: Okay.44901:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.170Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: If this alright, I got it.45001:07:02.450 --> 01:07:08.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And basically, it basically says, whenever you're frustrated like, read this, and there's like a 4 step thing which says.45101:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.970The Alliance: Okay.45201:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.399Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Pause, observe your reactive nature. Second.45301:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: become aware that your reaction is the real enemy. 3, rd realize the situation is acting is actually coming from the light.45401:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 4, th ask the light for help in finding the best proactive solution to the situation.45501:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and you know, I think for for people45601:07:31.540 --> 01:07:39.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I I definitely came there like being all over the place, and and being the jumpy and all that stuff. So even even that sort of45701:07:39.130 --> 01:07:43.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 4 step thing already kind of.45801:07:43.370 --> 01:07:53.839The Alliance: Pattern interrupt. I mean, that's a like dude. It's a huge pattern. Interrupt. Anything like that is great, right? I don't know. Like the and the 1st 2 steps are standard45901:07:54.650 --> 01:08:13.510The Alliance: Buddhism. You know what I mean. Standard mindfulness. Any of that stuff, and the next 2 are a spiritual layer to it that I'd be interested like I'm interested in. Oh, that's interesting. So it's a non-reactive thing, followed by prayer, which is interesting, like in a set like what is. So46001:08:13.760 --> 01:08:23.430The Alliance: that's a cool little. Okay, I like that. That's a solid play. I mean, dude anything that makes you a little more non reactive in the moment, in my opinion, is good.46101:08:24.149 --> 01:08:38.299Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And this is sort of what they want to give you when the when you walk in the 1st time you said, Okay, like the the very least thing you can have is just like, put it in your pocket, and just carry this with you, and look at it every now and then, and I think they're all all about that like finding this easy sort of46201:08:39.859 --> 01:08:44.567Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: tools to for people to take to take on board them. And46301:08:45.449 --> 01:08:50.979Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But but, for instance, it's it's crazy I was talking to. To. To my rabbi46401:08:51.609 --> 01:09:17.659Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: around the basically what you said. I talked to him about the same thing 3 days ago, and he couldn't give me an an explanation, and he just told me like, listen, this thing is several 1,000 years old, like just just taken on board. And then I go. I go. And you explain how the thing works. Different neuroscience perspective. I'm like, okay, listen, that's the word.46501:09:17.660 --> 01:09:18.800The Alliance: Did I46601:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.599Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: You know. You know.46701:09:22.600 --> 01:09:52.409The Alliance: The guy who really has done the most work on Kabbalah Shahar Arzi. He's at Jerusalem University, and he's really he teamed up with Moshe, Adele, and they went looking for, like all the neurobiological correlates of some of the Kabbalah mystical traditions. But people have really started to poke at Kabbalah, even Andy Newberg, my mentor, has done some stuff. There's a lot of Jewish neuroscientists. So it lends itself pretty well.46801:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.526The Alliance: I think.46901:09:54.540 --> 01:10:14.410The Alliance: what the question I want to leave you with as a last thought is as you were reading it. And what I was wondering is, I was like, Okay, so you've come into my company. You bought my company. We're gonna we're gonna do this digital transformation. I'm the new CEO. What goes on the little card that you give me to read every time I run into a problem.47001:10:15.110 --> 01:10:20.350The Alliance: What's the card that Anatoly has for the CEO like? If this is the thing that helped you47101:10:20.560 --> 01:10:30.289The Alliance: right like, what's the what's the version that goes to the CEO? And and I'm not saying like that might give you your start for your coaching right.47201:10:30.290 --> 01:10:38.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes, I think it's definitely something about psychological safety, about aligned goals.47301:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah.47401:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.160The Alliance: You know the problem with aligned goals and psychological safety.47501:10:49.770 --> 01:10:53.540Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: What it takes time to get there.47601:10:53.690 --> 01:11:03.000The Alliance: Yeah, it's earned. It's earned right? It's an earned like it's a it's really an earned thing. And it doesn't.47701:11:03.100 --> 01:11:26.069The Alliance: It? Engineers through action. It doesn't really like all the things about psychological safety that they want to be true. Oh, we are going to communicate our way there. Yeah, those things are important. You like. You don't want to talk over each other. You don't want to play power game like that stuff, but it's earned, man. It's a tricky. It's a tricky thing. That's what one of the reasons I sort of like. I like collective ambition47801:11:26.845 --> 01:11:31.830The Alliance: as a lever, first, st because it it caps into people's extrinsic motivations.47901:11:32.715 --> 01:11:39.889The Alliance: Also. And people learn to trust each other when you help each other, reach goals48001:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.069The Alliance: and solve problems. Right? That's like that's that's where psychological safety really comes from.48101:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.250The Alliance: You can't fake some of this stuff48201:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.740The Alliance: I found.48301:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.691The Alliance: Alright. I'm gonna jump48401:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.229Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hey? Thank you very much.48501:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.350The Alliance: We ran over. Thank you for the extra 10 min.48601:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.770Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Can I go?48701:12:00.770 --> 01:12:01.709The Alliance: Novel Explanation.48801:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.670Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Can I have just 30 more seconds for one.48901:12:04.670 --> 01:12:05.699The Alliance: Oh, yeah, of course.49001:12:08.230 --> 01:12:13.539Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Are you ever in London and or other other way around?49101:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.560Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Is there a way to convince you to come here.49201:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.829The Alliance: So this is what I've always said with London. I so I I I haven't been in London49301:12:24.190 --> 01:12:32.200The Alliance: long time, and the and I don't know why, like people bring me. I speak all over Europe all the time.49401:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.399The Alliance: I only when I so because of the I only travel.49501:12:36.510 --> 01:12:49.260The Alliance: especially if I'm going to Europe, or whatever. If people are hiring me right, I like otherwise it's just not. I'm not making a hundred $1,000. It's not really worth me going to Europe. And what I've said to people all along is like.49601:12:49.460 --> 01:13:13.170The Alliance: that's sort of my minimum to like, get to Europe. But if you find, you know, if that like, find a couple of companies who want me to come in, I'll come in and do 2 speeches, and whatever we've. I've always wondered about London. I'm like this is so weird. It's a center for commerce and industry, like I've been all over the world, and yet I've never been been to London talking about flow and peak performance. It's so49701:13:13.290 --> 01:13:37.449The Alliance: odd. And I, rarely. I've done a bunch of fairly big like podcasts. And like, I know I have a big audience in London, because I see what the sales numbers are on my books and things like that. You know what I mean like, I've got a huge audience there. I can't figure out why nobody's brought me there. Why, I don't go to London. London is a weird place, as you know, I love the British not usually when they're in London.49801:13:37.730 --> 01:13:43.392The Alliance: I love them. When they're in other countries. In London they become something very different.49901:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.491The Alliance: but no, I I don't know. I like I'm I'm more than open to coming to London. I like it there.50001:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.960The Alliance: Fucking50101:13:53.220 --> 01:14:08.640The Alliance: hate the goddamn airport. But besides that, I you know I like it. They're just fine. It's an easy trip from La. You know what I mean. I fly to la, and I just you go to sleep, but I wake up in London. So I'm totally open to it. I just don't know why I haven't been there.50201:14:09.410 --> 01:14:13.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay. Well, I'll I'll I'll try to50301:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: think of of about a good good, a good reason, or50401:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.350Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: kind of good cost for for50501:14:20.740 --> 01:14:27.029Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: for that. I I think that would be awesome there. I I'm sure there will be a lot of people who would be super excited to see here.50601:14:28.850 --> 01:14:35.740The Alliance: I I look! I'd love I I'm not. I'm not mad at the idea. I like how you think it be fun.50701:14:36.345 --> 01:14:40.860The Alliance: That was the other reason I wanted to. I was like, I'm gonna build the alliance. So I can like50801:14:41.830 --> 01:15:06.920The Alliance: start traveling a little bit more like intentionally rather than sort of like, get bounced around for these events where I just sort of go. And it's like airport hotel event and back. And I'm like, Okay, but I didn't change it. I made some money and I helped some people, but like it. Didn't I like I'd rather go where there's people I I can start to develop relationships with a little bit, so I don't know.50901:15:07.423 --> 01:15:08.990The Alliance: But I'm open to it.51001:15:09.810 --> 01:15:13.350The Alliance: Thank you for joining the alliance. Your energy was great.51101:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.989Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That was a that was a very drunken night. By the way.51201:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.315The Alliance: It was a very drunken night I51301:15:20.950 --> 01:15:35.939The Alliance: When I finally got everybody out of the room I was sort of like looking around. I was like, Whoa! What time is it? It's like one am. Or 1230. I was like, what the fuck I gotta ski tomorrow. What did you guys do to me? Yeah, anyways, that was really fucking fun. I liked it.51401:15:36.090 --> 01:15:43.329The Alliance: I had a good time, so thank you for being a part of it, and I will see you on Thursday, and I'll catch you in a month.51501:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.370Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: See you see you later. Thank you.51601:15:45.370 --> 01:15:46.249The Alliance: Take care, sir.
