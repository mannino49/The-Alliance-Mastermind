WEBVTT100:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.590Courtney Karnes: Hello!200:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.959The Alliance: Morning, how are you?300:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.559Courtney Karnes: Oh, I'm good. Hang on, let me get my audio right.400:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.129Courtney Karnes: This is my all-day thing.500:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.760Courtney Karnes: Hello?600:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.809The Alliance: It was fine on my end.700:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.860Courtney Karnes: No, I know, but I want to hear you in my head. I don't want to hear you out of my computer.800:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.470The Alliance: Oh, go to your, É.900:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.070Courtney Karnes: No, I'm good.1000:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.960The Alliance: Good.1100:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.929Courtney Karnes: Solve my other problems, don't solve that one. Hi!1200:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.350The Alliance: Hi, how are you? Alright.1300:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.960Courtney Karnes: Good.1400:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.790The Alliance: Oh.1500:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.149The Alliance: Where are we?1600:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.110The Alliance: Alliance Wise.1700:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.000Courtney Karnes: I don't know. I've been on a whole journey.1800:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220Courtney Karnes: Say more about that question, and I'll drop in.1900:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.000Courtney Karnes: just transitioning from an IPO pitch, prep, go.2000:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.330The Alliance: Ow. Ugh.2100:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.480The Alliance: Hey, man.2200:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.940The Alliance: figure out which way next. Some of that is obviously FRI, perhaps. Seems like it, which is a good thing.2300:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.630The Alliance: But there's a lot of other stuff going on, and I want to know,2400:02:34.930 --> 00:02:46.580The Alliance: how, É what has happened to your life? How does it feel different? Have you noticed changes in productivity, creativity, mood, sleep?2500:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.530The Alliance: Are you eating better? Are you exercising more? Do you find yourself doing cocaine on the weekends with people you don't know?2600:02:56.080 --> 00:03:07.210Courtney Karnes: That would be on the record. I would not answer that question. No, I already told you my position on that. I would never, I would never, because IÉ anyway, no. But yes to all the other things. Okay, so, É2700:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.110Courtney Karnes: What is my journey with this?2800:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.440Courtney Karnes: It's beenÉ it's been a really great journey. I think theÉ theÉ the bestÉ É2900:03:19.870 --> 00:03:31.259Courtney Karnes: what I've noticed in myself is the power of clarity. Clarity and specificity, which is something I had been driving towards before, but the rigor ofÉ3000:03:31.440 --> 00:03:46.690Courtney Karnes: clarity and specificity consistently, and really getting clear on what is aÉ what is a big picture goal or vision I have for my life, and gettingÉ just continuing to hammer it. I think you and I talked about it in the very first session, which was, like.3100:03:46.950 --> 00:04:00.820Courtney Karnes: your words aren't specific enough. You're either using too many words, or I'm not sure what that means. It can be kind of nebulous, andÉ and I think that rigor around getting really clear on what the intention is3200:04:01.330 --> 00:04:15.679Courtney Karnes: has been very helpful. And not only that, itÉ this process has just beenÉ I feel like it's beenÉ it's almost been like the Golden Gate Bridge. Like, it's constant refinement of everything that I've laid out in my stack, from big picture goals.3300:04:15.680 --> 00:04:26.039Courtney Karnes: to milestones I've set for myself, to habits I'm implementing, but I'm just going back and forth over it and making sure that things aren't being missed.3400:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.189Courtney Karnes: theÉ one of the most powerful things for me isÉ and I notice that I fall off the map when myÉ when I'm not setting my clear goals.3500:04:34.580 --> 00:04:53.109Courtney Karnes: And I don't know what's next. And I'll, like, as then, I'll, like, get on the computer the next morning, and I'll just be all over the map, getting stuff done. I'll do stuff for me, I'll do stuff for work, but nothing's really batched or specific. And the batching and the specificity has been really helpful for me in output. So, for that, I've noticedÉ3600:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.440Courtney Karnes: When I drop in, I drop in really deep. There was a point that I got very deep, and I, like.3700:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.780Courtney Karnes: Didn't know it was happening in the outside world, so that had been kind of, É3800:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.229Courtney Karnes: Maybe I went a little too deep, but it felt good to do that. You know, it feels good to lose yourself in the work and the focus.3900:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.010Courtney Karnes: And then from, like, a sleep and lifestyle standpoint, I, É4000:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.270Courtney Karnes: I've always prioritized sleep, I've always prioritized exercise.4100:05:21.900 --> 00:05:38.310Courtney Karnes: I think that I didn't put enough focus onÉ or I haven't yet put enough focus on the creativity microdose, because when I do do it, I get, like, these weird unlocks, and they're actually valuable. Good job. So, I don't know, it's a lot of rambling, butÉ4200:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.449Courtney Karnes: É I feel very clear, and I feel very confident, and I feel veryÉ4300:05:49.320 --> 00:06:07.760Courtney Karnes: like, a lot of the questions that were lingering, although I don't know the path, like, the path to get to my ultimate could still look like many things, I still moreÉ I feel more confident in the steps that I'm taking, because I don't have to know how they architect towards what the end result will be, if that makes sense.4400:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.069The Alliance: Excuse me?4500:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.010The Alliance: Does make sense. I, two thingsÉ or most of mind.4600:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.230The Alliance: Did you notice when you read Build?4700:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.899The Alliance: ButÉ by Tony Fidel.4800:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.329The Alliance: how much heÉ how rigorous he is with retesting and retesting. It'sÉ I was, É4900:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.769The Alliance: I was not surprised. I learned my iterative5000:06:36.310 --> 00:06:50.160The Alliance: examination skills with editors, sending back copy, do it again. Do it again. Do it again. This is unclear. This is unclear. Do it again. That forever and ever. And then in business, product testing, right?5100:06:50.260 --> 00:06:58.660The Alliance: But, I love applying it, to life. One of the things, I'm gonna ask you to do between now and,5200:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.349The Alliance: when we are together in New York, because it's fixed, is I just want you to run, 3 different experiments.5300:07:09.010 --> 00:07:18.310The Alliance: One week, and I think you should, depending on what your schedule is, so calendar it out and just block it. One week, force yourself to do the creativity microdose.5400:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.750The Alliance: 5 days a week Right? Don't do it 7, 7 might be much, but try 5, right?5500:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.460The Alliance: Then another week, try 3.5600:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.560The Alliance: Every other day, every third day. And then one week.5700:07:32.680 --> 00:07:50.029The Alliance: Literally just try, like, a 2-hour drawing block, or movement block, like, new movement block, or writing block, whatever you want to do, and just take notes, run the experiment, see, you've already said, hey, this is powerful, great. The next question is, how much5800:07:50.190 --> 00:08:03.119The Alliance: do you need it to get the effects you're sort of looking for? So, let's test that a little bit over the next month, because it's the thing that you haven't adopted. So, let's do that. Are you, is the pasta been useful at all?5900:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.049Courtney Karnes: Yeah, the Vipassana has been useful. IÉ I still vacillate between that andÉ6000:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.619Courtney Karnes: and Joe Dispenza, and sometimes Michael Beckwith, just to get a little bit ofÉ6100:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.209Courtney Karnes: change in there, if it's possible.6200:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.299The Alliance: What I would tell you to do, just FYI, isÉ6300:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.809The Alliance: If you're going to do Joe's Mad.6400:08:24.910 --> 00:08:49.859The Alliance: Don't do it on a day of your creativity microdosing, because they'reÉ they're goingÉ the problem with Joe Dispenza, forget, like, Joe Dispenza, is he talks all the time. That's a focused meditation. You're, like, you're not actuallyÉ it's not actually even a meditation. When you look at that kind of talking onÉ in the brain, it's basicallyÉ you're basically listening to a lecture with breathing, which is not bad. It'll balance out the nervous system, and, it does cool things for your imagination.6500:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.790The Alliance: discovered.6600:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.809The Alliance: É So it's not, but as a system, it's, linear. So if you wanna, like.6700:08:56.810 --> 00:09:13.059The Alliance: do accounting, or problem-solve that way, great. Do Joe first. If you want creativity and the expansion, you want to try for the pasta, especially the open census part, where you're really just, like, watching what comes into your brain and not judging everything.6800:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.100The Alliance: and labeling.6900:09:16.040 --> 00:09:34.370Courtney Karnes: That's a good reminder, actually, and you've said this before, and I told you when I did the Vipassana for the first time that IÉ I got, like, very quickly these intuitive hits, and the first one was, like, I'm oversaturated in input, like, in content, and being creative isn't a problem for me.7000:09:35.120 --> 00:09:54.640Courtney Karnes: But there's justÉ there's always something going on there, so the stillness of the Vipassana allowed things to come up and through and out, versus jamming it down with more information. And I can see how Joe's creativity or, like, his expansiveness would beÉ7100:09:55.680 --> 00:10:08.370Courtney Karnes: it kind of compounds on some of the problem, I think. If I'm hearing you correctly, I hear that it may compound on some of the problem, because it's constant, like, I love all the shiny, big.7200:10:08.370 --> 00:10:17.809Courtney Karnes: feel-good things, and Joe is big and feels good, because I can access different things and have visions on different things, but it doesn't make me drop down and see what's7300:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.900Courtney Karnes: Rooted already in.7400:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.450The Alliance: And the whole point, like, the pasta is aboutÉ7500:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.529The Alliance: IDN, you can't really work when your desk is a mess.7600:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.550The Alliance: The process is the same thing. It'sÉ you're decluttering the mind, literally, right?7700:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.920Courtney Karnes: Yeah.7800:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.419The Alliance: pulling this stuff out, which is why, if you want to go further and think about it more.7900:10:40.480 --> 00:10:52.419The Alliance: I would really recommend reading Shins and Young's book, The Science of Enlightenment. He misuses the word flow all the way through it, or he has a very different meditative experience.8000:10:52.420 --> 00:11:07.369The Alliance: Than a lot of people, which could be true, because he did come out of the Zen tradition, and it canÉ it does unlock some flow stuff, so I don't know exactly what he's doing, but I loveÉ he's got the six categories that human experience can fall into.8100:11:07.550 --> 00:11:13.989The Alliance: You're either hearing something externally, or you're hearing a voice in your head. You're either,8200:11:15.150 --> 00:11:27.689The Alliance: thinking something, feeling something inside, outside, thinking something, or hearing an idea, right? And once you figure out what those categories are, when stuff comes up, you can plop them, you can just label it.8300:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.140Courtney Karnes: Mmm.8400:11:28.140 --> 00:11:45.659The Alliance: external hearing, andÉ right? And what it starts to do is it gives you a really cool look at yourÉ what your mind does when it's quiet, and when it'sÉ and when it's noisy, and so it just allows youÉ it gives you a cleaning tool that you can use a lot.8500:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.300The Alliance: I think that might be useful for you.8600:11:48.300 --> 00:11:58.630Courtney Karnes: Yeah, probably so. Okay. Can you say again, I heard you say 3-week experiment, creativity microdose 5 times 1 week, 3 times the next week. What was the last one? I missed it.8700:11:58.630 --> 00:12:05.910The Alliance: The last one I'd like you to do, like, longer blocks. So, like, it'sÉ I would, like.8800:12:05.910 --> 00:12:19.040The Alliance: two-hour block, a two-hour block is really interesting, if you're drawing, for example. If you have the time, orÉ butÉ or two one-hour blocks, like, goÉ just really go into it, because I want to seeÉ8900:12:19.360 --> 00:12:33.190The Alliance: you said it was helpful for you, it did some stuff. I want to see if a longer creativity experience is really gonna drop you into flow and start unlocking some other stuff and give you, like, a deep flow fallback when you can't go surfing or something like that.9000:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.610Courtney Karnes: Yeah.9100:12:33.610 --> 00:12:47.189The Alliance: I have a feeling with you it will. You're wired very similar to people who have that experience, and it's open to them, which is really, it's really powerful. It's great to have as a tool.9200:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.789Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I like that.9300:12:48.790 --> 00:12:56.080The Alliance: It's worth just running the experiment for 3 weeks. We'll putÉ we'll cap it, we'll put a time limit around and say, alright, we'll try this for 3 weeks.9400:12:56.080 --> 00:13:11.789The Alliance: And, you know, you couldÉ if youÉ if you want to, like, double it down withÉ with the Vipassana, for sure, so at least you can know you're getting those sections in, and then check out Shins and Young's The Science of Alignment. That's in theÉ in theÉ in the workbook toolbook that's listed, so you have9500:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.149The Alliance: You have that in there as well, I pointed to it.9600:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.989Courtney Karnes: Are we gonna have access to that stuff after this thing ends?9700:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.720Courtney Karnes: ThatÉ the website?9800:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.940Courtney Karnes: I'll ask Ryan. Don't worry about it.9900:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.100The Alliance: Yeah, I gottaÉ IÉ yes.10000:13:28.330 --> 00:13:36.880The Alliance: I have to think about that, though, because I've discovered there areÉ there's some stuff around that.10100:13:36.910 --> 00:13:53.329The Alliance: Legally, in terms of keeping things on after the course, because I'm nowÉ you go back and take the course material, decide to divorce your husband and start Burning Man on the moon, you can sue me, and I'm liable. And the course is long over, and that curriculum is up there, so IÉ10200:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.819The Alliance: Possibly have to put a liability waiver on the front end.10300:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.459Courtney Karnes: Yeah, okay, alright.10400:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.989Courtney Karnes: And I can hit Ryan with that question, too, so it's coming.10500:14:02.990 --> 00:14:15.440The Alliance: Brian doesn't have anÉ yeah, Ryan doesn't have the answer. It's myÉ it's gonna be my answer. And I, like, we have to draw a lot. This is what we have to do with all the archives for the Flow Research Collective, which is how I know this, but I'm gonna get in front of it right now.10600:14:15.440 --> 00:14:28.379The Alliance: after the course is done, you can have access, but you're on your own on that. Otherwise, if I want to shut down the company, there's, like, this tail effect. It's terrifying, and I gotta pay for insurance ad nauseam. Not your problem.10700:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.040The Alliance: Tell me how, É10800:14:33.490 --> 00:14:38.439The Alliance: bringingÉ I sent you a very complicated paper that you're gonna love on purpose. I don't know if you saw it.10900:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.070Courtney Karnes: Not yet.11000:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.309The Alliance: But you saw that I sent it, É.11100:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.190Courtney Karnes: Yep.11200:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.199Courtney Karnes: Yes, now I see it.11300:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.920Courtney Karnes: Strange attractors. I like it.11400:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.150Courtney Karnes: All your papers are complicated. It takes a minute for my brain.11500:14:53.150 --> 00:15:00.679The Alliance: That one's gonnaÉ this oneÉ this one's gonna be, harder than the others, because it's aÉ they're sequenced on,11600:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.360The Alliance: There's a lot of, like, sort of implied knowledge in this one.11700:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.230The Alliance: More so than my other ones, É SoÉ.11800:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.220Courtney Karnes: Okay.11900:15:11.580 --> 00:15:11.930The Alliance: And it's.12000:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.620Courtney Karnes: accomplished.12100:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.000The Alliance: But it's great. It's a great paper.12200:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.610The Alliance: And it's the very first scientific theory of synchronicity ever in history.12300:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.240Courtney Karnes: HmmÉ.12400:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.530The Alliance: On top of that, which is cool. É12500:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.169The Alliance: How's the purpose rollout going at work? How was that?12600:15:32.430 --> 00:15:40.140Courtney Karnes: Dude, it's all muddy, actually, like, I mean, and that was my goal. I told you at the very beginning, I started this job in particular12700:15:40.520 --> 00:15:55.680Courtney Karnes: at a phase in my life when I was like, if it's not alignment, I don't want it. Like, if I can't be who I am at work, and I can't be who I am during the day, like, if it's not all one person, I don't want it. And this job has delivered me the opportunity, like, totally to go deep in myself and justÉ12800:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.529Courtney Karnes: B. And that is bringing me more joy thanÉ12900:16:01.940 --> 00:16:08.160Courtney Karnes: like, immeasurable joy, and it's starting to compound, and it feels really, really good. I think, É13000:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.750Courtney Karnes: the purpose rollout at work and all the shit that I had been doing thisÉ13100:16:13.770 --> 00:16:29.960Courtney Karnes: this protocol that I had built, that I've been running with some people, that's feeling good. And, like, running people through a growth strategy, and helping them see, kind of, the reflection of who they are today, and the strengths that they have in this world today that they may not13200:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.939Courtney Karnes: Often observe, and bringing those to the forefront, and then figuring out which things need to be dropped13300:16:36.340 --> 00:16:42.639Courtney Karnes: A way, so that they can create this version of themselves that they want to move towards, versus, like.13400:16:42.780 --> 00:16:57.030Courtney Karnes: constantly running in the cycle of their past, and whatever, like, that has been awesome, actually, and the feedback that I've gotten in the process, I took Brian through the process, I took a couple other people through the process, and now I've just been so busy, I haven't been able to do it, but, like.13500:16:57.030 --> 00:17:05.040Courtney Karnes: there's a lot of value in that, in the consistency of reminding yourself of who you're becoming, and what that looks like. I know the value of that for me.13600:17:05.430 --> 00:17:15.780Courtney Karnes: And from a strategic standpoint at work, with the lawyers who are like, you know lawyers, it's your brother. It's like this hard-driving, non-creative.13700:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.100Courtney Karnes: like, non-strategic group of people, but being able to unlock in them kind of thisÉ13800:17:22.599 --> 00:17:36.599Courtney Karnes: this power that they didn't know they had, or a connection to something outside of what it means to be a lawyer so that they can apply it in. It's been really powerful, and I think there's a lot there that needs more time and space to become, but.13900:17:37.970 --> 00:17:43.029The Alliance: Based on the time and space to become two places you are going to want to look.14000:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.740The Alliance: One is the psychological framework, known as ACT.14100:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.109The Alliance: É People love it. You're gonnaÉ sooner or later, you're gonna bump into it. It getsÉ14200:17:57.780 --> 00:18:09.600The Alliance: over-applied a little bit, but, it's a very good, simple behavioral change tool. The other thing you want to look at, because in my opinion.14300:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.680The Alliance: From a psychological standpoint.14400:18:13.940 --> 00:18:19.729The Alliance: it's useful to have a little bit of ACT, and it's useful to have narrative restructuring stuff.14500:18:20.120 --> 00:18:26.740The Alliance: Because it's about, right, thisÉ you gotta tell yourself a different story in your head, right? Totally. And É14600:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.859The Alliance: With lawyers, it's especially troubling because they have fixed mindsets because of what they do for a living.14700:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.580Courtney Karnes: Yeah.14800:18:36.110 --> 00:18:42.049Courtney Karnes: yes, that storytelling piece isÉ is everything, and I think thatÉ that for myself, like.14900:18:43.110 --> 00:18:59.749Courtney Karnes: when I figure out what's gonna claim my time, energy, and effort outside of work, and what that all becomes, andÉ and I hope it's with you, but, like, what is this budding of, like, the storytelling component? And there's something in that for me, butÉ So, if you want.15000:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.920The Alliance: I will put you on the phone with Mike.15100:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.440The Alliance: Dear friend, she's like my kid's sister.15200:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.759The Alliance: Beac of Victoria,15300:19:07.320 --> 00:19:23.129The Alliance: And, Vika is, does professional storytelling with companies. She goes into companies and changes the way they tell stories and things like that, and she's very vivacious, and she's very high energy, and soonÉ ifÉ the other thing is this, Courtney.15400:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.850The Alliance: While you're goingÉ while you're reviewing that stuff.15500:19:28.290 --> 00:19:35.279The Alliance: I haven't yet. I like her frame, I like how she thinks about it, I like how she talks about it, she's changed my mind about this stuff.15600:19:35.660 --> 00:19:42.390The Alliance: I don't know if she's best in show, or just has a really good understanding of it.15700:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.870Courtney Karnes: Good morning.15800:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.359The Alliance: results for people. The reason I mentioned the second half is15900:19:46.640 --> 00:19:57.869The Alliance: I think, in the end, there's going to be a narrative restructuring component in FRI. I think that's a framework that we're going to end up leaning on. Sarah Sarkis, who's with us.16000:19:57.870 --> 00:20:12.390The Alliance: has, in her work in peak performance, has started bringing in narrative storytelling psychologists as well. She's hadÉ this was independent of me, we both had the same instinct, sort of thisÉ Vika turned me around on it. She yelled at me one day.16100:20:12.440 --> 00:20:23.239The Alliance: about, my neurobiology-first approach, and said that there's certain people that even if you get them past burnout, you have to change the story. And I realized in my frame.16200:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.170The Alliance: He was right, because there are certain stories you always have to change, soÉ.16300:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.270Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I would actually really value a connection with her.16400:20:32.270 --> 00:20:50.500Courtney Karnes: Mainly because I would like to hack the storytelling component in the corporateÉ the storytelling component shapes literally everything, right? Like, we've both said already, the story that you tell yourself is the life that you live, and it has the power to shape and reshape who you are. But also, from a corporate perspective.16500:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.819Courtney Karnes: there isÉ16600:20:52.250 --> 00:21:00.079Courtney Karnes: we were terrible at it, one, and we really beat ourselves against our heads against the wall, trying to think about, what is it that I did? Like.16700:21:00.080 --> 00:21:17.480Courtney Karnes: you know, I hosted this thing, I did blah, I did blah, and I'm, like, pulling all these threads together to architect a narrative, which I can do powerfully, but I know I can do more powerfully. And connecting with someone like her, just to kind of hear the pieces of it, to start to think about how does that become16800:21:17.730 --> 00:21:27.440Courtney Karnes: A process or a system that unlocks for people regularly the opportunity to grow and scale their visions and businesses and themselves is huge.16900:21:28.370 --> 00:21:35.790The Alliance: Alright, I will introduce you to Vika, and in our time remaining, what challenges are you solving? What am I helping you with?17000:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.530Courtney Karnes: MmmÉ.17100:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.120The Alliance: I've got this new guy in my life, his name's Steven, he's a total fucking pain in the ass.17200:21:48.120 --> 00:22:01.999Courtney Karnes: He's such a pain in the ass, but I love him so much. I mean, the thing is, Steven, like, I feel like I'm at thisÉ I told you when I met you that first time, when we set up that call before you17300:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.700Courtney Karnes: before I joined the collective.17400:22:06.380 --> 00:22:17.619Courtney Karnes: Like, I am at this cuspy point in life, and I have felt, like, on the verge of a cusp for a really long time, but now I'm, like, actually onÉ on that peak.17500:22:18.020 --> 00:22:25.430Courtney Karnes: And I'm starting to see a landscape of opportunity, and I'm seeing opportunity come up and through.17600:22:25.870 --> 00:22:35.380Courtney Karnes: because I have done so much work in myself, on my clarity, what does that look like? How am I showing up? What's my value? Like, I've got all of that kind of nailed.17700:22:35.680 --> 00:22:43.079Courtney Karnes: And now, like, as things start to come through, I'm like, holy shit, well, what is it? Like, whatÉ I think what I'mÉ I'm not struggling.17800:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.029Courtney Karnes: I'm like, what's the right move?17900:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.929Courtney Karnes: And to me, the right move.18000:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.459The Alliance: Does it make sense.18100:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.269Courtney Karnes: That makes me doubt or question the least.18200:22:52.870 --> 00:23:02.060Courtney Karnes: And the thing that feelsÉ like, I'mÉ I have toÉ I just have to trust, like, what feels good and right. And as I think about, like.18300:23:02.370 --> 00:23:18.829Courtney Karnes: with work, whether it's a bold move with work, or even a small move with work as architects towards bold with you, like, what is that? Like, what, you know, what is this? And I know we're trying to figure it out, and like, how much trust should there be in this relationship? And thenÉ18400:23:18.880 --> 00:23:25.859Courtney Karnes: in other opportunities, like, how much trust is there? Do I just trust and move forward? I don't know, I think what I'm struggling with isÉ18500:23:31.340 --> 00:23:40.899Courtney Karnes: I'm not struggling with abundance, I think I've attractedÉ IÉ there is abundance here and surrounding me, and as I look ahead, I'm like.18600:23:44.350 --> 00:23:58.819Courtney Karnes: what deserves my time, energy, and effort? I think that's the question. What deserves my time, energy, and effort? And I'm not gonna over-architect for myself what it becomes. I just want to do what feels the best and the most right right now.18700:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.109The Alliance: Okay. So, let's slow this down for half a second.18800:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.900Courtney Karnes: Yeah.18900:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.730The Alliance: the way I think about my life.19000:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.730The Alliance: I do 6 things every day.19100:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.759The Alliance: And that's all I ever do.19200:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.070The Alliance: É19300:24:15.990 --> 00:24:22.129The Alliance: Right? Right? I want to write great books, I want to advance flow science, I want to make the world a better place for animals.19400:24:22.660 --> 00:24:36.960The Alliance: all the business stuff I have to do that supports all those things. Sometimes they are together, sometimes I'm talking about, like, this meeting, or a meeting with a publicist, or doing a podcast. Everything else falls into that category. And then there'sÉ19500:24:38.620 --> 00:24:48.000The Alliance: exercise, which is usually trying to hurl myself down mountains, and my relationships, right, my family and friends. Those are the only 6 things I do. My point isÉ19600:24:48.690 --> 00:25:04.009The Alliance: Figure out, if you haveÉ figure out what your missions are, right, at the top. Not your purpose, your missions. What are my three big, sort of, missions? Where's the impact I want to have? And then, you can't do more than those. You just can't. Like, nobody can.19700:25:04.220 --> 00:25:15.479The Alliance: You have to really define opportunity by things you say no to, right? Otherwise, you scatter focus. And more than anything with you, and I've noticed this, it's justÉ19800:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.490The Alliance: Lee.19900:25:17.810 --> 00:25:26.360The Alliance: You play it off, really well, but, like, you don'tÉ you'reÉ you're very uncomfortable with uncertainty.20000:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.230The Alliance: You want to micromanage.20100:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.590The Alliance: YourÉ how your life unfolds.20200:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.660Courtney Karnes: Hmm.20300:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.119The Alliance: It's fine, except for a couple of things.20400:25:37.250 --> 00:25:43.620The Alliance: The flow path, and really anybody's path, is about creating conditions for emergence.20500:25:43.800 --> 00:26:00.300The Alliance: You can't see the stuff that's coming next often, right? And the Alliance and FRI is a good example, right? You just got on the phone with me because of a LinkedIn thing, and this is where it led, right? You saw none of that stuff coming. It emerged.20600:26:00.300 --> 00:26:10.390The Alliance: From a bunch of conditions that you created. Life tends to work that way, so you're essentially demanding that a complex system behave linearly, and it won't, because they don't.20700:26:10.410 --> 00:26:17.070The Alliance: And É The other thing is.20800:26:17.890 --> 00:26:24.440The Alliance: There's a lotÉ there'sÉ people have all this fear around making big, long mistakes.20900:26:24.450 --> 00:26:41.120The Alliance: But there are no big, long mistakes as long as you're learning, right? The question you have to ask yourself is, does this feel good in my gut, and am I going to learn this stuff in this next whatever it is that willÉ that I want to learn and help me become who I want to become?21000:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.460Courtney Karnes: That's true.21100:26:41.460 --> 00:26:57.999The Alliance: yes, you gotta track the learning, right? That's theÉ because the trust is like, is it gonna go this way? And honestly, like, I really like working with you. I see a long future with FRI, and I see a long future for FRI. None of those things could be true.21200:26:58.330 --> 00:27:15.720The Alliance: in, like, you know what I mean? Like, FRI could fail to get funding, all this initial excitement couldÉ we could get through the first experiment and never be able to raise money for the second. We could actually get disastrous results. None of those things are true, but we could. And by the way, this protocol will also work for schizophrenia.21300:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.880The Alliance: I just thought I'd throw that out there.21400:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.750Courtney Karnes: Just solve it all. Just do it all at once.21500:27:20.750 --> 00:27:30.629The Alliance: Well, I was looking at Carl Friston's early work today, because we're interviewing him in an hour, and I forgot that he'd started doing all this because of schizophrenia.21600:27:30.700 --> 00:27:50.310The Alliance: And that metastability and the free energy principle can, like, work on that. And that's where his work started. I totally forgotten. I was reading about it. I was like, oh yeah. And we know flow proneness decreases schizophrenia. Now we see the mechanism. I'm not gonna try to fundraise around it, but we'll, like, down the line, that will happen. It's right there.21700:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.679Courtney Karnes: Yeah, you said the flow path is about creating conditions for emergence. That'sÉ was that your words?21800:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.359Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I didn't make it up.21900:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.610Courtney Karnes: I think thatÉ22000:28:07.530 --> 00:28:13.490Courtney Karnes: That piece of it, like, the emergence piece, É22100:28:14.290 --> 00:28:21.839Courtney Karnes: is big, and IÉ and I haveÉ and you're right, like, andÉ and I doÉ I don'tÉ I haveÉ22200:28:23.020 --> 00:28:47.760Courtney Karnes: I overthink all the time, like, I'm constantly just whatever, and I've done a lot ofÉ I'm actually better, soÉ good thing you met me now versus before, because this is what I would call better, and we're on the path to becoming even more so, butÉ but the point I'm trying to make is, like, letting go of the calculation of the things, and just going with what feels good and right, andÉ and I don't really give a shÉ I mean, do I give a shit? Yeah, but, like.22300:28:48.090 --> 00:28:53.259Courtney Karnes: Can I control what the outcome is? No. And I just want to allow myself to have a little fun.22400:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.710Courtney Karnes: Take some risks.22500:28:54.870 --> 00:29:09.429Courtney Karnes: do some shit that's cool and feels like it's supporting something that I care about in a way that, like, if I can let my guard down and smile while doing it, only good things will come from that, and whether or not it works out, I can'tÉ.22600:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.069The Alliance: So, a couple things you need to know, okay? Because I know this about you, because22700:29:15.260 --> 00:29:22.340The Alliance: it was the clearest thing you told me about yourself, and your diagnostic, and your resume, and everything. SoÉ22800:29:23.370 --> 00:29:28.129The Alliance: What you really want on the other end of this emergent flow path.22900:29:29.300 --> 00:29:35.940The Alliance: whatÉ you're using a lot of words, you're overthinking, whatever. The whole point you're asking yourself is, will I be safe?23000:29:35.940 --> 00:29:49.720The Alliance: Will I be okay? Will I be happy on the other side of this? That's what you're trying to solve for. That's what we're always trying to solve for. The thing that you alwaysÉ this isÉ I've said this again and again, this is a great example. People don't trust their history.23100:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.269The Alliance: You have an amazing history of.23200:29:52.270 --> 00:29:52.590Courtney Karnes: Yeah.23300:29:52.590 --> 00:30:12.559The Alliance: whatever the fuck happens, you're gonna turn into the lemonade, you're gonna make something cool out of it, even if it hurts, you're gonna learn from it, you're gonna build from it. You do it over and over and over and over again in all these different fields. You're super adaptable. Resilience is adaptive flexibility. You're a ready habit. You also have great social skills.23400:30:13.170 --> 00:30:28.530The Alliance: Et cetera, et cetera. So you've got, like, whatever happens, you're actually fine, and you have a track record of life telling you you're fine, right? And you've got a family and a husband, so, like, you're not the only support system.23500:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.909The Alliance: Thank you. Maybe you are.23600:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.530Courtney Karnes: No, no, no, no, I've got a great community, you're right. I think, I thinkÉ.23700:30:34.530 --> 00:30:43.070The Alliance: I mean, like, my point is, like, trust is a very strong word for something that, truthfully, happens23800:30:43.560 --> 00:30:54.120The Alliance: over time, and you can't force trust, and trying to force trust breaks trust, and makes you doubt, and takes the fun out of everything, right? AndÉ23900:30:54.120 --> 00:31:02.359The Alliance: you know, it's slowly built up, right? I like to get drunk with people who I'm gonna work with.24000:31:02.360 --> 00:31:16.570The Alliance: Because I need to see how they're gonna behave, because there's a certain way that is gonna work, and there's a lot of ways that aren't. And so, like, I know if I'm gonna work long-term with somebody, I gotta see them drunk, I gotta see them scared.24100:31:16.680 --> 00:31:35.839The Alliance: And I gotta see them totally overwhelmed. Otherwise, I don't know who they are, and that's how I learned to trust them, right? You two, probably, right? You have a set of conditions. So, that's a slow process in trying to force it. You're cheating yourself out of great experiences. Instead, you gotta ask yourself, well, what's on the other side of trust?24200:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.200Courtney Karnes: Yeah.24300:31:36.200 --> 00:31:51.669The Alliance: oh, I'm looking for anti-fragility. What are the conditions that make me anti-fragile here? Right? Well, I'm learning and I'm growing, so whatever happens, I'm gonna come out better with more skills and knowledge than before, right? I don'tÉ my financials are notÉ24400:31:51.810 --> 00:32:03.040The Alliance: gonna go down the drain if this goes sideways, etc, etc. There'sÉ you have your conditions. I would ask you as another exercise between now and when we're together, is just make a list24500:32:03.090 --> 00:32:14.800The Alliance: of what are theÉ what do you mean by trust? What do you mean by, likeÉ whatÉ what would you get if you knew the things you're nowÉ that you now don't know, and then take a look at it.24600:32:14.840 --> 00:32:28.780The Alliance: And actually ask yourself, wait a minute, does my history tell me that, like, these things happen no matter what to me? Or is this actually something worth being concerned about? I'm not saying don't plan for the future. I think 2 years in advance, and IÉ24700:32:28.780 --> 00:32:35.129The Alliance: we'll look at the really bad side of everything that could go totally fucking wrong, and then I'llÉ24800:32:35.130 --> 00:32:52.720The Alliance: put it down after I've looked at it, and I've sort of made my map of where I can go wrong, because I'm like, I know, you know, can I come out on the other side of this? You know what I mean? I never get myselfÉ but I bootstrap everything. I don't get out over my skis anywhere. And I don't get my people out over their skis anywhere.24900:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.029The Alliance: It happened one time in my life with FRC, and É25000:32:57.310 --> 00:33:10.049The Alliance: we swam back from it, but, like, it happenedÉ we wereÉ we hadÉ we were way out over our skis with an advertising budget that was due, and a payroll that was due the first of the month, and then Google switched their calendaring algorithm, and suddenly.25100:33:10.700 --> 00:33:18.450The Alliance: People showing up for our calls went from 90% to 10%, and it nearly tanked the company.25200:33:18.450 --> 00:33:33.990The Alliance: And it, it took us a while to find and figure out and all that stuff, and it was the only time I've ever done it. I was like, okay, learn my lesson. Like, we literally almost went bankrupt, because we got too far ahead, and never again.25300:33:34.300 --> 00:33:41.469Courtney Karnes: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, this is a good reminder. I appreciate it, andÉ and especially at this point, like.25400:33:42.170 --> 00:33:54.019Courtney Karnes: it's allÉ it is, like, all joy over here. I feel very grateful. I'm totally digging all that's happening. I'm enjoying using my brain in all the different ways and how it's showing up for me. AndÉ25500:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.379Courtney Karnes: I told you when we met, I had aÉ25600:33:57.380 --> 00:34:17.409Courtney Karnes: issue with momentum that IÉ a long time ago, I would start to, like, as soon as things started to get going, I kind of sabotage it a little bit, because I was like, oh god, you know, what's it gonna be? I don't know the outcome, blah blah blah. AndÉ and I worked through that, and that was something I identified at the end of last year, and I'm like, IÉ momentum is my friend, I'm here for it. That's, like.25700:34:17.590 --> 00:34:30.769Courtney Karnes: what I'm after is building momentum in my life, and any sabotage I'm doing is something else I need to address in myself. I've addressed it. And now that I see the momentum picking up, and things, like, popping up out of the ground everywhere.25800:34:31.610 --> 00:34:43.549Courtney Karnes: I'mÉ I'm down for it, but I also don't want to overthink it and miss the blessing that is, like, right here, and the fact that things are coming through right here and right now, and just enjoy that. So it'sÉ it's a good reminder25900:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.219Courtney Karnes: That the emergence that's taking place right now is, like.26000:34:47.969 --> 00:34:52.819Courtney Karnes: That's a result of flow. And it is a cycle, and it's not always on, but justÉ.26100:34:52.820 --> 00:35:00.860The Alliance: And let meÉ and let me tell you what's coming, because it's going to happen. So thisÉ the momentum retraction, momentum retraction? One.26200:35:01.450 --> 00:35:17.629The Alliance: That's yin and yang. That's the cycle, right? It's goingÉ that's going to naturally happen anyways, because things have expansive and contractive cycles, in nature, right? The brain oscillates, seasons oscillate, everything oscillates. There's no way around that. One of theÉ26300:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.630The Alliance: things that often happens on Flow, and still happens to me. It's just, I'm better at26400:35:25.970 --> 00:35:31.240The Alliance: Delaying the happening, in a sense, is that,26500:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.850The Alliance: Often too many good things, the abundance.26600:35:35.080 --> 00:35:43.760The Alliance: And what you end up doing is saying yes to one or two more things than you normally would, and it's an abundance, and it's great, and everything's fantastic, and thenÉ26700:35:44.150 --> 00:35:53.759The Alliance: Your life is gonna get fucked up, because it's gonna go the other way, and it's not gonna be a work thing, it's gonna beÉ your kid gets sick, or your husband has aÉ26800:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.540The Alliance: broken ankle, or whatever it is, right? Your mom, your car, yourÉ26900:35:58.540 --> 00:36:14.930The Alliance: onÉ now your life is not anti-fragile anymore. It's fragile because you don't have enough time to handle the crisis that you know is going to come. So one of the things I tell people is, like, when youÉ when abundance is coming, you start saying yes to more things.27000:36:15.040 --> 00:36:34.240The Alliance: say yes to one less thing than you would instinctively say yes to, so you build that extra anti-fragility into your schedule when shit goes wrong, because it is goingÉ it will go wrong. So you have to prepare for that, the fact thatÉ and the only difference between success and failure27100:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.319The Alliance: And that is, I have enough extra bandwidth in my life to handle the shit that goes wrong.27200:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.980Courtney Karnes: Yeah.27300:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.740The Alliance: If you don't, you just get overwhelmed.27400:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.380The Alliance: And then you really retract.27500:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.049Courtney Karnes: That's it. I think that's it. And anyÉ not that I'm notÉ we're not here to talk about27600:36:50.150 --> 00:37:06.810Courtney Karnes: our work together, but any pressure you feel from me is, like, I want to say, IÉ I want this toÉ like, this is myÉ this is my number one horse in the race. Like, this is the one I'm most excited about. I wouldÉ IÉ I have a whole vision, and it fucking psychs me up. Like, I'm all excited about it.27700:37:07.130 --> 00:37:18.229Courtney Karnes: And any pressure you're feeling from me or any whatever is more like, I want to be able to trust it and move along so that I don't fill or say yes to other things that are gonnaÉ.27800:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.100The Alliance: Dude, I told you, like.27900:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.230Courtney Karnes: I know, I had toÉ.28000:37:21.230 --> 00:37:36.150The Alliance: For me, like, we've got, like, right now, the next 3 months are, let's test this together, let's make sure we're a good fit, and then we can look at it and go, okay, we have money coming in, or what, and weÉ you know what I mean. You're not gonna quit your day job anyway.28100:37:36.150 --> 00:37:52.730Courtney Karnes: No, and I'm also not looking for this discussion now, I'm just telling you, like, I do have to watch it, and I do just have to decide what is it that's gonna get my time, energy, and effort, right? And, like, just decide, like, cut everything else off.28200:37:52.730 --> 00:37:59.870The Alliance: The one thing you've got to let me know is, are you in or out? Because I'm leaning on you at this point for things FRI, and if you'reÉ.28300:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.510Courtney Karnes: Oh, yeah.28400:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.860The Alliance: Thank you.28500:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.509Courtney Karnes: I'm just making sureÉ.28600:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.490The Alliance: Sure. Alright, I'm just making sure.28700:38:03.490 --> 00:38:09.539Courtney Karnes: Yeah, no, I mean, that's the point I'm in. Like, I'm 100% on this, andÉ.28800:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.799The Alliance: sound 100%, you sound like you'reÉ28900:38:12.490 --> 00:38:17.359The Alliance: 75 and wannabe 85 and wavery.29000:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.520Courtney Karnes: No, I'm okay. That's fine. No, can youÉ29100:38:20.870 --> 00:38:37.390Courtney Karnes: Don't put words in myÉ my point is, like, I am 100% on this, there's no question. I'm psyched on it. I got a whole fucking map for it, like, just wait until we go. My point is, I am the type of person who will say, yes, there are other things coming through, and I'm like, oh, shit that!29200:38:37.490 --> 00:38:52.030Courtney Karnes: cool, like, I was after that too, and that's coming through. That's not my number one. This is, like I told you, this is my number one. I have a vision for this, and I just have to practice the discipline of not saying yes.29300:38:52.030 --> 00:39:00.889Courtney Karnes: to too many things, because I want to crush one thingÉ well, two things. My day job, which will be helpful, and this. Like, that's it.29400:39:00.890 --> 00:39:07.639The Alliance: Oh, so let me tell you a side thing, because I've been noticing it, and I think it's true. Just so you have an understanding, there'sÉ29500:39:08.900 --> 00:39:27.859The Alliance: I think over time, you're going to become a great coach in the room for a lot of this stuff. You're just too relatable, and I get that if you understand something, you probably can explain it to anybody, because I've watched that a little bit. So, there's all kinds of, like.29600:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.389The Alliance: corporate stuff that could spin on. There's other stuff.29700:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.440Courtney Karnes: I know!29800:39:32.440 --> 00:39:32.780The Alliance: spins off.29900:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.249Courtney Karnes: Peanuts! Like, that's, likeÉ.30000:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.330The Alliance: Just telling you.30100:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.240Courtney Karnes: That's where myÉ Anyways, I mean, thank you, I appreciate that.30200:39:38.240 --> 00:39:47.270The Alliance: I gotta go, I gotta go in, like, 5 minutes, so you got 5É thisÉ we're 10 minutes over. Let me give you oneÉ let's answer one more question, since we've spent a couple minutes on work stuff.30300:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.799Courtney Karnes: I don't haveÉ I don't haveÉ30400:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.589Courtney Karnes: I don't know, I'm not with it enough to have a question. IÉ my answer.30500:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.770The Alliance: You didn't prep.30600:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.400The Alliance: You didn't prep.30700:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.569Courtney Karnes: You wanna know why? Because I was drafting30800:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.100Courtney Karnes: you a mock-up agreement. Like, I'm doing other shit, man. I'm, like, making dreams come true, so I don'tÉ I don't know what to ask you. I'll ask you another time.30900:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.180Courtney Karnes: I don't know.31000:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.699Courtney Karnes: whatÉ what's, like, one word of wisdom you have for me that IÉ that IÉ we haven't uncovered yet? Like, give me one.31100:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.279The Alliance: Rebu Hobbin Flopby.31200:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.510Courtney Karnes: What?31300:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.310The Alliance: Rebo Hub and Flopby.31400:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.779Courtney Karnes: I don't know what that means.31500:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.200The Alliance: It doesn't mean anything.31600:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.050Courtney Karnes: Oh.31700:40:25.050 --> 00:40:31.030The Alliance: It was the thing my friend Chris said to the Canadian border guard, that got us31800:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.540The Alliance: Pulled out of the car, and completely strip-searched.31900:40:35.200 --> 00:40:44.120The Alliance: Which was great, because I was traveling withÉ everybody in the car was sober, and we were going to the 50th anniversary of AA in Montreal, but it didn't help.32000:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.019Courtney Karnes: Oh, too good, too good. Okay.32100:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.289The Alliance: That's my, yeah, that's my, that's my, that's my word of wisdom.32200:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.400The Alliance: I don't know if I have a word of wisdom, a single word?32300:41:00.400 --> 00:41:07.309Courtney Karnes: No, I don't know. I don'tÉ don't break yourself. If it's not coming to you, then it's not gonnaÉ it won't be that great, I'll be honest with you.32400:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.070The Alliance: Fair enough.32500:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.800Courtney Karnes: Deliver later, just deliver later.32600:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.020The Alliance: Fair enough, fair enough. Alright, É I, É32700:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.259The Alliance: I'm gonna introduce you to Vika.32800:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.770The Alliance: you've gotÉ an assignment.32900:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.220Courtney Karnes: I got my home.33000:41:20.220 --> 00:41:33.210The Alliance: Between now and when we get together, and it's a Vipassana set slash creative microdosing. Just, like, run the three-week experiment for yourself, if you can, and É and report back, andÉ33100:41:33.750 --> 00:41:42.579The Alliance: By the way, last thought, we just saw the actual space, like, he finished the design, he finished the architecting it. Oh my god.33200:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.760Courtney Karnes: Wait, what space?33300:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.299The Alliance: In New York.33400:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.739Courtney Karnes: Oh, oh, oh, oh!33500:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.210The Alliance: God.33600:41:46.210 --> 00:41:46.660Courtney Karnes: Oh.33700:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.729The Alliance: I was, like, I mean.33800:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.460Courtney Karnes: If it doesn'tÉ.33900:41:48.460 --> 00:41:53.580The Alliance: maybe it doesn't look like the pictures, but I was like, holy shit! Like, one, it was, like.34000:41:53.670 --> 00:41:58.920The Alliance: crazy, like, swank in a weird, like, you know, I was like, wow, that's kind of funky, and that's really swank.34100:41:58.950 --> 00:42:15.030The Alliance: And I haven't actually seen anything that looks exactly like this before. I was reallyÉ I was blown away. I was like, okay, this is great. We could definitely do something here, and, you know, it'llÉ yeah, so I'm reallyÉ I think the space is gonna be really good, and the program seems to beÉ34200:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.700The Alliance: Coming together really, really, really well.34300:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.249Courtney Karnes: I can't wait. I'm sorry.34400:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.100The Alliance: It'll be fun.34500:42:21.100 --> 00:42:31.729Courtney Karnes: I'm psyched because I knowÉ I'm sad for my friends in the Alliance because their journey is different, but, like, I know that this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning for us, and that makes me very excited.34600:42:31.730 --> 00:42:38.629The Alliance: Well, there's aÉ I know we're gonna do a year-long alliance. I am gonna do that. It, É34700:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.859The Alliance: It won't be everybody, because it's gonna be pricey.34800:42:43.170 --> 00:42:49.960The Alliance: And I know that, intentionally. I'm pricey, but É We're gonna keep it going.34900:42:50.380 --> 00:42:58.510The Alliance: it'll be a better fit, I think, forÉ for what people want. Everybody keeps asking me for a book club, among other things, which I love.35000:42:59.100 --> 00:42:59.710Courtney Karnes: Okay.35100:42:59.870 --> 00:43:13.900The Alliance: And É I've wanted to do for a while anyways, and everybody's been asking for more science, which is great, because we can do that. So, like, I'm shaping it around, you know, things I'm hearing. You're working with me, so, like.35200:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.970The Alliance: If you can stay in the alliance or not, it's up to you.35300:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.060Courtney Karnes: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm like, I'm likeÉ35400:43:20.360 --> 00:43:29.889Courtney Karnes: I'm ready to go. I'm psyched. Okay, you've been on your thing. I appreciate you, thanks for the wisdom. It's fun to talk about me sometimes, and today was that, so thanks.35500:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.470The Alliance: It's reallyÉ it's tiring talking about me all the time.35600:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.400Courtney Karnes: Wow.35700:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.690Courtney Karnes: then that's why.35800:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.460The Alliance: The other thing, by the way, the last thing I want to say to you is, soÉ35900:43:39.700 --> 00:43:54.610The Alliance: when you're with me, if you start asking me endless, like, a lot of those questions, you have to stop at some point and, like, remind me, because I will slip into, oh, I'm on a podcast mode, or I will just keep talking.36000:43:54.620 --> 00:44:00.719The Alliance: Rather than being conversational, because I will switch into Professorio mode, and I won't notice.36100:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.080Courtney Karnes: Steven, you always poke me. I know how to manage all of this.36200:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.890The Alliance: Goodbye.36300:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.029Courtney Karnes: I enjoy it. Thank you. Have a good one.
