WEBVTT100:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.510Geof Garth: Hey! Hey!200:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.790The Alliance: Hi, Jeff!300:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.710Geof Garth: Let me change the sound here. You're coming through my speakers.400:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.040Geof Garth: Maybe turn that off.500:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.740Geof Garth: Okay.600:06:26.350 --> 00:06:34.410Geof Garth: Oh, thanks for the call. I had it on my schedule, which is, who isn't, isn't always the case.700:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.520Geof Garth: So I'm gonna see you800:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.499Geof Garth: Wednesday. I guess it is. Is it? Wednesday? Yeah. Wednesday.900:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.490Geof Garth: Hello!1000:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.400Geof Garth: Do we lose something?1100:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.399Geof Garth: Let me see.1200:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.849Geof Garth: Oh, come on, God damn it!1300:07:02.020 --> 00:07:10.090Geof Garth: Well, what I switch you from one speakers to the computer. My audio shows to be showing.1400:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.469The Alliance: Can you hear me?1500:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.719Geof Garth: Yeah. Now I can hear you.1600:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.353The Alliance: Oh, okay, that was weird.1700:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.830Geof Garth: Yeah, well, you and I always have weirdness when we try.1800:07:17.830 --> 00:07:28.316The Alliance: Right, we have weirdness with the electronics, for whatever reason. Alright, quick review. Since we have limited time. And yes, I'll see you this week. And you and tech that should be a fun conference.1900:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.069The Alliance: I was with a bunch of the people who are going to be there last weekend, and everybody was psyched. So I think it'll be fun.2000:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.160Geof Garth: Good.2100:07:36.825 --> 00:07:42.620The Alliance: Alright. So you've been assigned2200:07:42.740 --> 00:08:01.071The Alliance: a handful of process. I just want to do a quick accountability review. Just so we can get a sense of where you are the pasta creativity microdosing, and 4 different flow triggers to focus on plus any of the2300:08:01.860 --> 00:08:09.990The Alliance: Oh, goal setting stuff that you've been working through. How are all of those practices going for you?2400:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.989The Alliance: Are, are you? Are you using them all regularly, you leaning into all of them.2500:08:15.710 --> 00:08:21.599Geof Garth: Well, I've been doing the Vipassana but I got to a point where2600:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.970Geof Garth: I thought that.2700:08:25.090 --> 00:08:33.528Geof Garth: you know, going through the same thing repeatedly. I was, I tried to go back and find the gratitude2800:08:35.587 --> 00:08:48.532Geof Garth: podcast that you had recommended in one of the earlier versions in maybe 0 to dangerous where? You pick somebody who you wanted to2900:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.820Geof Garth: wanted to3000:08:51.690 --> 00:09:07.000The Alliance: So all of that, everything, including the love and kindness meditation, which is what you're talking about, is in the alliance workbook that we gave you at the start a breakdown of all those things and links are in the alliance workbook on the website.3100:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.140Geof Garth: Okay, I had a little bit of trouble.3200:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.619Geof Garth: Accessing the3300:09:17.070 --> 00:09:25.120Geof Garth: alliance. When I go online, it would just take me to the thing about signing up. If I put in flow alliance.3400:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.110The Alliance: It went.3500:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.530The Alliance: Elias Dot and Co.3600:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.729Geof Garth: Yeah, it just takes me to where, you know I'm trying to sign up.3700:09:32.464 --> 00:09:34.199Geof Garth: I found my way.3800:09:34.200 --> 00:09:47.940The Alliance: Let me let me let me. I'll get to get Ryan to call you afterwards, because I don't. I'm not website, Guru, so I won't be able to troubleshoot this with you, but I'll have Ryan call you as soon as, and configure.3900:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.749Geof Garth: Found my way back in in some situations, by going.4000:09:51.750 --> 00:10:02.849The Alliance: You're using the wrong link you you have the wrong link. You're using the old link that you got. You got sent initially. There's a second link that goes directly to the site.4100:10:03.220 --> 00:10:17.949Geof Garth: Yeah. And and I say, I found my way to that by linking onto something in the text, messaging the whatsapp messaging and stuff, but if I try and just go in, you know, in.4200:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.460The Alliance: That's weird.4300:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.690Geof Garth: Alright! So I.4400:10:19.690 --> 00:10:33.470The Alliance: Since I should make sure nobody else is having that problem. Because, yeah, all that stuff is in is is in the initial workbook which I spent 2 months building for you guys. So it'd be really good if everybody had access to it. Well.4500:10:33.510 --> 00:10:53.480The Alliance: right? Okay. So you've been using the past. And now there's a there's a a 4 month program there. With month one and 2 focusing on on the past stuff. Have you been doing it with creativity, Microdosing? Have you been drawing at all, or using the writing exercises.4600:10:54.120 --> 00:11:01.466Geof Garth: Yeah, I I did. I haven't gotten into the writing exercises. I I did a couple little drawings that I posted4700:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.635Geof Garth: the4800:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.370The Alliance: How did you find that.4900:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.679Geof Garth: You know it. It felt like a a task that I've been asked to do. So. I did it it!5000:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.470Geof Garth: You know I I was thinking that it was my understanding that5100:11:20.730 --> 00:11:28.790Geof Garth: those tasks were to help you sort of get back into flow to to overcome.5200:11:28.790 --> 00:11:40.329The Alliance: The the program is designed synergistically. It's not a mix and match, right? Everything is designed to work together. So the pasta is a creativity enhancing.5300:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.260The Alliance: Flow.5400:11:42.380 --> 00:12:06.500The Alliance: protocol, exercise, creativity. Microdosing is a release based exercise that builds different creativity muscles in the brain. So, as I said in the beginning, you can mix and match. But once you start mixing and matching, once you start doing exactly what you're doing, I like. There's no way I can say. Hey, Jeff, I think you're going to get the right results that you want out of this thing because you're5500:12:06.830 --> 00:12:26.209The Alliance: you. You've done a couple of Boston exercise. Then you went and did something else. You've done a couple of drawing exercises. Well, no, it was actually designed to be done every day, and a couple of times a week. I don't care. It's entirely up to you. But if you want to actually see what the program is designed to do, you actually have to do the program.5600:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.520Geof Garth: And and tell me what the program is designed to do.5700:12:31.960 --> 00:12:56.560The Alliance: Well, you came in very specifically. This is like this was your complaint, and you said, I've studied all these creativity things before I know them. They haven't changed. And I said, Yes, you're right. A lot of these basic things haven't changed. What has changed is our understanding of how they work in the brain and how they work together synergistically, and what starts happening when you start actively layering flow trigger work on top of creativity, work5800:12:56.640 --> 00:13:23.109The Alliance: on the possum work, and all of it is designed to amplify creativity in the brain, which ends up amplifying flow and amplifying motivation and productivity. And it all sort of works synergistically, it's a creative velocity accelerator. So the whole goal was to amplify creativity, innovation and that kind of energy forward. So that's how I was thinking, that's how it was designed to work.5900:13:24.410 --> 00:13:34.099Geof Garth: Well, that all sounds good. The the issue that I've had and what we talked about the last time was the6000:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.020Geof Garth: the massively transformative goal.6100:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.830The Alliance: Yet.6200:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.410Geof Garth: And then.6300:13:40.410 --> 00:14:02.609The Alliance: It seems like from go going looking at what your conversation with Ryan you've made progress that way. More so in that you've narrowed some stuff down in your life which is what it sounds like narrow, some commitment steps you could and you're going through a kind of a curious curiosity exploration phase which sounded like it was going well.6400:14:02.610 --> 00:14:10.770Geof Garth: Well, you, you and I talked about you and I talked about that the last time. But I have not had a conversation with Ryan.6500:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.230The Alliance: You didn't have a follow up call with Ryan yet.6600:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.170Geof Garth: No.6700:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.479The Alliance: Then, my, oh, that's weird. Okay, so that's so weird that he must have sent me.6800:14:25.320 --> 00:14:35.888The Alliance: He sent me this. Oh, yeah, he sent me the summary of our call. I just assumed it was your follow. So you haven't done a follow up call with Ryan, either, so you haven't scheduled any of those.6900:14:36.950 --> 00:15:03.499Geof Garth: And and the whole scheduling stuff. I felt like, well, maybe because I came in late. I didn't see that stuff, and I didn't see some stuff which I and Ryan sent me something, and he said, I sent you that on such and such a date. And so I went back, and I copied emails that came from Ryan on or around that date, and there was nothing there. And so I sent that back to him. And then I didn't hear anything back from him after that. So.7000:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.339The Alliance: Well, that's really weird. That doesn't sound like Ryan. But let me get into that.7100:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.725Geof Garth: Right. I I mean, I feel like I'm kind of on the outer edge here, and7200:15:12.000 --> 00:15:26.610The Alliance: Yeah. I well, as we were sweet, you should have had one follow up call with Ryan. Sort of an accountability call before before this call, just so we could run down some of the same stuff so that I've been running down just to sort of keep you on track right.7300:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.029Geof Garth: Well, you know. So7400:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.219Geof Garth: the curiosities that I came up with I mean, I had a hard time. I was unable to come up with 257500:15:36.260 --> 00:16:04.179Geof Garth: curiosities, you know, in part, because so much of my focus at this point is is on politics, on you know what Trump's doing, on how to stop that, etc. So I spend an inordinate amount of time focused on that. But the things that I came up with in terms of curiosities were, you know, the education for the high functioning kids how to enhance their intellect and their intuition creativity. And7600:16:04.290 --> 00:16:12.380Geof Garth: then a subset of that is, how can AI be most useful in that regard. The next thing I had listed was fly fishing, because it's something that I like7700:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.833Geof Garth: fishing for bass with streamers.7800:16:17.730 --> 00:16:25.079Geof Garth: And then creativity itself! How can I enhance my own creativity? How can I identify projects for myself?7900:16:25.530 --> 00:16:36.419Geof Garth: And then the next one was politics, ensuring that my values are reflected in the Us. Policy environmentalism issues woodworking.8000:16:36.620 --> 00:16:47.320Geof Garth: And that's what I came up with in terms of my curiosities, which struck me, as you know weak. You know you're talking about 25, and.8100:16:47.320 --> 00:16:56.159The Alliance: I don't believe you at all, Jeff, I said. 25 curiosities where you'd be willing to spend a weekend learning about it.8200:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.580Geof Garth: Yeah.8300:16:56.580 --> 00:17:19.040The Alliance: You spent a weekend learning how to build a robot that picks trash up off the beach like you spend more time than that, and I know that. And I know you did that this year. So I don't believe that you can actually like you're trying to come up with like a list of core passions. Perhaps that's not that. Wasn't that. But that strikes me as harder. You know what I mean like I was.8400:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.979Geof Garth: I'm having trouble.8500:17:19.980 --> 00:17:45.019The Alliance: That's a little hard like. That's a that's a big thing that you're trying to do, which is cool. But I was, I would and and with those sorts of things, how I would start subdividing because what you're really looking for, gruff like those are a great place to start, anyways, is, I would say, Okay, fly fishing is too big of a category. I want you to get a little more specific right.8600:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.299Geof Garth: I went that way.8700:17:46.300 --> 00:17:54.830The Alliance: Break it down into some subcategories and things like that, because what we're looking for is, where did these things start to intersect? And8800:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.850The Alliance: you know you don't have to like.8900:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.569The Alliance: I don't know how long it would take me, but like there's an intersection between fly fishing, woodworking.9000:18:06.020 --> 00:18:25.140The Alliance: trump policy towards the environment and creativity. Like, I already know, there's going to be some thing we could. We could find that sits between those 3 things so like the exercise is actually kind of working for you if you would like keep going with. But I think you're making it too hard on yourself.9100:18:25.180 --> 00:18:40.579The Alliance: I just would say, I said, start with stuff that you would spend a weekend learning about and like you wouldn't spend a weekend learning about the history of Edison, or like any like. Really, I used to be as a remarkably curious guy.9200:18:41.080 --> 00:19:01.770Geof Garth: Well, yeah, as it relates to that, I read an article the other day about these guys that are building motors that are based initially on Tesla's 1st motor design before the one that we use. And that's way. Smaller way, more powerful doesn't use rare Earth magnets9300:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.779Geof Garth: and is being produced now.9400:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.210The Alliance: So I sat there a lecture on off.9500:19:08.470 --> 00:19:20.120The Alliance: They've commercialized the Z machine. Do you know about this? What the Z machine is? It's the most powerful machine on earth. It's in Albuquerque. Sandia built it it. It turns9600:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.250The Alliance: oh.9700:19:22.420 --> 00:19:44.949The Alliance: force into power. And so there, like, it's interesting that you're saying that because I sat through like 3 different, really crazy lectures over the weekend last weekend on sort of exactly like new motors that are using different kinds of energy. Blah, blah, really interesting. There seems to be a lot of movement in this field. That's what I mean by like9800:19:44.950 --> 00:20:09.759The Alliance: new new motors. You would absolutely spend a weekend going to lectures on different kinds of new motors that goes on your list. That's what I mean by a curiosity. I don't. Don't give it that much weight, because what you're really looking for is where to like. 4 or 5 of your sort of smaller curiosities start to intersect, and is there something bigger there? But if you start with like, you know, a short 79900:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.980The Alliance: I don't necessarily know like you could do it. You know what I mean. We could find those intersections for you. It's just gonna be a little more challenging. I think.10000:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.870Geof Garth: All right. Well.10100:20:18.870 --> 00:20:39.880The Alliance: So, yeah, I think you like, take a little bit of the pressure off. But I also. But I here's the thing that I find super interesting is on your list of curiosities. Were all these things about kind of amplifying your own creativity? You're in a workshop designed to amplify creativity, but you don't want to do this stuff to amplify your own creativity.10200:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.720The Alliance: Well.10300:20:41.720 --> 00:20:58.289The Alliance: by the way, you're in a you're in a workshop where this most of the same stuff I'm doing would work with special needs kids, especially month 3, when we get into movement based protocols. Because that's where a bunch of them came from.10400:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.569Geof Garth: So should I go back and try and.10500:21:03.170 --> 00:21:24.970The Alliance: I just think you should just incorporate it in and see what happened like, I just want you to be curious enough to run the experiment in your own life and see what comes of it you may get into. You may do this for 3 months and be like you're fucking crazy. I'm just as creative as I was. It didn't work for me. I don't know what you're saying, and that would be a fair response. And then I would say, Jeff.10600:21:25.230 --> 00:21:32.187The Alliance: totally fair. Maybe, like we gotta find a different way to do this work with you. But you're super curious about it. But10700:21:33.870 --> 00:21:48.050The Alliance: I know. The only reason I mentioned all this stuff is because my stuff is about following the biology and using the synergistic biology like that's all I'm I'm building on. I'm not like there's no, you know, there's nothing sort of super fancy, as you know.10800:21:49.480 --> 00:21:49.920Geof Garth: Yeah.10900:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.630The Alliance: Little kitchen. By the way, is that your kitchen? Nice kitchen?11000:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.300Geof Garth: Yeah. Yeah.11100:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.560Geof Garth: Well,11200:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.099Geof Garth: So so help me out. What would you know? What would you advise me to be doing.11300:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.410The Alliance: I would I I would I like I would advise you to continue sort of just11400:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.459The Alliance: I. It seems like you're taking small steps. I would just like11500:22:14.130 --> 00:22:20.476The Alliance: I would be a little less precious and a little more experimental in your approach. Just a little bit.11600:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.863The Alliance: I think I don't know it11700:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.809The Alliance: It also sounds like you're you are having a little bit of fun along the way, too.11800:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.059Geof Garth: Well, that's always been a goal of mine.11900:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.760The Alliance: It's up like you're having fun along the way.12000:22:38.760 --> 00:22:55.890Geof Garth: One of the one of the things that I did was I use chat gpt because I'm trying to, you know. Actually, I think it was Gemini and I said, you know. Tell me everything you know about Jeffrey Garth, and then I had to work with it a little bit holy shit. I sound impressive when when Gemini is done.12100:22:55.890 --> 00:23:19.580The Alliance: Dude. Yeah, I've asked Chat tbt, to write my resume before my reaction was holy. Fuck. You're kidding like that was literally what I said, is holy fuck. You're kidding like I was like, if that's me, my work here exactly. It's so funny that you say that that was totally my experience. I was like holy crap, if that's true, and it wasn't like it was wrong, but I just never looked at it from that.12200:23:19.580 --> 00:23:26.549Geof Garth: Yeah, it was just all stacked one after the other, and how this related to that. And then how I use that to do this. And yeah, it was.12300:23:26.550 --> 00:23:33.579The Alliance: Yeah, it's kind of, I know I had that exact same experience. That's so funny. Yeah, that's funny that you have that. Yeah, I did, too.12400:23:33.580 --> 00:23:40.419Geof Garth: You know what I was trying to do was just use it on something that I knew, and when it gave me stuff that you know didn't.12500:23:41.365 --> 00:23:41.770The Alliance: Wasn't.12600:23:41.770 --> 00:23:51.860Geof Garth: Going in the right direction, or wasn't you know the focus was wrong? Then I would correct it, and then it would come back and give me, you know. So I am. I have been, you know, using AI.12700:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.960The Alliance: Tell me you don't have this feeling like.12800:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.510The Alliance: after using it for a while. I sort of feel like12900:23:56.900 --> 00:24:06.450The Alliance: it's like having an incredibly smart but still limited graduate student who works really fast.13000:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.970Geof Garth: I've I've never had any graduate students. But yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's13100:24:11.290 --> 00:24:22.873Geof Garth: yeah. It's it's gonna be more and more useful if we don't kill ourselves first.st But you know the did that that thing that wit put out13200:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.540Geof Garth: from his daughter his 14 year old daughter. Did you see that.13300:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.180The Alliance: I haven't seen it yet. He told me he did it.13400:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.800The Alliance: You want to go into that?13500:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.949The Alliance: He told me. He told me what he's doing, is it? Is it powerful?13600:24:34.350 --> 00:24:59.169Geof Garth: Yeah, I mean, she's just saying, Well, Dad, look, there's no concept of not using AI, because you know you, you Google something. And they give you an AI summary at the top that everybody everybody uses it. They don't necessarily use it the right way. Well, what is the right way? Well, you know, but it's it's short. You definitely want to listen to it, because it's like the true perspective of a kid about to go to high school13700:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.320Geof Garth: who sees AI being used by all 100% of her classmates for 100% of their projects.13800:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.880Geof Garth: Oh.13900:25:08.880 --> 00:25:26.560The Alliance: Well, yes and no. Right? So the question is is this, and I don't know what the answer to this is, but like it's only. If it hampers their learning right? We've said a lot about a lot of stuff along the way. So the question is.14000:25:26.880 --> 00:25:35.792The Alliance: a year from now. Are they smarter having used AI than they would be normally? Are? They bet right those are the questions.14100:25:36.410 --> 00:25:50.320The Alliance: that that I don't think we're looking at yet. And I'm not. I don't I? Again, it's as you just pointed out. So right it's are you using it right? You know what I mean. I use AI to do research all the time.14200:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.790The Alliance: But that doesn't. I'm gonna show you what. Just talking about this Mike Richards, ice officer doesn't14300:25:54.930 --> 00:26:05.540The Alliance: absolve me from having to go and read the original papers. You know what I mean like it could find me the papers a lot faster than I used to be able to find them myself. Right?14400:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.859The Alliance: Oh, yeah, for sure.14500:26:06.860 --> 00:26:24.362The Alliance: But it doesn't like I'm not letting it think for me. I gotta read the you know what I mean. I need to read the papers and do all that stuff. So I think that I think that's I think that's interesting. So I would. I would just keep leaning into the into the protocols.14600:26:24.890 --> 00:26:34.109The Alliance: but really, you know, try to expand those curiosities out and then, you know, start using. If you want AI like. By the way.14700:26:35.120 --> 00:27:00.539The Alliance: ask it. Just just try this. When we're done, take the list of curiosities that you've come up with. Feed them into chat, Gpt, and ask to show your gemini. Whatever say, where are the intersections? What are these fields overlap? You'll be surprised like you may find some stuff just in that alone where you're like. Oh, that's interesting. I never! I didn't. I didn't think that way. It's really worth sort of running those experiments because it's such a powerful.14800:27:00.828 --> 00:27:06.019Geof Garth: Remember you saying that that's 1 of the things it's good at is seeing those intersections and stuff.14900:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.250The Alliance: Well.15000:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.330Geof Garth: Would you?15100:27:09.530 --> 00:27:15.040Geof Garth: Would you suggest that I say, Okay, I'm gonna spend 2Êh every day on15200:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.190Geof Garth: the the discipline of of what we're talking about?15300:27:19.190 --> 00:27:32.499The Alliance: I would say. What I would do is I would pick a number. I don't know. I would do 90Êmin. I would do the 90Êmin uninterrupted block of complete, and I would spend at least an hour of that15400:27:32.810 --> 00:28:02.750The Alliance: feeding curiosities, playing with the things that you're interested in pushing them farther playing at those intersections, because I really believe that if you were to sort of do that, and and just what I'm trying to get you to do is just like relax enough to let your brain play at those intersections. And thus, with the drawing exercises sort of just boosting creativity a little, you know, all the things are just meant to like with guys at the top. You have to think about it this way. Also.15500:28:02.790 --> 00:28:09.710The Alliance: you're pretty creative. I mean, you know what I mean, like, we just talked about what your resume looks like. According to Gemini.15600:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.849The Alliance: Think about what happens15700:28:12.030 --> 00:28:27.269The Alliance: if you get a 1 to 2% boost. Right? That's the that's what people don't seem to get is that we're already sort of at the top of the profession. So if you crank up the knob a little bit. It's a really big deal for guys like us.15800:28:27.320 --> 00:28:42.409The Alliance: It's a lot more leverage than it. You know what I mean it's not. You don't have to move the needle really huge because of where we're starting from. Sure, if you're starting all the way at at the bottom with somebody who's never played with any of this stuff before. It's a much.15900:28:42.550 --> 00:28:48.529The Alliance: I mean, they'll have just as much fun. They'll get it. But once you're once you're sort of at a level16000:28:49.020 --> 00:28:55.710The Alliance: at the top level. You know what I mean like, you only want a handful of other additions. In a sense.16100:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.760Geof Garth: Yeah, well,16200:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.449Geof Garth: I'll16300:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.879Geof Garth: I'll try, because, you know, I want it all to work.16400:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.700The Alliance: You won all the awards. Is that what you said.16500:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.240Geof Garth: No, I want it all to work.16600:29:13.670 --> 00:29:21.109The Alliance: It's cool. Yeah, try try plan with this synergistically the mindfulness stuff.16700:29:21.320 --> 00:29:48.539The Alliance: I think I mean, you could progress through it. I think the most benefit is just if you can layer in a regular like I. Most of the time I use the same like I've done. I've done everything almost all the declutter that might take this course. I've checked out a lot of I go back to the same 15Êmin for Pasta, mindful that is my favorite one, because I think it's the perfect like. It's the perfect reset, the nervous system. Dose I know16800:29:49.030 --> 00:30:05.210The Alliance: some people get have really flowy meditate like I don't have that. I'm literally just calm down the nervous system. So I can stay inside the talent skills, sweet spot and access my creativity. So that, like. I literally. I keep the Norepinephrine out of the fucking way.16900:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.369The Alliance: cause I don't. I'm such a17000:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.629The Alliance: I don't know about you. I run17100:30:10.990 --> 00:30:28.469The Alliance: like I'm so used to stress. I don't even notice you know what I mean. I like, I just I can run through it, but I know it's limiting my access to creativity, because I know how stress works in the brain. So I reset the system, no matter what and what matters to me is consistency.17200:30:28.480 --> 00:30:58.035The Alliance: not the like, does it feel different? Because I already know, like, I know, what my system is sort of doing, anyway. So I'm just trying to like, stay ahead of it, where I notice is like, I skip like 4 or 5 days of meditation. Then I'm like, oh, I could feel it. I'm a little crankier. I'm a lot less creative. Then I start to notice, but I only noticed it after, like, you know, I have to be meditating every day for like a couple months, and then if I skip a half days, I'm like, oh, I see what it does to my mood. I see what it does, to my thinking17300:30:58.760 --> 00:31:07.439The Alliance: and that's 1 of the things that I think like I think there's some cool stuff that you could just unlock for yourself like, just by turning up the crank on regular consistency.17400:31:07.650 --> 00:31:20.870The Alliance: Well, so I would do it that way. And I literally like, when you're listing your 25 curiosities don't get precious about it. Get like it's almost whimsical, right? Like, if you're trying to think. Oh, I gotta list all the trump stuff17500:31:21.390 --> 00:31:38.309The Alliance: dude. I mean, right? I'm with you, I mean, I'm totally. I'm totally and it's like, by the way, I think that stuff is paralyzing to thought. Once my brain goes there, there's not a whole I like it shuts me down, for you know what I mean. If there's certain topics where I'm just like I don't know17600:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.770The Alliance: you're out.17700:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.969The Alliance: It's the fucking, silly show on television these days.17800:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.830Geof Garth: Yeah,17900:31:47.050 --> 00:31:56.169Geof Garth: do you? You said you get up and and go to work, because that, you know, works for you and stuff the what I have18000:31:56.330 --> 00:32:03.479Geof Garth: typically tried to do is to do the Vipassana, you know, the 1st thing in the morning.18100:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.570The Alliance: Like it.18200:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.670Geof Garth: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it. You know, I I18300:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.600Geof Garth: I like it. I I was just wondering if18400:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.709Geof Garth: doing it later in the day when I.18500:32:16.710 --> 00:32:17.330The Alliance: So.18600:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.309Geof Garth: Come stressed, or something.18700:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.080The Alliance: That's what I was good. So I have found some people like I use.18800:32:24.080 --> 00:32:51.559The Alliance: I want to get right into my uninterrupted concentration rock because I'm so you wake up at Alpha. That's creativity. That's right. Next to flow. I want to use that. You know what I mean. I don't want to like. I don't have to. I think meditation is for people who can't immediately like drop into work like, if you're gonna like, immediately drop into your cell phone in a million fucking meetings and like, do that. Then maybe you want my, I like to meditate at the end of the day.18900:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.030The Alliance: for sure it's the like I here's how. Here's how I use this stuff.19000:32:56.030 --> 00:33:22.049The Alliance: I get to the end of my work day and I have to transition. I gotta go back to my house to be with my wife. So I do a creativity, Microdose. I'll do a drawing before I have to go hang out with joy because it resets my nervous system and calms me down. It gives me a little bit of love. Dopamine is a little fun, so that way when I go interact with my wife. I'm not a bitch, and if she and then I,19100:33:22.090 --> 00:33:37.619The Alliance: after I interact with my wife at the end of the day she tells. This is all the other stuff I have to do that she you know what I mean. You have that conversation at the end of the day. Oh, this happened! Oh, we got it like after that conversation I go immediately and meditate. That's when I meditate.19200:33:37.620 --> 00:33:53.359The Alliance: because then my day is done. Everybody's loaded me up with everything, and I'm about as right. I'm out of energy. I'm about as stressed as I'm going to be. That's what I meditate then, and follow it with either like I usually do it in a sauna19300:33:53.420 --> 00:34:04.139The Alliance: boom, so I'll get into my sauna. I'll meditate, and then I'll read, and I'll get like a load of the pattern recognition system with new information that way. And you know all that. I'll do all that stuff at once.19400:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.980The Alliance: I find it's the most effective.19500:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.910Geof Garth: You wanna try it at the end of your day?19600:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.970Geof Garth: Yeah, I mean, I've been19700:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.750Geof Garth: I've been19800:34:15.100 --> 00:34:24.499Geof Garth: remodeling basically deferred maintenance on my house. So my hot tub has been, you know, out of action, for you know, the last19900:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.699Geof Garth: month, and it's not gonna be in action till I get back20000:34:28.929 --> 00:34:33.350Geof Garth: from the summer. Really, so that would be the ideal time to do it. But.20100:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.000The Alliance: Right.20200:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.079Geof Garth: Oh, but I'll I'll work around that.20300:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.340The Alliance: Okay?20400:34:38.926 --> 00:34:42.780The Alliance: Yeah. I think that I think that that's what. And we'll see you20500:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.120The Alliance: Tuesday. When do you get it? When Wednesday.20600:34:46.630 --> 00:34:54.150Geof Garth: Wednesday. Yeah, I'm I'm getting in Tuesday. I've got a friend that lives in Mellow Park. So I'm gonna go up and visit him and then come up20700:34:54.590 --> 00:35:05.440Geof Garth: Somewhat in advance. I had talked to a couple of people, I think Amity responded, about potentially having lunch together before the before your talk.20800:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.379The Alliance: Yeah, I well, I I told her, I'm gonna go over20900:35:09.580 --> 00:35:15.580The Alliance: to the event. Probably cause we get in I speak on Thursday, correct, or on Wednesday.21000:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.270Geof Garth: No, you speak on Wednesday.21100:35:17.270 --> 00:35:32.909The Alliance: Oh, that's right coming on Tuesday, so I I was gonna get there pretty early, just because there's I told Ryan I haven't exactly looked at who's speaking before me, but there might be one or 2 things and so I was just thinking about going to the event.21200:35:33.010 --> 00:35:33.490The Alliance: Well.21300:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.010Geof Garth: Yeah, well, I was kind of yeah. I'm back and forth.21400:35:37.400 --> 00:35:44.190Geof Garth: you know, Daniel Kraft is somebody that I met years ago at at Ted, and21500:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.610Geof Garth: he's a Md. And I don't.21600:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.450The Alliance: No, I know Dan. He's a good friend.21700:35:48.450 --> 00:35:48.780Geof Garth: Yeah.21800:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.530The Alliance: Friend.21900:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.840The Alliance: Cool, but.22000:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.990Geof Garth: But yeah, he goes off at 9, 30, and then.22100:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.960The Alliance: Oh! In the morning!22200:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.639Geof Garth: Yeah. Amity was talking about Dave Asprey at 1115 group panel.22300:36:00.640 --> 00:36:11.839The Alliance: Dave speaking to. Oh, it's all my friends. Oh, that's yeah. I guess I have to go and see all these guys. Damn! I didn't realize it was gonna be the whole posse. It's the whole fucking posse.22400:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.649Geof Garth: And then Thomas Thomas Incel.22500:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.879The Alliance: Oh, I think I met him, too. I yeah, he's not a he's not a friend, but I know that name.22600:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.550Geof Garth: Alright, so so.22700:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.470The Alliance: Yeah, so.22800:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.890Geof Garth: I'll try and do those.22900:36:24.890 --> 00:36:30.360The Alliance: And I and I. You know I don't know what we're getting in. I I my plan was to like, get in, you know.23000:36:31.160 --> 00:36:42.760The Alliance: Maybe meet with some people who want who want to grab dinner in the hotels. If anybody's around and I was, I mean, literally my plan was to wake up, work out and go to the conference kind of thing like after I got food.23100:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.570Geof Garth: Alright. And then then we're gonna have dinner that night. Yeah.23200:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.430The Alliance: Yep.23300:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.459Geof Garth: Yeah, okay. So I'm flying out on a red eye to go fishing.23400:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.190The Alliance: Are you really? Where are you? Gonna go?23500:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.630Geof Garth: Cape Cod.23600:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.960The Alliance: Oh, nice!23700:36:55.350 --> 00:37:00.820Geof Garth: You can. You can site cast to stripe stripers, striped bass, big fish.23800:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.800The Alliance: And kick her, and it's it there's a23900:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.479The Alliance: does it take fucking forever to get across that bridge onto that island in the in the summer. I'll bet it does.24000:37:08.820 --> 00:37:19.881Geof Garth: Yeah, it it can on the, you know, on the weekends and bad times to go and stuff. But the June, it doesn't really get heavy until July.24100:37:20.250 --> 00:37:20.889The Alliance: That. Okay.24200:37:20.890 --> 00:37:26.820Geof Garth: I'm usually there a week earlier than I would typically be there now, but24300:37:26.950 --> 00:37:31.679Geof Garth: delayed things. You know. So anyway, that's that's what.24400:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.470The Alliance: Can I ask you one last question before? I'm just curious. Have you ever vetted anything for phishing.24500:37:40.200 --> 00:37:57.212Geof Garth: Well, you'll get a kick out of this. I'm working on something right now. A particular fly, you know. My comment had been, you know fly fishing, and then I have a subset of that which I briefly mentioned, maybe in here, but fishing for bass with streamers.24600:37:58.100 --> 00:38:19.880Geof Garth: So streamers are subsurface, you know, typically people think about fly fishing only as landing that fly on the water surface. But most of the feeding of fish is done on subsurface. And so the striped bass are all subsurface. Well, not entirely. But yeah. And so24700:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.020Geof Garth: I've24800:38:21.290 --> 00:38:48.860Geof Garth: in my head. I've been designing, and I still I built a couple to put a degree of flotation in the fly with a sink, fishing it with a sink tip line. So, the point being that the sink tip line takes the thing down to the bottom, and when you strip it it pulls the fly down towards the sand, and then in between the strip, the fly comes up a little bit, and then you pull it again, and it tries to get back into the sand. So24900:38:49.530 --> 00:38:57.939Geof Garth: otherwise, you know, it just stays on the bottom and it moves along so I don't know but I'm hoping that this will stimulate, you know more action. So.25000:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.650The Alliance: More action.25100:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.859The Alliance: So it's it's tested. Cape Cod.25200:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.499The Alliance: yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely but.25300:39:04.890 --> 00:39:22.989Geof Garth: I gotta make this stuff before I go, because I don't have the tools, you know, but I'm in my shop with woodworking tools, and I had to figure out, okay, well, how do you make this phone piece to be the shape you want and the volume you need, and reliably do it, and what I've come up with is25400:39:23.220 --> 00:39:37.589Geof Garth: you mount it on a tube. Now you can hold this tube, this rigid, you know. Stick out the back. Now you can carefully turn it against your disc, Sander, if you hold it in a certain position. So I'm going through all the nitty, gritty.25500:39:37.590 --> 00:39:42.219The Alliance: Sounds like I like it sounds like a job, for like a micro lady, or something.25600:39:42.320 --> 00:39:48.790Geof Garth: Yes, except that the the yes. If you had a microlabe that that would work. But I don't.25700:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.290The Alliance: So.25800:39:49.290 --> 00:39:54.950Geof Garth: It's it's, I think, that this Sander is is the right tool. And what I.25900:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.519The Alliance: That's actually the right tool for the job.26000:39:56.520 --> 00:40:08.569Geof Garth: To keep it even. You let it grind into the aluminum stick that you're using a little bit, and that's gonna ensure that you've got the right taper, and then you can cut it off. So it's just, you know. I mean.26100:40:08.570 --> 00:40:13.680The Alliance: Once again. I say, I've never met a man more in need of a 3D printer than my friend Jeff.26200:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.719The Alliance: like Jesus, like literally, I've never met somebody who, like the thing is.26300:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.349The Alliance: you like 3D systems, need to sponsor you.26400:40:22.350 --> 00:40:28.364Geof Garth: The the to to use a 3D. Printer. You've got a a program. You gotta.26500:40:28.740 --> 00:40:36.960The Alliance: I know I know this is you appreciated the choir. I told you I don't know. I know. It's and it's getting. I mean?26600:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.329The Alliance: Here's the question, how how far are we away from26700:40:43.310 --> 00:41:05.089The Alliance: voice activated chat Gbt driven 3D printers right once they're there, guys like you and me are going to go crazy because we got all the imagination in the world. We just don't. I'm like you. I don't know if I'm like you on this, but I don't want a new tool one. I don't want a new tool if I can't master it, because I like to master my tools.26800:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.600The Alliance: 2 I'm a slow adopter.26900:41:09.020 --> 00:41:21.589The Alliance: I'm very cautious. I got a lot of shit. I don't need new tools. My tools work just fine, so like you gotta prove to me that your tool isn't gonna break something that currently works for me before I'm gonna adopt it.27000:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.105Geof Garth: Yeah, yeah, no. I27100:41:25.090 --> 00:41:43.210Geof Garth: I just as as I was saying that it was like, well, they're already saying that you don't need to code anymore. You just tell it what you want to do. So can't you know somebody needs to be putting that together to where I want you to make a tapered piece. That's this dimension that you know. And27200:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.790Geof Garth: okay.27300:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.819The Alliance: By the way, so that like27400:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.719The Alliance: that would do something that probably exists.27500:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.539The Alliance: That's what I'm thinking27600:41:51.540 --> 00:42:08.370The Alliance: exist like I can't believe it doesn't exist, especially because, like inventors are inventing this shit. And this is the 1st thing an inventors go like invent is a tool for invention. Right? Like a tool making tool is worth more than almost anything else. As Kevin Kelly pointed out.27700:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.429Geof Garth: Yeah. Yeah.27800:42:10.550 --> 00:42:16.209Geof Garth: Well, I I sent an article off to a friend of mine that they just came out with27900:42:16.630 --> 00:42:45.008Geof Garth: with these hands. That are $6,000 instead of 15 to $25,000 that have unbelievable, improved performance, sensation, rotatable thumbs, all kind of stuff, and that they can. 3D. Print. So I sent this to him. This guy is is a wonderful photographer, I mean, you know, world class was on the cup. His his image was the cover of, You know,28000:42:45.660 --> 00:42:54.560Geof Garth: some fun magazine years ago moved into video production. You might know some of these guys, the Bones Brigade. And those video.28100:42:54.560 --> 00:42:54.920The Alliance: Yeah.28200:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.320Geof Garth: Came out. Well.28300:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.280The Alliance: I know all those just well, I don't know super well, but I know that.28400:42:59.560 --> 00:43:06.459Geof Garth: He, Stacy Peralta, was his buddy, and he made the 1st videos that went from selling 500.28500:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.950The Alliance: To 5.28600:43:07.950 --> 00:43:14.999Geof Garth: 1,000 videos and so and then he trained himself to evolve.28700:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.009The Alliance: He didn't make this search for animal chin, did he?28800:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.170Geof Garth: Video of all time. No search for animal chip, no.28900:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.379The Alliance: Do you know what I'm talking about.29000:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.410Geof Garth: No, but I'm gonna write it down.29100:43:26.700 --> 00:43:35.509The Alliance: It's the we talked about. I talked about it. I want to say in Rise of Superman, because it was the first.st You know what the big deal about skateboard videos were.29200:43:36.830 --> 00:43:38.290The Alliance: They were structured?29300:43:38.530 --> 00:43:55.219The Alliance: Yeah, until that point, right? Like you could do it if you tried to learn this, try fucking, learning, an Owli, looking at a picture in a magazine. You're like, what's he doing to this? Eel? What? Huh? But once we had video, we were like, stop, pause, rewind, freeze! Oh, that's how that goes!29400:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.886Geof Garth: Well, yeah, he29500:43:59.650 --> 00:44:12.369Geof Garth: I'll send you a couple of links to the videos that he created. But but Powell Peralta were the was the company that was putting out these 1st videos. And29600:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.499Geof Garth: yeah, he had a thing with a cop busting some guy for weak ollies.29700:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.699Geof Garth: Right? It just all kinds of stuff.29800:44:22.700 --> 00:44:28.069The Alliance: That's funny. That's terrible skating uber. But I think I find that funny.29900:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.600Geof Garth: Yeah.30000:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.960The Alliance: Alright. I gotta jump.30100:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.760Geof Garth: Okay.30200:44:31.760 --> 00:44:39.460The Alliance: Keep going with the creativity stuff. I would see what happens if you give it an hour a day and layer on the other stuff. And I'm gonna have Ryan call you today.30300:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.950Geof Garth: Yeah, I saw there's something came in from him while we were talking, so I don't know.30400:44:43.950 --> 00:44:50.079The Alliance: Oh, cool, alright gonna bug him right now, Jeff. Thank you, Buddy.
