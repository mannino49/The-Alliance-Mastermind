WEBVTT100:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.590Rick Sessinghaus: Hey! Steven.200:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.690The Alliance: Hi, Rick, how are you?300:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.780Rick Sessinghaus: Wonderful! You.400:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.229The Alliance: I'm great. Thank you.500:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.700Rick Sessinghaus: Alrighty!600:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.740The Alliance: T let's jump in if you're cool. With that, you bet. Alright so I am guessing.700:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.510The Alliance: View went through the the full. 1st onboarding the digital800:02:20.931 --> 00:02:27.290The Alliance: I know you you guys were all in the room, and then you cut out. Did you get a chance to get to the second half the the last bit.900:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.140The Alliance: Did you watch the end of it, or did you say? Were you there the whole time?1000:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.405Rick Sessinghaus: I was not I. I was on the road. We had the PGA championship.1100:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.490Rick Sessinghaus: that I was at with my client, my my students. So I just watched everything after the fact.1200:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.210The Alliance: But you got it at you. You're through it all awesome. Did you? Check out the digital pop up with Sarah.1300:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.089Rick Sessinghaus: I did. So I watched that on video.1400:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.131The Alliance: Oh, cool. Yeah. Oh, cool.1500:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.700The Alliance: 1st question I. My approach is always arm every with all all the information1600:03:05.120 --> 00:03:16.180The Alliance: fire hoses, especially in the beginning, and one of the reasons I like the fire hose approach, whereas we'll tend. We'll slow things down, you know, sort of from here on out is. I want to see what sticks.1700:03:16.180 --> 00:03:40.929The Alliance: There's no way everything could possibly stay like. It's like, you're crazy, right? But a couple of things are going to really land. Stay with you. Maybe you've actualized them. Maybe that to change it already, or they've at least stuck with you. And I always think that's a great like. It's very telling, for all the obvious dopamine adult reasons. Right? As a great place to start this discussion. So before we sort of jump into the stuff that you brought to the table1800:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.420The Alliance: that we can work on. What stuck out at you? What's in your mind right now? What questions do you have.1900:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.710Rick Sessinghaus: So because I was a professional athlete back in the day, and I coach a lot of elite performers. Routines is always something that's been embedded in me for a long time.2000:03:56.080 --> 00:04:08.539Rick Sessinghaus: When I start to look, is the routine actually leading to the state I want to be in, or the behavior I want to be in. I have to kind of zoom back out and say, Why are you doing this, Rick? In the 1st place, is it actually leading to anything.2100:04:08.740 --> 00:04:20.780Rick Sessinghaus: and I frame it that way because doing the new type of meditation that you brought, I've done forms of meditation for a long time, however, I found that I was getting2200:04:21.600 --> 00:04:34.050Rick Sessinghaus: lazy might be the wrong word, but too dependent on guided meditations and guided visualizations. So there was always a voice there to keep me reconnected, reconnected. And so now, when there's a lot of space2300:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.119Rick Sessinghaus: It improved my awareness.2400:04:39.340 --> 00:04:58.449Rick Sessinghaus: and it all, I mean. Yes, my mind jumps. But then I was going. Well, wait a second. What is this exercise? Again? Awareness, and then back to breath. And it's definitely going to be what I utilize for the foreseeable future, and of course they can always adjust later. So that was one thing is that the meditation practice2500:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.630Rick Sessinghaus: was actually more beneficial for me than.2600:05:00.630 --> 00:05:09.310The Alliance: You're you're the. You're not the 1st person who said this, who I've talked to in the group. A couple. I'm so happy2700:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.059The Alliance: I'm just gonna like2800:05:11.580 --> 00:05:22.230The Alliance: I've meditated for 30 years. I've used lots of different systems, everything that you could possibly freaking. Imagine. I'm sure you're the same way. And when I sort of stumbled upon2900:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.029The Alliance: it's the it's shins and Young's3000:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.999The Alliance: teachings that this guy trained under like. And it's3100:05:30.340 --> 00:05:59.479The Alliance: you're like, Oh, this system is really. And when you get like one level, deeper and hopefully, at some point, we'll talk about it with Shinzhen like literally breaks all awareness down into 6 experiences. So the labeling gets like, it's really a freaky thing when you're like, Oh, shit! There are only 6 possible experiences on this planet that I can have, and everything is a combination of like one through 6. It's a really you're like, because they talk about Shinzhen always says the point of meditation is3200:05:59.700 --> 00:06:10.122The Alliance: this kind of meditation. It's like cleaning a desk, right? You make your desk clean before you start working, because it declutters the mind. That's that's so. I have found.3300:06:10.630 --> 00:06:37.569The Alliance: it's extraordinary. And I've also found I don't know if you've discovered this, my experiences, and maybe you guys haven't been doing it long enough, but I've been meditate for a long time, and I always found it was like a like a useful tool to have in the kit, but it was never a go to in times of crisis. This system allows me. I don't care what happens. During the day. I literally can reset my brain and get a good night's sleep in 15 min at the end of my day. That's crazy to me. That's so much power.3400:06:38.970 --> 00:06:55.940Rick Sessinghaus: 100, I think most of the time I utilize meditation. In the morning I was on the road to where I had a little more time, like I'm in a hotel room that I did at morning, and then in evening, like maybe 20 min before I'm going to sleep and my sleep. I wear an aura ring, and I got all the data.3500:06:56.100 --> 00:07:12.219Rick Sessinghaus: It was actually a very good week of sleep, even though I was on the road. Now, is it because of that? Maybe maybe it's because some other things, but to utilize it on both of those spots during the day, I think, was important. And because my mind and I know it's a lot with people is, it's3600:07:12.350 --> 00:07:27.280Rick Sessinghaus: racing to a lot of different things, not necessarily negativity, like anxiety, like what's going to happen but problem solving. And I have a lot of clients and in golf nowadays. And this is, I don't want to get on a side note. But I do want your advice on this.3700:07:28.290 --> 00:07:40.559Rick Sessinghaus: We now through the damn phone. We have the leaderboards that are updated every minute, and I know how my clients are doing throughout the world in any one time.3800:07:40.780 --> 00:07:52.010Rick Sessinghaus: and me reacting to they're doing really well. Yay, and then they're doing crappy. Oh, no right, and yes, I can remove myself and not look at it as much. That's I get that part.3900:07:52.170 --> 00:08:04.830Rick Sessinghaus: The reactivity to other people's results has affected me in the last 6 months a lot, and people are hiring me to improve their games, and if their scores don't get better, then I look at that as a reflection of me.4000:08:05.070 --> 00:08:16.019Rick Sessinghaus: why I use it in this case is that last week was a very stressful week for my player for me. But I using this technique, I think. Got me some space between. That4100:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.320Rick Sessinghaus: is is where it wasn't about. Oh, my God! I got to figure this out. It's like, wait a second, Rick.4200:08:20.570 --> 00:08:38.099Rick Sessinghaus: just freaking. Do some breathing. Get a get? Get that lens a little further away from it. So I'm using that as a specific example of where I'm going to use it in the future. When I find I get a little bit attached to what my clients are doing, because I can check in real time, or they're texting me. Hey? I did this.4300:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.539Rick Sessinghaus: That's been a little bit of a blocker for me lately.4400:08:42.110 --> 00:08:52.190The Alliance: Yeah, I've got what we'll. We'll let's come back to that. Because I I mean, I got some questions. Maybe some ideas. Who knows? The the pasta was the 1st thing. What else has stuck with you?4500:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.810The Alliance: Anything.4600:08:53.094 --> 00:09:05.340Rick Sessinghaus: And I may have. I may have framed it a little bit in the for our 1st little call, but so, having kind of the microdose of flow, or the transition from one event to the next being the sketching and stuff is4700:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.649Rick Sessinghaus: fascinating for many reasons. One, as I have a limiting belief that I am an awful artist.4800:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.208Rick Sessinghaus: Okay? And my, my, my4900:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.370Rick Sessinghaus: kids. My wife always makes fun of me when we play pictionary, because it's just awful.5000:09:21.600 --> 00:09:30.420Rick Sessinghaus: and they love making fun of me. And now when I sold them, hey, I'm doing this, they go. Oh, this will be good, right, and I've noticed when I've done it, let's say 5 times.5100:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.919Rick Sessinghaus: Getting it better is actually not the thing it's the the less analytical of is this, good or bad.5200:09:39.250 --> 00:09:45.189Rick Sessinghaus: and that's again been able to kind of zoom back out. It's like it doesn't freaking matter if it's good or bad.5300:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.220The Alliance: Well, the other thing you start to think the other thing people start to figure out is.5400:09:51.260 --> 00:10:04.009The Alliance: there's a bunch of ways to make art. You can make art that looks like the thing you're looking at. And that's fine. There's this photo realism, or whatever the fuck it is. But I so what's really funny about me is like.5500:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.639The Alliance: unless you're a real, actual, talented artist.5600:10:07.890 --> 00:10:33.959The Alliance: I make art that looks like art because I'm really creative. So even though I can't get the outline of the buildings to look anything like that. I know I got a good sense of like. Where should I shade? And where should I put tiny little feet, features, and not so I can make something with sort of minimal squiggles on page that actually kind of looks like art. So even if I don't get the satisfaction of oh, like this, look like I get the satisfaction of holy fuck.5700:10:34.040 --> 00:10:47.963The Alliance: I made something that's actually pleasing or interesting to look at. I did this Whoa! I just I mean I you know I love what it does for you, but I love that you're you're excited by that. I was. That makes me really happy, too.5800:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.589The Alliance: I talked to somebody else who's ever talked to Bruce yesterday, and he's also he's been like5900:10:54.090 --> 00:11:05.589The Alliance: sort of same thing, like he's a terrible he thinks. Always thought of some of the terrible artist, and really not like. And he's having. He's a lot having a lot of fun with it. I'm so glad I love. I love those exercises.6000:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.709Rick Sessinghaus: And it goes back to, you know, the challenge skills balances that I've had a perception that6100:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.979Rick Sessinghaus: drawing is this super super high, challenging thing which puts me in an anxiety thing.6200:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.330The Alliance: Right.6300:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.490Rick Sessinghaus: It's gonna suck. And now I'm looking at is that nobody even has to see this?6400:11:21.740 --> 00:11:46.829Rick Sessinghaus: And what would it be like to be playful and creative, and just see what that experience is, because I do that with my golfers is that we try to create the craziest shots around trees around this stuff, and whether you succeed or not is actually not the point. It's it's the the mindset behind that shot that it is. And I just noticed myself, maybe the 1st time there was a little controlling, and then by the 3rd time, it's like fuck it. And then that opening up is like, oh.6500:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.810Rick Sessinghaus: that actually was a decent spot of this! And then but it was more of just letting my mind6600:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.060Rick Sessinghaus: get out of my mind, which is something that.6700:11:55.060 --> 00:12:03.220The Alliance: Let's see. Yeah. Well, there's there's 3. There's 3 things I'm teaching you right, like, there's the creativity skills. And there's but there's an actual6800:12:03.450 --> 00:12:26.619The Alliance: that you'll notice that the focusing skill you need to get out of your mind and actually draw along with the dude. It's essentially the same focus that you need for flow. Right? It's the same focus. And that focus is so hard to train. Meditation is too rigorous. Right like the Vipassana watch. Your breath is actually tighter than a flow focus.6900:12:26.920 --> 00:12:38.289The Alliance: It's more work than a flow focus, right? Flow. Focus is very dynamic and engaging. And all that. So the only I've so the only time I find you can get to flow, focus and meditation is with them, doing like a7000:12:38.420 --> 00:12:59.080The Alliance: a really quiet to bed and bell meditation, where you're trying to listen to all the tones, and as it disappears it goes. And you can sort of because you're tracing a dynamic system. You can sort of have it. But I find that drawing is actually like this is, it's a flow, focused training skill, disguised with a lot of other things, too.7100:13:00.510 --> 00:13:12.810Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, no, I like that again, I have a question that will relate to that later about utilizing this with my clients, and how you frame that with that, it's actually training a a form of focus7200:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.120Rick Sessinghaus: one, because you have to create like7300:13:15.260 --> 00:13:22.480Rick Sessinghaus: any athlete has to create their performance in a way. Yes, some of it's reactionary. But golfers can definitely be in control of that.7400:13:22.870 --> 00:13:36.670Rick Sessinghaus: And then we're perceiving something that's happening in the future. So we can use visualization, which is a form of art, like I said, here's a canvas. Now create it with that shot. But you you just said something about the I'm sorry. The narrowness of focus.7500:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.340The Alliance: So flow is a flow. So7600:13:41.050 --> 00:13:47.889The Alliance: it's interesting. And this hasn't. So when we're meditating, you're totally like focusing on this tip of your nose like7700:13:49.320 --> 00:13:56.789The Alliance: there is, unless and even that, unless you're a a target shooter, basically.7800:13:56.890 --> 00:14:24.609The Alliance: there is no other activity in the world where the focus is gonna be like that sort of consistency, even like for a golfer. Right? The only time you want that laser point focus is really when the club heads, it's it's the ball, but it's it's not a fluid thing you like. Your focus has to shift all the way through the swing, and it's got to be wide because you have to somehow be able to tell where are my hips in line with the club head and my neck like you're doing a thing that is much bigger than a like a pinpoint focus. So7900:14:24.690 --> 00:14:37.100The Alliance: it's much more similar to the focus you use in drawing. So the I have not I use. I'll use drawing. I'll use these. I'll do a micro drawing session if I have to do an afternoon writing session8000:14:37.390 --> 00:14:47.609The Alliance: hard to get back into flow a second time, especially about a good flowy writing session in the morning. You know, I can use this and sort of cheat my way into that focus8100:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.590The Alliance: and then start writing because it's similar.8200:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.279The Alliance: Now, is it gonna work with?8300:14:54.550 --> 00:15:05.440The Alliance: It's not. You know what I mean like? I don't know, because it's like it may be too distracting for some of the athletes, or they might like, you know what I mean. But there's probably a couple who are gonna react really well to it.8400:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.120Rick Sessinghaus: Yes, and not, and not to again8500:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.979Rick Sessinghaus: divert to something else, but more and more. What I'm seeing with athletes is8600:15:13.240 --> 00:15:30.530Rick Sessinghaus: one of the major blockers, for instance, is obviously they're in their head. It's highly analytical, highly critical. And they're now because we have so much more information about how to move the club and move your body. They're becoming hypergen on, on8700:15:30.670 --> 00:15:45.559Rick Sessinghaus: how they should do things at 42 degrees, and this that and the other thing. And they're losing the essence of. I got to get that damn golf ball over there, and it can be done many different ways. And so when I can get anybody outside of that internal chatter.8800:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.399Rick Sessinghaus: It's it's a win.8900:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.399Rick Sessinghaus: And so.9000:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.830The Alliance: Right? Yeah, I mean I I it's I don't track anything9100:15:54.550 --> 00:16:08.330The Alliance: literally. I don't track it. I don't wear an aura. I don't wear a whoop. I don't do any of it. I have a really great internal sense of things, but I found that, like none of that app, it helped short term to sort of get a9200:16:08.500 --> 00:16:19.090The Alliance: baseline to like. Oh, this is where that this is what that feels like. But then I put it away. I don't want it. I don't like I find all that stuff. A hindrance.9300:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.650The Alliance: I don't.9400:16:21.430 --> 00:16:38.909Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah. And yet we have these athletes who now have been bombarded with you have to measure every single thing, and you have to take a blood test and everything's measured. So we can look at data. And we can look at you know how to optimize. And that makes sense logically. But when they lose their9500:16:41.330 --> 00:16:47.180Rick Sessinghaus: the gut feeling the intuition, the you know. That's when I think it's starting to go.9600:16:47.180 --> 00:17:01.929The Alliance: No, I mean, I think you this. This is the same problem with AI brands and efficiency engine. So the Google effect is, if you can look up information, you won't memorize it. You won't learn it right? This is essentially the Google effect.9700:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.870The Alliance: They don't have to9800:17:04.319 --> 00:17:20.480The Alliance: know how their body feels they can externalize it. So they're absolutely losing that awareness. That's why I won't use these things like you'll blind yourself. And it's why I'm really careful with how I use AI, because same reason.9900:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.219Rick Sessinghaus: I'm not gonna let the machine make me stupider.10000:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.920Rick Sessinghaus: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense.10100:17:27.089 --> 00:17:33.439The Alliance: Alright! What can what? We create a microdose and pause anything else? Or should we get to your your stuff.10200:17:36.070 --> 00:17:46.830Rick Sessinghaus: I have not dug in deep enough to with my goals. So that's something I'll be working on in the next couple of weeks. When you know we said this, okay, what is this? This10300:17:46.850 --> 00:18:11.520Rick Sessinghaus: masterpiece that you know when I 1st got involved with it? And then I shared that. I'm working on a software thing for an AI for me on golf simulators that's still going. And I have a team. I have to rely on that. Does a brunt of the work. I'm writing a second book. So that's something I'm it's I think the overall is me being back to Rick a creative instead of Rick just trying to do a bunch of freaking projects because they're opportunities.10400:18:11.690 --> 00:18:21.059Rick Sessinghaus: And I've been fortunate in the last few years that there's been a ton of opportunities for me and my company, but that's gotten me further away from being fulfilled of10500:18:21.270 --> 00:18:34.169Rick Sessinghaus: creating content and looking at things differently, and because I feel like I do a good job in my industry of taking these complex ideas of the mental game and and performance, and shrinking them down to go. Oh, that makes sense. And then people are.10600:18:34.700 --> 00:18:42.789Rick Sessinghaus: So that's I. It's so I need to get clear on. I think I have like the massive massive. It's it's the.10700:18:43.650 --> 00:18:52.400The Alliance: What do I need to do today? This minute? I have challenges creating boundaries in my schedule. So I tend to overschedule.10800:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.859Rick Sessinghaus: This this one, we're gonna so.10900:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.949The Alliance: I'm so glad you're you're here. This is awesome.11000:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.898The Alliance: he says, and the reason is,11100:19:04.100 --> 00:19:13.000The Alliance: If I could start us all over again, if I could roll back the clock. I don't know if I do anything different. But here's what I would do. Different session. One11200:19:13.360 --> 00:19:23.010The Alliance: could have been entitled Creative Pathfinding, rather than like11300:19:23.570 --> 00:19:39.090The Alliance: starting you deep in the creativity weeds to accelerate creativity. I think we got us like, I think, almost everybody in the group, with with literally one exception, of the people I've talked to, and I think I have 2 more, one on one calls. So it's like, you know.11400:19:39.230 --> 00:19:53.159The Alliance: or 13 of you already. everybody has sort of got up. And actually, even this guy. The guy I'm thinking about. Everybody's got a bunch of like creative path finding stuff. So11500:19:53.730 --> 00:20:20.879The Alliance: we're gonna actually cover. I'm gonna give you the like, we covered it. But I didn't put it together as a single unit for you guys, we're gonna do that actually to kick off the next class. But I'm gonna give you a homework assignment because I think this is gonna help you tremendously on everything you just sort of said. So I it's it's a protocol I use you, and it's great. If you have a, you have a massively transformative purpose. You know what that is. And you you're pretty clear, like11600:20:21.080 --> 00:20:29.430The Alliance: I heard goals. You've even identified the 2 primary right? Primary is the AI secondary is the book right? And11700:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.580The Alliance: probably the 3rd is, keep all the coaching clients happy. Right, keep keep.11800:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.040Rick Sessinghaus: Correct.11900:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.210The Alliance: Business right like this has got to be like priority, and 4 or one depending on how things are going, is12000:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.030The Alliance: happy, right? Like.12100:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.590Rick Sessinghaus: There you go!12200:20:43.590 --> 00:21:05.215The Alliance: Right. Keep life happy. You hope it could be 4. You hope that there's enough space this week that it could be 4. Sometimes it has to be one right in my experience. Maybe your marriage is different, but that's been my, that's been my experience. So you're in a really great spot. And the the 1st place I would tell you to start. The 1st thing I would you want to do is12300:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.260The Alliance: identify the 100 steps between.12400:21:11.810 --> 00:21:17.389The Alliance: like the you have an AI version of Rick. That's where we're going to be out of step 100.12500:21:17.390 --> 00:21:42.470The Alliance: So we know, for example, along the path. There's just certain obvious stuff. Well, there's a bunch of fucking marketing. Once the thing gets built, there's a marketing step. So you're gonna look at that and be like, okay, there's 10 marketing steps here and you're gonna be. There's a bunch of recording steps right? I still need to be shot to do that blah blah. And then there's gonna be a bunch of editing, you know, whatever there's obvious stuff you can see, and don't even worry about sequencing it just yet. Just.12600:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.870Rick Sessinghaus: Okay.12700:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.793The Alliance: What are the 100 steps? And the whole point here is12800:21:48.500 --> 00:22:01.680The Alliance: make as much shit visible as possible. One. So you don't get blindsided 2 months from now, when you get to like, the next thing you think is to do, and you realize, oh, shit! This thing is like 30 steps long. It's not12900:22:01.810 --> 00:22:16.180The Alliance: marketing, it's oh, fuck! And it's gonna take 6 months. And why didn't I get out ahead of it? And blah! Blah! Let's get out ahead of it. Let's visualize all of it, right? And what I, and depending on how you you like to work with this.13000:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.960The Alliance: Okay, not only13100:22:20.220 --> 00:22:30.100The Alliance: should that not have rung. But I don't know anybody in Laos like whatever else is going on. Nobody's ever called me from Laos before. That was really weird.13200:22:30.820 --> 00:22:36.357The Alliance: Huh? Okay, that international calling plan. Anyways,13300:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.539The Alliance: make as much stuff is visible as possible. Fill in all the gaps at some point.13400:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.170The Alliance: You can show it to friends like, Hey, did I miss anything in this picture? Do you see anything in here?13500:22:48.470 --> 00:23:02.109The Alliance: I usually like? It usually grows to more than a hundred sort of thing, but it's usually ends up being big, really big. And I do the same thing for the book. Each of the higher goals gets like the 100 steps in the book, is the marketing of the book and everything you can see.13600:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.050The Alliance: and once you get it, all that done the next.13700:23:07.410 --> 00:23:20.640The Alliance: This is exactly how you write a book, right? The next thing you do is put it in order. What's first? st What's second, what's 3? rd Right? And then you have literally a hundred steps in an order. And you asked, How do I figure out what goes on? My clear goals list13800:23:21.060 --> 00:23:37.798The Alliance: the next step right like. That's literally how you do it. And the other thing. Sometimes I tell people to do this, you're it doesn't seem like this is an issue for you, but it could be useful for you as a filter.13900:23:40.470 --> 00:24:02.770The Alliance: I, when I assess, projects I have a big category that is like all the things I'm passionate about like where I know it's gonna hold my attention, and more, and all my predilections who the fuck I am and how I exactly like to live, because it doesn't matter what's on my fantasy list. People have a mistaken idea, and it's 1 of the14000:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.450The Alliance: craziest things with peak performance. I'm sure you've seen it a bunch of times that if14100:24:07.630 --> 00:24:13.460The Alliance: achieve my mission goal or even my high heart goal, I'm going to be somebody different14200:24:13.990 --> 00:24:41.150The Alliance: and capable of living a different life. And you're not like you're the same fool if you're an extreme introvert who needs to take naps during the day after you come in contact with people that doesn't go away just because you XY or Z, right like. So people fail. What I always tell people is, in a sense, what you want to do is you want your 100 steps, and then you want to filter through who you are14300:24:41.310 --> 00:25:09.140The Alliance: right, and one that tells you who what to outsource like, what are, where your fault like? What? What are you absolutely not gonna want to do? It's gonna be demotivated when it shows up you're gonna if you don't have the money to outsource for it. Saved like, it's gonna be a problem. All that stuff. So like, get yourself as a problem out of the equation by like. So my assignment to you is like a hundred steps on the on the on the AI14400:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.310The Alliance: 100 steps on the book.14500:25:12.840 --> 00:25:22.679The Alliance: and you know all, everything, personality wise you can sort of get, and then just start cross mapping and and and put them in order of things. And that's like14600:25:23.120 --> 00:25:44.150The Alliance: this is not. These are not small tests. So I'm almost like load to give you anything else to do like like that with your schedule. That may that like, plus the stuff you already do, that may be more than enough. I'm happy to give you more if you want to load you up. But, like those 2 things I would like, you really want to start with, because it'll give you what the other thing that you need, which is what the fuck should you say? No to.14700:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.059Rick Sessinghaus: Okay, so you already. Now you're answering my.14800:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.930The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, yeah.14900:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.479Rick Sessinghaus: So I mean, this is helpful, and and15000:25:53.570 --> 00:26:18.110Rick Sessinghaus: I have made the mistake multiple times. I've not learned my lesson yet is yes, I say yes to a lot of things. One. There's a a wanting to please people. I know some of my personality traits on that. I want to help people I want to. You know it's a high value for me, and if I say no, I'm rejecting them. So I understand some of the concepts there. The other thing is, I do say yes to things that I do align with that is going to help my company and such.15100:26:18.110 --> 00:26:37.329Rick Sessinghaus: But I'm so excited to say yes, because it's such a cool opportunity that I've said yes before I've even done. What are 20 steps, much less a hundred steps, that I need to do. And then I go shit like my company. We're going to get into tennis. We're getting into performing arts. We're getting into some other elements which excites me. And I have people that run those.15200:26:37.380 --> 00:26:47.539Rick Sessinghaus: But I'm still gonna need need to be in meetings. I'm still gonna need to. It's like shit. I don't have any time to begin with, and now I'm kicking myself in the ass for saying yes in the 1st place, so so I've had some.15300:26:47.540 --> 00:26:59.474The Alliance: You could. This is how this is how I I think about those things. So you've got the right front end filter right if it's not in line with the mission and the higher goals. It's an immediate no.15400:27:01.820 --> 00:27:13.610The Alliance: the next filter. And this is, I think, the one that you might want to think about. But tell me if you're applying it already when I get a brand opportunity, something that will help either Stephen Cod or one of the companies. Right?15500:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.070The Alliance: I15600:27:15.750 --> 00:27:30.359The Alliance: I look at it. I go. Okay, that's that's really cool. But is it a better opportunity than finishing this book or finishing my AI, right? I measure it again like, which is 6 months from now, if they're both real.15700:27:31.110 --> 00:27:41.639The Alliance: which one's the bigger lift, if it's not a bigger lift than the things I'm currently working on. Right. I'll give you an example of my own life. I guard my time like15800:27:42.250 --> 00:27:51.760The Alliance: crazy, but I just agreed to be a regular guest on Peter DA man. This is once a month tech update podcast with him and Salim ismail.15900:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.410The Alliance: because it's seen by a million people, and16000:27:55.430 --> 00:28:17.580The Alliance: like every episode, gets watched by like a million people. And there's no like there. So I can say no to almost every other. Podcast I need to do right? Like, it's a like that's massive. I'm gonna reach a million people once a month through this, podcast and I'm gonna get extra content for my audience to like that. I gotta say yes to and yes. Is it gonna be 2 h and some prep time? Yes, but like16100:28:17.580 --> 00:28:30.510The Alliance: it would. It would be so hard, I mean reaching a million people is fucking hard, you know. So you jump it like that. So I think about it that way. If it's not really a huge springboard, and if the time management16200:28:30.510 --> 00:28:39.450The Alliance: it's gonna take away from the other primaries, I tend to say, No, I also have found that16300:28:41.450 --> 00:28:48.220The Alliance: so right now and then, this may not be where you are, but there's a certain amount like you're at a certain level16400:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.130The Alliance: where the offer is good for you.16500:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.819The Alliance: and you get to a different level where the offer is good for them, and when you get to the point where the offer is good for them.16600:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.710The Alliance: You can say, Okay, I wanna I wanna be involved because this is great. But16700:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.780The Alliance: you can have an hour, a month.16800:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.629The Alliance: How can I help that way?16900:29:06.830 --> 00:29:11.880The Alliance: Right? So if you get the AI coach and the book17000:29:11.930 --> 00:29:40.340The Alliance: and improve the status right, you get to dictate terms on this, the super the other projects a little bit more. So it's not like they go away. You just get more power in the equation to negotiate in ways that like. And you always got to negotiate, for, like all this stuff is cool. Right? That's the reason we want to be like, well known thought leading famous people, because, like the shit that comes your way is just fucking cool.17100:29:40.340 --> 00:29:49.310The Alliance: and you it you. It's neat. And you want to say yes, to a lot of it. But like I always to me, it's like what is going to get me the farthest17200:29:49.480 --> 00:30:06.679The Alliance: and with like, how can I provide the most value for the least amount of time. Those are the activities I'm saying yes to that are not my primaries, and you know, and I think of it that way. I don't know if that's helpful at all. The other thing that I that you may want to do.17300:30:06.840 --> 00:30:13.020The Alliance: I don't know if you've done this or not. I find this very important. I talked about this a little bit in class, but literally make a list of the 1017400:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.049The Alliance: feelings you like best on the planet.17500:30:16.240 --> 00:30:23.160The Alliance: Just the 10 right, and I'd be as honest with yourself as you possibly can be in that list is helpful.17600:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.069The Alliance: But if it, my feeling is17700:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.670The Alliance: 1st of all, when it comes to time management, if it's not on my top 10 list, and it's not pointed at my primary goals.17800:30:32.950 --> 00:30:46.220The Alliance: or it's not gonna provide use. Leverage is an automatic. No, it's an automatic. No like. There's definitely like, why am I gonna waste time on my 27th favorite activity when I could do top 3. So17900:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.440The Alliance: you know.18000:30:47.890 --> 00:31:16.960The Alliance: I make decisions differently that way. And like, you know, I don't do a lot of things like go out to dinner like a lot of those things, because I'm like this is not. It's actually not on the category. And you know, unless I'm going for world class, Chinese food, there's nothing on my list that like I got one thing, and if you got this I'm in, and if you don't got this, the answer is no like, literally. When it comes to going out to dinner. My question is like you got to be a good friend or dying, or it's gonna be world class, Chinese food.18100:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.130Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, yeah.18200:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.600The Alliance: Otherwise there's no.18300:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.599The Alliance: I know it sounds funny, but the having those metrics in place is useful to me.18400:31:26.600 --> 00:31:41.259Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, what's helped me in the last couple of years is, I have and I'll call him a gatekeeper right now to take some of those opportunities, and he filters them through 1st in some cases, and he kind of protects me and protects our brand to say.18500:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.369The Alliance: Oh, yeah, dude. You gotta have a chief of staff.18600:31:44.370 --> 00:31:44.800Rick Sessinghaus: And.18700:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.390The Alliance: Yeah, that's great.18800:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.504Rick Sessinghaus: So that's improved. I think the other thing, which is more of a18900:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.829Rick Sessinghaus: something I continue to deal with is a scarcity mindset of19000:31:55.950 --> 00:32:11.070Rick Sessinghaus: if I say no to this. Oh, no, right it's and what I've of course found in the last few years is no, doesn't mean it's never going to happen, or they're going to come back to me in 6 months and say we still want you, and and unfortunately, that I'm rewiring that a little bit of.19100:32:11.070 --> 00:32:17.470The Alliance: Dude. That's not a scarcity mindset. So it is a little bit. It's actually a hustler's mindset19200:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.699The Alliance: when you're coming up. If you're a hustler, if you're actually gonna make it in this world.19300:32:22.850 --> 00:32:29.759The Alliance: you fucking. Say yes to everything. And you you do, I mean, like you. Just you just say yes, right, and19400:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.829The Alliance: I mean I. So I think I,19500:32:33.200 --> 00:32:41.649The Alliance: at least into my mid to late thirties, was that guy and had to be, and it was19600:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.860The Alliance: only around the time I started my 1st flow company that was like19700:32:46.140 --> 00:33:08.369The Alliance: that is like, it's gotta be no. This is right. And I focus, trimmed it down to like 4 projects. And so I that's how I think you don't. That's a hard one, because it's hardwired into your like annex system, right, and it doesn't go away until you prove to yourself that saying no actually got you farther than saying Yes.19800:33:10.010 --> 00:33:16.279Rick Sessinghaus: That's the achievement side, totally. The other thing that I'm fighting against is, and my team sees it is.19900:33:16.650 --> 00:33:30.469Rick Sessinghaus: They see that I'm more stressed than before, and I work very long hours. I don't mind working long hours, by the way, but I'm saying now I'm starting to make mistakes, and I never made those mistakes before, because I'm not20000:33:30.470 --> 00:33:54.510Rick Sessinghaus: honoring my schedule and my and putting boundaries, because I'm saying yes, and I I mean and I know, and I appreciate you. Listening to this is like I feel responsible for so many people. Now when it was just a 1. Here's Rick's coaching business, and now I'm responsible for a bill. A company that keeps building. My daughter is going to work under me to do the Performing Arts division because she's a singer from Nyu, and it's like now I mean, it's like20100:33:54.920 --> 00:34:00.690Rick Sessinghaus: that has shifted a little bit of why, I continue to say yes to some things. I hope that.20200:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.801The Alliance: Well, I mean one like if I gotta tell you flat out like flat out, I'm listening to you.20300:34:09.610 --> 00:34:17.089The Alliance: If you're building a AI, Rick, if you're writing a book, if you're coaching clients and your company is expanding.20400:34:17.270 --> 00:34:23.339The Alliance: there's no other. Yes, in your life, and you better get somebody to come in, and20500:34:24.100 --> 00:34:45.210The Alliance: with at least one of those like like you're gonna get cream like I'm not. This is not me coaching you. This is like me from the outside as a friend being like dude. You're you're gonna give me cream, because, by the way, you just said the smartest thing, though, you said the thing because I've been in that spot. I know I know this spot when you start making mistakes.20600:34:45.909 --> 00:35:02.180The Alliance: Those aren't going to go away as these projects get more right like these are growth. All of these are growth projects. A book gets bigger before it gets smaller. You got to finish it, and then you got to publicize it, and it gets loud. And you're on podcasts20700:35:02.290 --> 00:35:13.590The Alliance: 5 times a week talking about your book on top of your regular schedule. It's gonna get bigger. Your company is as this thing gets more successful, like dude. How many meetings a week are you having?20800:35:13.710 --> 00:35:24.620The Alliance: It sounds like it sounds like to run that division. You're gonna have to have a meeting a week at least, with the head of each division, and then a meeting with everybody together. So if you've got20900:35:25.150 --> 00:35:31.650The Alliance: 3 divisions and everything together, that's that's 4 to 6 HA week that you're not doing now.21000:35:31.990 --> 00:35:33.350The Alliance: and that's common.21100:35:33.940 --> 00:35:42.599The Alliance: and AI wreck. You know what I'm saying. So like everything else, should be a no, and everything you should be doing now is winnowing away those things21200:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.870The Alliance: a win is going to be like. I got something off my plate this week, and it's like I put it to bed.21300:35:51.460 --> 00:35:57.359Rick Sessinghaus: No, so that that's helpful. And I I do understand my patterns, and I think, as as my.21400:35:57.390 --> 00:36:12.870Rick Sessinghaus: I was always a very good coach and known in my area. And then, 6 years ago, when the player that I've worked with for so long bursts on the scenes wins 2 major championships. That was that next level where people wanted more from me, and that was fantastic.21500:36:12.870 --> 00:36:28.989Rick Sessinghaus: Yet I'm still in the mindset of 10 years ago that oh, I have to build my brand. It's like I got people all the time, hey? I just saw you on golf channel. I just saw it's like, Oh, wow! Let's go. So it's like, why am I in that mindset still, when things are now, where can I take this now and then saying, No,21600:36:29.530 --> 00:36:36.094The Alliance: No, it's I mean, this is Marshall Goldsmith. What got you there won't get you there right like this is, you know, and21700:36:38.610 --> 00:36:56.180The Alliance: you know it's what I said in class. We're so much more defined by what we say no to than what we say yes to, and we don't realize it. No! Is such an important, important, important skill. The other thing that I have sort of mastered is like the delayed. Maybe.21800:36:57.717 --> 00:37:05.460The Alliance: Right? Like the really delayed baby, like I'm writing books for the next 3 years. But like, that's kind of an interesting idea. So let's revisit.21900:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.209Rick Sessinghaus: I've used that a lot now, because I know this is my busy time. The next 3 months I'm on the road22000:37:12.990 --> 00:37:25.050Rick Sessinghaus: almost every other week for Pj. Tour events. The British open all this stuff, I said. I'll get back to you after August 15, th right at the time. There's a free freedom with that, and I need to22100:37:25.220 --> 00:37:34.489Rick Sessinghaus: utilize that more often. And I'm not lying to people, but part of it could be. I can have a built in excuse that gives me some space22200:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.907Rick Sessinghaus: to to not commit to anything.22300:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.970The Alliance: Well, the other. The other thing is this that you don't22400:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.765The Alliance: think about because you're still looking at it from a hustler's mindset. But22500:37:46.270 --> 00:37:53.359The Alliance: If you can't call them back till August. You're a scarce resource, and you have more value.22600:37:53.360 --> 00:37:53.740Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.22700:37:53.740 --> 00:38:18.999The Alliance: Right like that. Just is what it is, especially if the person you're not calling back till August. Is that important like? I do that to people all the time. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm really just managing my time. But, like, you know, it's routine for me to be like, Hey, man, I'm like, I'm going crazy. I'm finishing 3 books and launch a company. I'm gonna talk to you in 2 months, you know. I'm cool with this conversation, but like, that's what we're doing. Otherwise we're not. Gonna I can't talk to you.22800:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.889The Alliance: It's a it's a boundary drawing skill.22900:38:27.490 --> 00:38:35.409The Alliance: Are you good at? Are you doing more of it? Should we give you an exercise like you? Have to draw 3 boundaries a week that you aren't normally drawing, or something like that like, would that help.23000:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.080Rick Sessinghaus: No, it's it's a skill I need to develop for sure.23100:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.280Rick Sessinghaus: for sure. And it's gotten better because I have my23200:38:42.750 --> 00:39:01.690Rick Sessinghaus: kind of business operator director who's now our day to day? Who is gonna look at my emails. He's gonna anybody requests for students. They come to me. It's like, No, they're coming to him 1st to interview them. Is they a good fit? So there are some protocols put into play. But we are as a company23300:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.300Rick Sessinghaus: with what we're doing, especially in the golf space.23400:39:04.980 --> 00:39:13.690Rick Sessinghaus: is we're a leader in it, and and that requires now having some meetings with like you mentioned a Diamandis who might have 1 million followers. I may have somebody who has23500:39:13.840 --> 00:39:32.370Rick Sessinghaus: a Instagram thing for a hundred 1,000 followers right? And now, hey, we want to put you on there. So we're going okay. Well, that's better marketing than us doing a bunch of cold emails, right? So those opportunities come more and more. And I think that's me just communicating with my team. A little clearer is like, what is the end result on this? And is this time, and23600:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.140Rick Sessinghaus: we're getting there. But.23700:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.210The Alliance: The other. The other thing is23800:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.989The Alliance: some of it is brand building, but it sounds like the brand sort of built.23900:39:45.180 --> 00:39:52.090The Alliance: So it's not that you want to say no to the Instagrams. It's that you want to batch them.24000:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.480Rick Sessinghaus: Hmm.24100:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.070The Alliance: Oh, this is really cool.24200:39:55.090 --> 00:40:15.935The Alliance: Rick isn't doing. Gonna be doing press for the next 2 months. But we're we've got these 3 days where we're gonna really, you know, spend. And then you just like, literally do podcast podcast pod, you know what I mean, like, I don't think I don't think you say? No, I think you just push it off to a point in your schedule where, like this is my media days, because the other thing is24300:40:16.210 --> 00:40:36.239The Alliance: that kind of stuff. It burns a lot of energy. It takes a lot of juice out of you and gets you super hyped up afterwards. Which is it like? It's a double edge. You know what I mean like it. Both are problematic for good work, so it's better to sort of batch process them. I try not to do more than 3 podcasts a day, because I forget what I've said on intro with them.24400:40:39.010 --> 00:40:49.839The Alliance: That's my limit, like, by the time you get me onto my 4th one. I have no idea who asked me what question, and I'm like. Am I repeating myself? I'm sure I'm repeating, my, you know what I mean like.24500:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.410Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.24600:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.620The Alliance: Oh, God!24700:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.770Rick Sessinghaus: That's funny. No, that's very helpful. Thank you.24800:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.270The Alliance: Yeah, I like.24900:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.939The Alliance: By the way, there's a reason25000:41:01.990 --> 00:41:18.680The Alliance: in the general, like professional creatives, artists, right? Like all all those people, they batch communications as a general. They do this right like you'll go on a press tour, Hollywood goes on a press tour. Nobody like you don't come to the movie set25100:41:18.680 --> 00:41:40.320The Alliance: and get interview like maybe one journalist gets access. But as a general, no, no, these are the 5 days we're gonna do this because it requires its own kind of Kung Fu to be really good at, and it's helpful to get a bunch of laps through like you get polished. You get your pat like all that stuff I find really useful. And it like. And you're not giving anything up25200:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.090The Alliance: right?25300:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.270Rick Sessinghaus: No, that's helpful.25400:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.100Rick Sessinghaus: Awesome.25500:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.670Rick Sessinghaus: Do you mind if I rapid fire you a few things.25600:41:51.914 --> 00:41:54.600The Alliance: Hit me! No, no! Hit me we've got. We've got time.25700:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.545Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah,25800:41:57.140 --> 00:42:10.680Rick Sessinghaus: so this is a a very general question. Since I've been. And I'm just gonna call it the performance development space for 30 years. And I've seen things change obviously with technology and websites and online platform and such.25900:42:11.010 --> 00:42:16.230Rick Sessinghaus: what's your opinion of the future of performance development? And so I've been a26000:42:16.470 --> 00:42:38.680Rick Sessinghaus: involved with flow research collective from the get go. I briefly met you in Seattle for the the 1st coaching cohort when 2020. So I love learning, I love. And and so I'm that typical guy who just loves to learn as we're moving into AI and moving into like I had a conversation with Whit this morning from the Flow Alliance. And we're talking about some stuff.26100:42:39.480 --> 00:42:54.830Rick Sessinghaus: And this is from a business perspective. Me, who is in that industry wanting to monetize performance development. Where are you seeing the trends? And I know AI is a part of it. But I'm looking at from the business opportunities.26200:42:56.060 --> 00:43:02.120The Alliance: So in no particular order in fast26300:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.189The Alliance: live events are gonna matter more than anything.26400:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.140Rick Sessinghaus: Yep. Yep.26500:43:09.440 --> 00:43:24.639The Alliance: I do not believe certain categories of coaching. For example, golf coaching. There's a lot you could do, AI and simulator and all that stuff. But golf is a game that is played outdoors, and26600:43:25.710 --> 00:43:34.379The Alliance: I think people are gonna still want golf coaches. You know what I mean. And I and I. And I think so. I think at the upper level of this stuff26700:43:35.550 --> 00:43:40.070The Alliance: flesh and blood humans who really know what they're doing have jobs, I think.26800:43:41.730 --> 00:43:47.330The Alliance: coming up in the business is gonna be very difficult. They're gonna you're gonna have to come to work for guys like us26900:43:47.390 --> 00:44:13.110The Alliance: because everybody else is going to be using AI. So there's gonna be no. Some of the stupid jobs are, gonna be, you know, unless you have tons of money, it's gonna be 8 8 out, I think. I think your diversification into the AI systems is the smartest thing you sort of could be doing. I think the flesh and blood coaching is really interested. Interesting. I will tell you that27000:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.110The Alliance: I am not a hundred percent certain.27100:44:17.250 --> 00:44:37.660The Alliance: It's a smart idea for you to go anywhere near pro for the performing arts, coaching space, because it's a big vertical leap from you. I know your daughter's there, and I know she wants to be there. But like I look at that, and I'm like dude. You don't even know like that's not your world that's so far from your world. That strikes me as like27200:44:37.950 --> 00:44:51.700The Alliance: a little afield and a little bit of a distraction for family, and maybe that's it's a worthwhile distraction, and maybe it's a growth market. But that's not a category of people who have a lot of money unless you're at the very, very top.27300:44:51.850 --> 00:45:05.829The Alliance: And are you going to give that category enough focus to be at the very like to be. Tom Hanks's like Tom Hanks is napkin coach right? Do you know who he is? Have you talked. You know what I mean like. That's my point. Like.27400:45:06.350 --> 00:45:20.059Rick Sessinghaus: So along those lines. So I have somebody who is mentoring my daughter, who is actually going to be the face of our performing arts. His name is Dr. Don Green. Work for Juilliard, work for Sydney Opera House, or and so he has the contact.27500:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.430The Alliance: Okay.27600:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.950The Alliance: Okay?27700:45:20.950 --> 00:45:27.619The Alliance: So that's that's that's that's better. And then it's then it's less of a management problem. I27800:45:28.450 --> 00:45:32.660The Alliance: and and Rick, let me flat out. Part of me is fucking, terrified.27900:45:33.320 --> 00:45:41.449The Alliance: terrified, like I don't. I don't like it. I like I I sort of like playing with AI. I find it useful. But28000:45:41.630 --> 00:45:43.179The Alliance: I like, I28100:45:43.560 --> 00:45:49.910The Alliance: really think, in the next 2, 3 to 5 years, we're looking at like 30% white collar unemployment.28200:45:50.451 --> 00:46:19.769The Alliance: The only new job I've seen pop up since this is started, because prompt engineer isn't a real job. It's a fake job until people actually figure out how to use AI like prompt engineers for people who have have figured out that you can talk to AI like you talk to a normal person right? Like once you figure that out. That's not a job. The only job that exists I've seen is AI coach people training other people how to work with AI that only exists until the AI gets good enough to train other people right? And that's certainly like28300:46:20.579 --> 00:46:28.489The Alliance: soon. So there are 2 questions here, how do I think it's gonna impact guys like us?28400:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.829The Alliance: I'm less worried about us having jobs. I'm worried about our clients having jobs.28500:46:34.330 --> 00:46:37.020Rick Sessinghaus: Hmm, yeah. Got it.28600:46:37.020 --> 00:46:37.820The Alliance: Right.28700:46:37.980 --> 00:46:45.789The Alliance: That's like I see a market for the guys at the top. I don't like I don't know like it worries me about like28800:46:45.940 --> 00:46:56.004The Alliance: who I'm going to be able to sell products to, because I worry about their level of disposable income. More than I worry about like that sort of stuff with me.28900:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.460The Alliance: and that, by the way, I don't know how long, like29000:47:06.830 --> 00:47:34.228The Alliance: I don't know how long that advantage last. You know what I mean again. I don't know how long it's gonna last. I'm looking at 2, 3 year time horizons. I think we still have jobs. But I'm not. I'm not 100% certain. And now, mind you, if universal basic income comes up sooner rather than later, then we definitely have you know what I mean. Then it's so like there's a lot of reactionary stuff. And the way I think about it is sort of29100:47:38.580 --> 00:48:04.509The Alliance: the way I like you seem like you've got a diversified portfolio. You've got an AI arm right. There's an AI thing. So you're in that spot. You're not going to get lapped by it. You're staying in front of it. You have a human element, and you can still always, I would guess, show up at a golf course and do a like big event and have a hundred people. You know what I mean, like, you could right like, there's a lot of. So I like diversification29200:48:04.720 --> 00:48:17.367The Alliance: is I like, and and being able to being nimble and agile with your company, and having, you know, we can go this direction this direction this direction pretty quickly. I think it's gonna matter and29300:48:18.510 --> 00:48:28.640The Alliance: I think it's I think it's scary. And I like I the I think it's really scary now, and the other thing I want to say is, I also believe we're in the middle of a hype cycle.29400:48:29.060 --> 00:48:29.850The Alliance: so I don't.29500:48:30.194 --> 00:48:30.540Rick Sessinghaus: Sorry.29600:48:30.540 --> 00:49:00.002The Alliance: Hype cycle. The Gardner Hype curve says that a technology gets introduced, lots of hype big noise, and then it sort of renormalizes. And the AI hype doesn't sound any different to me than the metaverse hype or the blockchain hype or the Bitcoin nft. You know what I mean, and none of those things, with the possible exception of Bitcoin, are really like the metaverse doesn't exist at all other than in Mark Zuckerberg's imagination.29700:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.460The Alliance: and29800:49:01.990 --> 00:49:13.770The Alliance: nfts are not a market. If they're like people lost 1 billion rights, like of those things, blockchain is sort of starting to show up and do some stuff. But it's very slow roll. Like all the things29900:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.340The Alliance: the adoption rates are much slower and30000:49:17.550 --> 00:49:21.770The Alliance: they're not, you know. And and the reality. I say this to people all the time.30100:49:22.370 --> 00:49:32.509The Alliance: Yeah, Gpt is very good at coding. It's interesting to think with his partner for science. But it's not it's not replacing the scientists. It's a good thinking partner. It's a terrible writer.30200:49:32.580 --> 00:49:53.430The Alliance: It's terrible still terrible, I mean, like honest to God, like we have laughable experiences with chat, gpt and writing so like the rhetoric doesn't match our day to day experience. I don't care what people are saying. Yes, there are certain categories where like I would not want to be a coder right now.30300:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.939The Alliance: I don't necessarily know if I'd want to be a cameraman.30400:49:58.490 --> 00:50:10.569The Alliance: you know, though, cameramen who know how to use. AI. Those people are killing it. And coders who know how to use AI are gonna end up being the ones who keep their jobs. So like.30500:50:15.220 --> 00:50:24.594The Alliance: I I wanna see what the new jobs are. And I don't think we've seen what the new jobs are yet, either. So I like, I don't know if that's helpful I like I30600:50:24.870 --> 00:50:52.999Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah, I think where I'm looking at is that I've always tried to diversify myself, even when I was just a 1 man show. And then with our with our company, we certify coaches. So we have 180 golf coaches worldwide that have gone through a certification for mental game. We do live events. We have an online app, we license our content to golf academies across the world. So we have licensing fees. So and I have one on 1, 1 on one I'm not too concerned with at all, any anyways, for where I'm at in my brand30700:50:53.271 --> 00:51:04.118Rick Sessinghaus: the live events we know we're gonna double down on, because as as AI gets more, we want the that human experience they want to see me present. I'm a i'm a very good presenter. I'm very good, you know.30800:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.380Rick Sessinghaus: I guess I was just looking at the overall is.30900:51:07.880 --> 00:51:29.199Rick Sessinghaus: I think, people are more curious than ever before I know a lot of my younger students college. They're listening to podcasts. They want to learn. Okay, how do we monetize their curiosity of learning, I think is going to be challenging because there is a lot of free good stuff out there. And AI now becomes another tool of that. So I think that was kind of like where the trends of31000:51:29.340 --> 00:51:36.450Rick Sessinghaus: building a personal development business is a lot different than back in the Tony Robbins days.31100:51:36.830 --> 00:51:41.370The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I've said this. I've said this for a while. That31200:51:45.240 --> 00:51:53.900The Alliance: I don't know how people get into these businesses right now I'm not like it's so much like it's much I see, like31300:51:57.560 --> 00:52:06.675The Alliance: golfers are gonna end up with the coaches that they work with coming. You know what I mean, like there's pathways in. But there's not. I agree with you. I think it's31400:52:11.810 --> 00:52:15.010The Alliance: like, I know, flow for writers, for example.31500:52:17.120 --> 00:52:25.580The Alliance: it's gonna continue to exist as a class, because it does some stuff that the AI can't do, and it teaches you how to write with AI and stuff like that. But like31600:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.609The Alliance: what we used to do is 0 to dangerous.31700:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.140The Alliance: Honestly.31800:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.730The Alliance: you could use it. You know what I mean. You could probably take all my books and all my research, and you could you know what I mean? You could do all that stuff.31900:52:40.520 --> 00:52:48.150The Alliance: I'm more fun than you know the AI. So like, you know, humor and fun and those sorts of like their advantages. But like.32000:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.950The Alliance: yeah, man, I like, is it a job in 10 years?32100:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.560The Alliance: I don't know.32200:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.300The Alliance: Yeah, I32300:52:54.300 --> 00:53:07.120The Alliance: I don't know. But then, again, here's the other thing that I think like 10 years ago, I almost had a different job. I mean. I still wrote books, but, like everything else I did with my day was pretty damn different.32400:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.330The Alliance: So32500:53:08.490 --> 00:53:21.609The Alliance: I've been really nimble and agile, and my whole career. And I that's it that those are traits in me. I don't think those are going away. So just because the tools are changing and the world is speeding up.32600:53:21.740 --> 00:53:30.243The Alliance: provided it doesn't lead to like complete societal meltdown, which it absolutely could.32700:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.030The Alliance: Oh.32800:53:39.370 --> 00:53:48.539The Alliance: I like like I like. I like our chances for a while like, I think it's gonna be slightly slower. I think you're gonna get AI free countries, zones, communities.32900:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.270The Alliance: country clubs. You know what I mean33000:53:51.770 --> 00:53:56.009The Alliance: atomies. I think you're gonna hold like people are like, aren't you worried about your33100:53:56.360 --> 00:54:16.120The Alliance: book writing career? And I'm like, Are you fucking kidding? I'm printing up made by humans, for humans stamps the stamp on every one of my books like are like, I was like, Are you kidding? I was like, if I was a shit writer trying to come up. I don't know how you do that. I don't know how you cut your teeth33200:54:16.120 --> 00:54:44.660The Alliance: writing magazines articles anymore, because the a like a lot of the like. That stuff is gonna go away. But the like. I think magazines are gonna come back because they're gatekeepers, and they're filtered information, and when you can know everything at all the times like, it's sort of nice to have these little like. It's like somebody else made you a playlist of ideas, because now ideas are everywhere. So what you actually want is curated ideas. So if you're an idea, Curator.33300:54:45.660 --> 00:54:53.810The Alliance: you have a little of an advantage to last long. No, because, Ted, give me ideas that Stephen Collar would curate for me.33400:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.880Rick Sessinghaus: Got it.33500:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.670The Alliance: It's true you could do it, but like.33600:54:59.870 --> 00:55:00.550Rick Sessinghaus: Yeah.33700:55:00.810 --> 00:55:17.310Rick Sessinghaus: So the next 2 questions are related. So I've been following your work for a long, long time when you did flow Geno project, and I know you and Jamie kind of mentioned something called like a flow dojo back in the day, right? And so I'm looking at potentially33800:55:17.856 --> 00:55:25.983Rick Sessinghaus: my company having an indoor facility to experience things to help somebody train the mental game and and and such33900:55:26.610 --> 00:55:34.440Rick Sessinghaus: So one indoor facilities. In golf. Of course we talk simulator, and the next part of that is34000:55:34.720 --> 00:55:46.929Rick Sessinghaus: you were. It was the latest interview you with Diamandis. And I couldn't catch it again. But I think you said something to the face. It was either an interface or device34100:55:46.930 --> 00:56:06.140Rick Sessinghaus: that may have been tracking flow, or something like that, like, I use a very basic Eeg device called focus calm, that measures brainwave activity. A golfer can hit golf balls with it on it empowers them because they can see. Oh, that breath work, change that visualization. They can see that change. And it makes them feel different. Right? I want to use technology to be able to34200:56:07.070 --> 00:56:20.359Rick Sessinghaus: train, measure, flow, anchor it, and I wanted your feedback. So it's a 2 step process indoor facilities. And then what tech do you know of that would help in training flow.34300:56:21.850 --> 00:56:28.970The Alliance: But what I was talking about is Dr. Michael Menino's company synergy, which measures group, flow.34400:56:29.270 --> 00:56:32.389Rick Sessinghaus: Right, and that was with like zoom. And then seeing.34500:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.590The Alliance: Yeah, exactly.34600:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.729Rick Sessinghaus: I thought you said something to the effect.34700:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.100Rick Sessinghaus: That was a device, because I remember I do remember that side of it. That's.34800:56:42.100 --> 00:56:49.490The Alliance: I haven't seen anything. I mean, we've been trying to build a biophysic waste flow detector. There's a34900:56:50.050 --> 00:56:50.790The Alliance: I mean35000:56:51.130 --> 00:57:00.470The Alliance: anything that's gonna tell you if your brainwaves are at the Alpha Theta borderline is gonna get you, you know, at least that way, close and35100:57:04.970 --> 00:57:10.780The Alliance: But no, there's I mean. That's what we've been sort of working on secretly for a long time. It doesn't really exist yet.35200:57:10.780 --> 00:57:17.910Rick Sessinghaus: Right? Okay? As I. Yeah, I just wanted to know some of the bait like, I can't use muse or anything like that, because once you start moving, literally moving your.35300:57:17.910 --> 00:57:28.350The Alliance: Yeah, there's yeah, there's not any. That's why, eg. Is probably not gonna be the the flow technology unless they can really cancel all that out.35400:57:28.720 --> 00:57:36.269Rick Sessinghaus: Company that we're partnered with. They say they have an algorithm AI wise that minimizes artifacts and stuff like that. We like it simple.35500:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.930The Alliance: Here's the big. Here's the biggest problem on that one.35600:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.800The Alliance: Ask if you could see their algorithm, and they're going to tell you it's proprietary.35700:57:43.910 --> 00:57:49.859The Alliance: and we always say no when they say that, because if we can't, if it's proprietary we can't publish.35800:57:49.990 --> 00:58:03.880The Alliance: can't write a paper about what I discovered. So it doesn't like proprietary. It may work in the world, but it's no good to me as a researcher, because it's no longer open, sourced, and I don't own the code on what I'm doing, so.35900:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.769Rick Sessinghaus: Got it. Got it.36000:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.280The Alliance: Stay away from it.36100:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.569Rick Sessinghaus: And I'm not asking kind of business advice, but just like this indoor facility.36200:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.259The Alliance: By the way, I mean, it seems like.36300:58:13.260 --> 00:58:16.930Rick Sessinghaus: Dream of mine to have a place that can immerse somebody in36400:58:18.720 --> 00:58:42.200Rick Sessinghaus: again. We have this focus, calm thing, breath work. I can put them in a simulated situation which might create stress, hitting it over the water. I'm trying to because I do believe that that human touch idea is not going to go anyway. Time soon. I think that's part of it. And I'm going to put somebody in that environment I'm not talking about. I think, where you guys were going with. Really, you know, wacky stuff and and.36500:58:42.200 --> 00:58:49.069The Alliance: Well, I the flow Dojo was. I mean it was Jamie's brainchild, but I like I never quite36600:58:50.100 --> 00:58:55.209The Alliance: got it, because, like once you got past the adrenaline response.36700:58:55.490 --> 00:59:14.990The Alliance: A lot of that stuff wasn't as it didn't feel flow. It wasn't. You know what I mean. It was more like a show than a thing. And I was like, you know, we had ideas for how to build it out into like a real, interesting sort of circus of things, but like it was never36800:59:15.610 --> 00:59:24.770The Alliance: safe. I never got to an idea where I was like. This is scalable and safe, really like I never. So I and I thought it was the wrong approach. And I've also said that36900:59:26.030 --> 00:59:30.610The Alliance: if you're gonna do, that fucking wave pool is better than anything37000:59:31.010 --> 00:59:54.093The Alliance: like oh, like, just build a weight pool, I mean, like, come on, you know what I mean like this is, we shouldn't even have it, because we know they're like that to me sort of solves that problem as far as an indoor golf facility where you're doing all like the full surround sound like stations for for mental training.37100:59:58.190 --> 01:00:04.020The Alliance: so my brain, I go to 3 things.37201:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.690The Alliance: One, I think37301:00:09.890 --> 01:00:18.369The Alliance: every golf thing in the world that I've been to as the same golf vibe37401:00:19.630 --> 01:00:23.102The Alliance: country clubs. They they have a they have a feel37501:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.267Rick Sessinghaus: Nice to you,37601:00:26.180 --> 01:00:43.202The Alliance: I would guess that's not every golfer. I would guess there's a huge market that can't stand that. So an indoor facility that has a different vibe that is literally like engineered very differently to not be that37701:00:45.550 --> 01:00:51.945The Alliance: I think you're giving up some low, hanging, easy fruit, but I think it's a bit like that market. That one37801:00:52.630 --> 01:00:57.659The Alliance: is interesting to me. The second thing that I think is is the is the like.37901:01:02.470 --> 01:01:23.729The Alliance: This is the problem with the flow Dodo that Jamie built is the story coming out of his mouth versus the experience in the Dojo were very different. You can't. That doesn't work you right? So you actually need an experience in the Dojo that, like one, you have to prove the following things, you got to prove to me that38001:01:23.850 --> 01:01:38.090The Alliance: if I spend 40 min in your indoor golf simulator swinging, and then I move to the super cool virtual reality. Putt putt course, and then I move to the focus machine. That next week, when I go out into the course.38101:01:38.220 --> 01:01:48.530The Alliance: you just knocked a shot off my score or something along those lines so like, where I'm excited by this is not.38201:01:49.330 --> 01:01:53.010The Alliance: And this is not. This is not gonna make you happy. I don't think but it38301:01:53.130 --> 01:01:56.479The Alliance: so I like. I'm less excited about where you end up.38401:01:56.600 --> 01:02:18.879The Alliance: Then how you test shit along the way to get there, so that the actual experience you're claiming to sell because it. The one thing that I definitely learned is with these experiential things. If there's a mismatch between what you're telling people is gonna happen and what's gonna happen? It really doesn't work right? And38501:02:19.550 --> 01:02:23.490The Alliance: I would also, in a really weird way.38601:02:23.890 --> 01:02:29.400The Alliance: So I'm on the board of a company that I probably shouldn't be on the board of called Jump VR,38701:02:29.880 --> 01:02:40.543The Alliance: that does base jumping simulations and the out of physical locations. And they they have one in Utah. That's their prime location, and I shouldn't be on the board because I was on their board.38801:02:41.150 --> 01:03:06.139The Alliance: they wanted to do research on the platform, and what they really wanted was marketing. And I don't do marketing research for people right? If you you do your own marketing research. I want to do actual. So it didn't end up working out. We tried a bunch of stuff, but I will say they have sort of. They built the same guys who built the void in when it was in Santa Monica. They have sort of mastered the art of like what an actual immersive experience38901:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.042The Alliance: should be for the customer, and their shit definitely puts people into flow.39001:03:11.420 --> 01:03:18.959The Alliance: there, I will say their rhetoric doesn't quite match their experience. So like it was neat. Once. Am I going back?39101:03:18.960 --> 01:03:30.190The Alliance: No, cause. The wingsuit was really uncomfortable, fly, and the experience was like cool, but not like. I didn't feel like, oh, if I master this thing? Am I gonna like the flow experience? And39201:03:30.370 --> 01:03:47.199The Alliance: no, I'm really not. These things are fucking, uncomfortable flying. I'm not flying in an actual environment. So I it's not worth it to me to master this particular thing and get flow elsewhere. And it's not improving anything in the real world right like they're not. It's not making a better wingsuit pilot. So.39301:03:47.200 --> 01:03:47.590Rick Sessinghaus: And pretend.39401:03:47.590 --> 01:03:51.639The Alliance: Doesn't like. So on both cases like. And39501:03:52.160 --> 01:04:07.100The Alliance: it's a it's a not, it's a. They have a theme park. They don't have any. They don't have a thing that you want to go back to. The train flow so like those are the things I think about business wise and I like it, and I like the thing is39601:04:08.570 --> 01:04:11.980The Alliance: you want to do it. In a in a community where there's already39701:04:12.340 --> 01:04:20.160The Alliance: people already come together to hang out like if that's already built into golf. So giving golfers a place to come together and hang out with other golfers.39801:04:21.270 --> 01:04:26.080The Alliance: you know. And certainly.39901:04:28.210 --> 01:04:36.799The Alliance: if you put the other thing is like I would tell you that, like I would only open my 1st 10 locations in places it snowed a lot.40001:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.460The Alliance: I wouldn't put this fucking thing in Florida40101:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.860The Alliance: or Arizona or California to start cause.40201:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.809The Alliance: Now you have to compete with real golf.40301:04:51.330 --> 01:05:08.899The Alliance: and you will not win over time climbing gyms. Work sort of because you can. You can. You can train them up a bit, and you can do a little bit of compression of time. So you may have, like the after workout crowd who might come in to train with you, but like, I think.40401:05:09.130 --> 01:05:15.700The Alliance: low hanging fruit. Bra, go someplace for half the year. People, you're the only show in town, or they have to travel.40501:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.640Rick Sessinghaus: I think, and I have to respect your time here, that I think that40601:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.529Rick Sessinghaus: I am the only show in town when it comes to mental performance in golf.40701:05:23.860 --> 01:05:48.140Rick Sessinghaus: So I'm not trying to compete against. Bring. Come in here and work on your golf swing. I'm here to provide the the tools and strategies, as we say, go from a fear state to a flow state in an environment where they can learn how their breath work and stuff like that. And it's it's then having that spot like you say, community stuff. So we've done plenty of live events throughout the world. It's now saying, Okay, if I had a hub that I'm from.40801:05:48.140 --> 01:05:56.450The Alliance: What I'm trying. What all I'm saying is that as a very marketing perspective, your hub is gonna compete against real golf40901:05:57.605 --> 01:05:58.540The Alliance: until41001:05:58.710 --> 01:06:09.689The Alliance: enough people in pump through your program to be like, Oh, fuck, yeah, yeah, if you were really, you know, you want to take, you know, 5 5 shots off your game.41101:06:09.870 --> 01:06:28.520The Alliance: you know, a month over there with Rick and and like. Then it's a different game. But like that's why I was saying right out the gate I build in snowy environments because you're the only show in town that you'll get the customers to get the word out, but because until it comes out you're a novelty competing with golf.41201:06:28.630 --> 01:06:32.079The Alliance: And so it's, how long can you get people to good performance? And41301:06:33.090 --> 01:06:43.029The Alliance: I I mean, maybe your voodoo is really good. But my experience like there's no single fix that's gonna actually like, improve your golf game. That fast.41401:06:43.030 --> 01:06:43.350Rick Sessinghaus: Right.41501:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.009The Alliance: Maybe you're that good.41601:06:45.210 --> 01:07:02.600Rick Sessinghaus: I'm good, but my demographic of elite juniors and college players. The low hanging fruit is them getting college scholarships, and I've done a very good job. So the parents are the ones that are paying for it, and they're going to do anything for little Johnny to get that college scholarship, and they know that I'm 1 of the best in the business to41701:07:02.710 --> 01:07:06.975Rick Sessinghaus: get that learning curve and stuff like that. So that's part of it. But I'll.41801:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.059The Alliance: I like that. I mean, I just I still think41901:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.140The Alliance: the place where the weather's a little more inclement, does you?42001:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.650The Alliance: Oh, just42101:07:15.800 --> 01:07:21.259The Alliance: helps. It just helps. It gives you a little bit of an edge. I could be wrong. That's how I would think about it.42201:07:21.260 --> 01:07:24.269Rick Sessinghaus: Could be alright. Thank you. Thank you.42301:07:24.270 --> 01:07:29.050The Alliance: We'll see. I'll see you. I'm gonna be. I'm gonna pop on the call a little bit next Thursday. So42401:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.559The Alliance: you are going to 100 step out.42501:07:33.420 --> 01:07:34.260The Alliance: Both.42601:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.230Rick Sessinghaus: Projects and layer in your personality. Stuff on top of it.42701:07:39.747 --> 01:07:51.879The Alliance: You're gonna continue with the with the everything else, and it doesn't seem like, have you been playing with the flow triggers of the monthly concentration and carving yourself out time, distraction, management.42801:07:52.407 --> 01:07:54.069Rick Sessinghaus: Not as much as I will.42901:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.340The Alliance: Okay. Lean back in.43001:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.719The Alliance: See? You soon.43101:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.140Rick Sessinghaus: Thanks, sir.43201:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.890The Alliance: Thank you, sir.
