WEBVTT100:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.500The Alliance: Hello!200:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.400The Alliance: There you are!300:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.160The Alliance: Hello! Hi!400:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.370The Alliance: Good morning!500:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.690Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Good morning. How are you.600:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.709The Alliance: I'm well. How are you?700:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.890Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Good.800:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.130The Alliance: Nice.900:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.660The Alliance: Hey, look what you get. Yeah, look what you get, hey? Geek1000:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.819The Alliance: stick I've got. I've got creatures in here. Normally, I just have creature, but I've got creatures.1100:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.830The Alliance: Oh, that's fine.1200:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.911The Alliance: But so I want to start where I always want to start. These conversations, which is1300:02:01.860 --> 00:02:19.999The Alliance: my methodology. The fire hose approach as a little rhyme or reason. In that I want to see what's stuck. Oftentimes what sticks is a really great place to think about as a starting point for stuff. So I wanted to start there and then get into your stuff.1400:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.459Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Sounds great love it.1500:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.235The Alliance: What stuck, what resonated, what has been immediately actionable? What has,1600:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.760The Alliance: at least made you stop and think, etc.1700:02:35.231 --> 00:02:39.949Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, I think, I knew I needed more discipline.1800:02:41.205 --> 00:02:48.910Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So i was really excited to you know, kind of get that like do these things in your day, because I think sometimes otherwise I just end up.1900:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.889Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I don't know kind of thinking too much.2000:02:50.990 --> 00:03:01.570Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I'm going down rabbit holes. So I feel like that was really helpful for me. Because then I can just make the list the night before.2100:03:02.540 --> 00:03:18.187Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: just like you said right. And then the next day, it's like, Okay, now make sure you do the whole list. And I really like to know the why behind making the list and making sure you do the whole damn list, because because that helps me.2200:03:18.830 --> 00:03:29.129Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: you know, kind of not make excuses for myself or not be like, Oh, whatever it doesn't matter, because it's like, Oh, this actually really does matter that you do these things in this way, because this is what it does in your brain.2300:03:29.240 --> 00:03:42.149Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I love knowing the why. With that, and I think to you know something that I have been working on, but that got stronger with what we learned is the you know, kind of2400:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.450Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: doing the things with your body and your brain2500:03:49.150 --> 00:04:07.939Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: in a I don't know how to word this. But like you know how, when you're always thinking it's like that, you know, kind of analytical thinking intelligence. But it's like just trusting that like when you're doing like the drawing with your hands, or when you're doing like the meditation, or like this, you know, kind of the active recovery stuff that there's an2600:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.389Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: almost like an intelligence in that that our brain can't make sense of. So it's like.2700:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.589Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: but it but it, for sure makes a difference. So kind of noticing2800:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.949Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: that it makes a difference, even though my brain doesn't always, you know, make sense of it. I guess if that makes that makes sense.2900:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.400The Alliance: That makes that makes a lot of sense to me. That's why this is the3000:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.840The Alliance: I mean to me like, in a sense, that's the gold mine. That's the one of the first, st like big gold mines. Because.3100:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.360The Alliance: Abby, sit, sit, sit. It's okay. Yes,3200:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.122The Alliance: Most people struggle with 2 things with peak performance3300:04:50.720 --> 00:05:09.829The Alliance: one. The shit just isn't sexy like, if you're a biohacker who wants to. XY and Z, like you come to this stuff. And you're like, oh, looks like weak sauce, right? Is one. And there's a subcategory there. People who come in through medicine, the body diet.3400:05:09.940 --> 00:05:23.739The Alliance: biohacking mindset do not trust psychological, neurobiological interventions. So there's a bias against all this stuff. For a lot of reasons that are just in the Zeitgeist. They just float around. Problem one problem 2 is3500:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.239The Alliance: it's compound interest.3600:05:26.470 --> 00:05:42.559The Alliance: It's totally invisible, like everything like everything that we're training you is totally fucking, invisible. So until you start seeing it. Oh, whoa! Result? Oh, so the bigger result! Oh, so the bigger. Oh, wow! I've got a tool.3700:05:42.720 --> 00:05:52.730The Alliance: It's a tool I can use it. It's in like when I need it. I have a tool right? And what's cool about the tools, and why this compounds so much is3800:05:53.150 --> 00:06:09.489The Alliance: your brain is a safety and security hunting mechanism right? And a tool means I know how to fish. I don't have to beg for fish. The brain actually calms the fuck down even more. It lowers mortisol release even more because you've actually skilled up.3900:06:10.020 --> 00:06:24.990Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, yeah. And and there's something with that, too. It's like the skill. But also what? What came to me, too. It's it's almost like you kind of over time, you all of a sudden. You're like, oh, like, that's not even something I I realized I needed. But now that I've done it.4000:06:25.190 --> 00:06:32.219Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: You're much better able to like to almost kind of like to sense when you need to do it versus.4100:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.690The Alliance: Yeah.4200:06:32.690 --> 00:06:43.149Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It's not intuitive right from the start, but once you've been doing it, then it it almost forms that habit of like, oh, now I'm actually missing it, because I felt so much better when I was doing it.4300:06:43.260 --> 00:07:08.940Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And then you're more likely to keep doing it, you know. But but yeah, it's like, for sure, that upfront work of like getting a new baseline getting a new normal. And then, yeah, like, I have found, yeah, like, I'm much more sensitive to be like. Oh, no, I need to do like a meditation, or I need to go for a walk, or or I recognize where my nervous system is, you know, and then I just need to bring it down before I try to think anymore, or whatever it is. So yeah, that's made a big difference, for sure.4400:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.453The Alliance: You know, when I'm doing a lot of famous guys shit podcasts for example, on book tour,4500:07:15.520 --> 00:07:33.459The Alliance: one, because, this helps me, not get divorced, and 2, because it helps me not say the wrong thing. In between interviews. Run up the mountain behind my house, I mean, like I have like. I go up as fast as I can, and come back down and do the next interview like what dial off and do the next interview, because it'll flush the dopamine out.4600:07:33.460 --> 00:07:50.370The Alliance: and I don't wanna one. You ride the dopamine high. Your ego just blows up but 2, you lose perspective and you start saying things in interviews that are like arrogant and stupid, and you shouldn't say and so I like, you know, I do. Action resets when the dopamine spikes sometimes, too.4700:07:50.370 --> 00:08:13.620Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's so cool. That's a good idea, because I find I'll get really excited about ideas. And then I'm like, Oh, God! There's some kind of dopamine, and then I'll one thing I used to be really bad about. But since learning, you know from you, it's like, Okay, make sure you're not like, you know, kind of yapping about it to everybody, because then that you know, then that's like enough to kind of to kill the like the motivation to actually do it.4800:08:13.620 --> 00:08:23.829Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So that's where yeah, like, you were saying, it's like, not sexy, not exciting, but what I what I found really important for me to just kind of have that expectation.4900:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.729The Alliance: Let me hold on. Let me ask you a question.5000:08:26.260 --> 00:08:36.969The Alliance: You noticed when the urge to come up and tell somebody about something comes up and you don't. Have you noticed that it actually, you get an increased sense of power on the inside. Have you found that yet?5100:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.110Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So watch it.5200:08:39.110 --> 00:08:54.189The Alliance: Yeah, watch it next time you're doing it. Notice what happens inside you. There's actually like you feel it's literally like you could. I feel like the battery is charging like I could feel like it's they say.5300:08:54.190 --> 00:09:10.160The Alliance: and I don't know if this is true or not, but they say sexual energy and creative energy are very similar. They're sort of the same energy, right? And maybe this is not sexual energy creative. But maybe this is like when you keep it the goal quiet. It's the same kind of transference. I don't know.5400:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.090Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It is.5500:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.720The Alliance: Alright! So. That is amazing. Anything else.5600:09:16.880 --> 00:09:26.179Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Trying to think. Well, I mean, this is funny, because the 1st week was really good. And then last week, because that was our holiday. So we had last week, Monday off.5700:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.829Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And that's just like5800:09:28.270 --> 00:09:47.119Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: really seemed to completely derail me because I was like, what am I working on? Because the Monday we're with the kids. And then, like, you know, we're busy all weekend. And then it was I didn't get the planning done, even like on Sunday. I didn't really do anything Monday to work towards my goals. And then I was feeling behind.5900:09:47.250 --> 00:10:05.959Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And then, so I was just like, Okay, like. I don't have time to do these things. I just have to get things done. But then I had so much harder, like a like a harder time actually doing the things right. So like, that was where? Then, reflecting on that, I was like, you know, I just really need to make sure I'm making the time to do the things, because already this week, so much better, as far as.6000:10:05.960 --> 00:10:24.969The Alliance: Yeah, when I when I talk about this I'm so glad you're here, the way I talk about this especially in flow for writers, because, like artists, are super flaky, is like. The most important thing in peak performance, as far as I can tell, is to protect your schedule6100:10:25.620 --> 00:10:52.510The Alliance: like. It's the wildest thing in the world, but like everybody I know who does this like you this the one I don't know if it's a downside or upside, but you sort of become like a schedule. Nazi. You're like, no, no, this is. This is exactly how it's got to fit now, like I can't tell you how many fucking jobs I turned down because I knew I needed a nap at about 1230 every day, and there was no way it was gonna happen, and I knew I'd be worthless in the afternoon and piss people off and get fired.6200:10:53.080 --> 00:11:08.620Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that's interesting. Cause, then and then the other thing and I know cause you guys don't have kids right, you said, but that's where I get like sometimes I don't know what to do, so if you have any advice here but so they won't go to bed right now until after 10,6300:11:09.030 --> 00:11:31.450Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: and then. So I find I'm like holy crap. Because then what? Because the days are getting so long here? It's probably similar to you over there. But yeah, so like the days get so long. So the sun's not setting till like for sure, 9, 30 or later. So then they're only going to bed after 10, and then. So I'm kind of yeah. So then I end up going to bed only like around 11. And usually I'd like to wake up for sure by 6,6400:11:32.190 --> 00:11:42.369Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: or even 5, 30 would be so nice. But like with 8 h of sleep by 6. So in the winter. It's not bad. I can usually fall asleep shortly after 9, and then, you know, kind of wake up around 6.6500:11:43.300 --> 00:11:57.279Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But now I find yeah, it'll be 11, and then, so I don't know. Sometimes I'll I'll like, Wake up like this morning. I woke up just before 6, and I was like, Yeah, I feel pretty well rested, but really I had only slept maybe 6 and a half hours.6600:11:57.660 --> 00:12:04.260Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: and then so I feel like, and I know that's not enough, so I don't know. So sometimes it's like hard to manage the mornings.6700:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.450The Alliance: Because.6800:12:05.450 --> 00:12:13.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because I can't control. Because I yeah, like, I can't go to sleep at 9 like I would like. And I'm not even sure this time of year, if if I would be able to, because the sun is up.6900:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.399Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I'm I'm like, really.7000:12:15.400 --> 00:12:31.570The Alliance: 3. So 3 thing, 3 or 4 things on that 1. 1 talk to Ryan. He's the like. When you get out with Ryan. He has kids. He's so he's the guy, like one of the reasons he's my right hand in. This is because there are kids questions. And I I'm not qualified.7100:12:32.100 --> 00:12:40.614The Alliance: but he is, and he's really good with his kids. And he's, you know, Blunt, that's thing, a thing, B, that I will tell you that7200:12:42.100 --> 00:12:48.160The Alliance: I find is very useful is so one7300:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.030The Alliance: you can have one high performance day on no sleep.7400:12:54.180 --> 00:13:06.150The Alliance: It's hard to have 2, but you can, and you can sort of train yourself into it. The secret to training yourself into it is, whatever is your primary task that you're gonna try to focus on for like 90 min deep work thing7500:13:06.550 --> 00:13:34.580The Alliance: because you've been up, you haven't slept enough. Your challenge skills balances off right? So you have to lower the so like if I'm if I don't get enough sleep. Normally, I start a book. I write 500 words, no matter what. No, I'll make it 3 50, because and chances are when I get to 350, I'll keep going. But I want to lower it. So I just calm down really low threshold. Because I know if I make my goal I'll get a little dopamine.7600:13:34.940 --> 00:13:43.979The Alliance: It'll make me a little smarter. I'd be able to go a little farther. But I. So I play. But I lowered the goal. And sometimes I just get to the goal. I'm like, Okay, this is cool. You know what I mean. So the point7700:13:44.310 --> 00:14:11.650The Alliance: is, you can adjust that. I find you could adjust the challenge skills balance on the fly. And sometimes your nervous system really appreciates it like it's really like, oh, you're taking care of me, I get it. But you also don't break the habit of doing the thing every day, which is the most important thing, and you'll find you don't do it 2 days if you could avoid it. But you can get sort of get over mode and method is this Cbd sleep product that we think is the best in the world.7800:14:11.790 --> 00:14:40.340The Alliance: It's it's mode and method. Hrv. Plus. It was developed by our friend Don Moxley, who's sort of the Hrv. Guru of in in sports, and he's no longer with the company, but we all he gave it to us. We were like, Okay, another Cbd supplement what the fuck, you know it's like, no, try it. And we both of us. Now our wives are taking like everybody we're like, Oh, my God! So like, if you do want to get to sleep a little faster, it's a really good sleep aid.7900:14:40.340 --> 00:14:58.445Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I find it fall asleep really easily, I mean, like, as long as it's just the yeah. I find it fall asleep really easily, which is good and and like. For the 1st time in probably like 12 years since I started having kids, I'm actually sleeping through the night again, which I always used to wake up at 3 in the morning like with anxiety.8000:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.360The Alliance: Yeah.8100:14:59.360 --> 00:15:17.368Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But now I'm finally sleeping straight through. So like last night I slept probably from 11 right through to, you know, 5, 30, but or I'll sleep. Yeah, right? Yeah. So, anyway. But yeah, no, that sounds good. I'll look it up right now. I try to take. I don't know. There's like a valerian route one. It's like a mushroom blend because I'm into the mushrooms. But8200:15:17.820 --> 00:15:25.849Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I do sometimes feel like if my mind is already a little bit active. The Valerian will make it even more active. So.8300:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.923The Alliance: The other thing that I've found is8400:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.570The Alliance: awesome is the declutter, the line guy.8500:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.060The Alliance: as a couple of them for sleep.8600:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.690Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, I'll look at it, too.8700:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.480The Alliance: And I like.8800:15:40.600 --> 00:15:48.160The Alliance: because I I always do his stuff right at the end of the day, like as soon as people stop taxing my nervous system8900:15:48.620 --> 00:15:58.840The Alliance: right? So it's like, finish my day. Go in checking my wife, make sure everything is cool, and there's no secret crisis lurking right, and then9000:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.310The Alliance: start my active recovery with like9100:16:01.890 --> 00:16:16.599The Alliance: a meditation in a sauna, because it like, now I know nothing's gonna upset my nervous system so I can calm it down, and usually like sometimes with that, like, if I've had a long day, I can literally go like meditation. Sauna. Food, sleep like.9200:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.820The Alliance: you know. Maybe I'll read for 15 min, and like it's that like, I can really shut it down pretty fast.9300:16:21.820 --> 00:16:45.769Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, yeah. And I like, and I know. Cause that's the thing I'm trying to figure out, too. So right now, what I do is I like my my ideal morning is like I would wake up and then maybe do like maybe 5 min on the assault bike and and then go straight to the Sauna and then do my walk outside and then get the kids on the bus, and then when the kids are gone, then I can, you know? Go right into my flow block like that's what's ideal.9400:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.669The Alliance: Yeah, it sounds like a. It sounds like a dope schedule.9500:16:48.900 --> 00:16:58.501Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, is it? Okay? Cause like what I actually think I'd probably rather do, because sometimes then I'll I'll skip the Sauna. I'll skip. You know the workout, but but I always make sure to do the walk because the dog needs it. But9600:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.950Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: What I'd almost rather do is like, wake up and have 90 min to work before I get the kids on the bus, but because I wake up at such random times.9700:17:07.555 --> 00:17:07.900The Alliance: But9800:17:07.900 --> 00:17:27.110The Alliance: I think you're gonna I think with the kids are a little young. You may not like, I think this is a I don't I agree with you? And you're right, and maybe that could be your weekend schedule. But I don't think it's gonna be your midweek schedule but the thing you might want to consider also. Just for fun of it is when you hike your dog by a weight vest.9900:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.710Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, yeah, I should do that. Yes.10000:17:29.710 --> 00:17:49.019The Alliance: I do it all the time, and it's like Ab and Quad training for free, because I'm walking the dog anyways, right? So like it's 1 of the ways I super train for ski season. Is. I put it on a weight vest. My dog walks, which have to my release hike, and if you keep the the trick is10100:17:49.610 --> 00:17:54.370The Alliance: the 1st hike, you're gonna feel it, whatever. But I know with like like10200:17:56.420 --> 00:18:20.230The Alliance: today, I hiked in a 12 pound vest. It's super light, right? I barely notice 12 pounds. I don't want to work out. I want it to be a release activity, but just a little bit more, because it also helps me sleep at night, and on the days that I can't get to the gym for as long as I want, or any of that stuff. I've already ticked the hike, the workout box a.10300:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.300Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Little bit more. Yeah, that's right.10400:18:22.300 --> 00:18:34.399The Alliance: This is like today. My Tuesdays are days. I can't. I work? I I'm gonna go on meetings till 6 o'clock today with my editor, so I had to like my one shot was like put on the way. Best goes straight up the mountain, you know.10500:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.070Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It's.10600:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.110The Alliance: 6 am.10700:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.480Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.10800:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.853The Alliance: All right. So what? All right, what sg, brand, couple of10900:18:42.310 --> 00:18:48.900The Alliance: big, heavy things that we can help move up the mountain. What can we help move up the mountain for you today?11000:18:49.140 --> 00:19:05.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Well, I guess. Okay, so this is my thing. I guess, like, I'm I'm not really sure if this is like, I don't know, like an ask, or I just kinda wanna get an idea of like what your thoughts and opinion are about these things, because I think like I've I spoke in kind of my on onboarding and stuff. I think like I'm doing this11100:19:06.230 --> 00:19:16.828Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: flow for leaders thing like a like a flow for teams, or, like, you know, kind of organizations. And what this program looks like right now, from what I'm building, it's like, there's this.11200:19:17.210 --> 00:19:38.580Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: this, what I've been calling like a finding flow, 101 which covers 3 main areas. So the 1st area is getting people to understand what's happening with their survival biology, because again, knowledge to me is power, and I think not enough. People actually get into like the nitty, gritty knowledge and actually teach people. So they have that sense of autonomy.11300:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.910Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And then the second part is self leadership. Because this whole thing, I think11400:19:42.940 --> 00:20:08.779Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: a lot of the problems in the world right now are because there's leadership problems in including a lack of self leadership. And again, it's it's not that people. They just don't have the skills right? No one actually teaches them. I mean, some people do. But I think that's that's a huge area. And then the 3rd component of this yeah kind of finding flow 101 is flow biology. So like your biology to thrive. So again, just kind of understanding that. And then making steps towards actually11500:20:08.780 --> 00:20:18.779Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: taking the self leadership to apply that knowledge and then start seeing those effects in their lives. So that's like one component of this flow for leaders program, because, like11600:20:18.900 --> 00:20:25.660Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: my target audience is leaders, because I really like the idea of helping people who help people right for the ripple effects.11700:20:25.840 --> 00:20:52.969Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Something that drives me is that you know kind of impact. And then the kind of second phase is that, okay? So once these leaders are able to kind of embody that and have that knowledge. They're able to then apply that to the people they lead. And then there's that component to that. But then there's also this, like, what do you need within your, you know, kind of organization within your team. For again, maximum flow.11800:20:53.030 --> 00:20:59.819Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And yeah, kind of like an like a maximum ability for this to actually work for people. Because I think11900:21:00.040 --> 00:21:17.159Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: once you put certain things in place, they work well because they work with people's biology, which is kind of what I've seen with my own organization, right? It's like, Oh, why did that work well? And looking back now, I can see it's because it actually works with people's biology. So people adopt it because it feels good. And then it's just like an easy and easy thing to have, like, you know, a good win.12000:21:17.950 --> 00:21:27.169Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So, anyway, describing all that, that's something I'm building, and and I want to get out to people. But then I was, you know, kind of, because.12100:21:27.320 --> 00:21:51.879Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like you and the flow research collective. And you guys, you know, you want to get flow out to people as well. And that type of stuff. So then I was like, how cool would it be, and how much more of an impact, how much more effective, and how much more you know, kind of furthering my mission and also helping with your kind of Frc's mission, or whether it's your mission or or whether there's someone else, you know, that might be into this to actually work with someone to12200:21:52.140 --> 00:22:05.600Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: develop it and make it like really legitimate. I mean, like not saying me doing. It is not going to be legitimate, but you know, just kind of have that backing, and and that, you know, kind of extra bit of that kind of input.12300:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.742Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And then to actually12400:22:08.610 --> 00:22:20.600Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: trial it, right? Like, it's like a program, a method that could be developed and then proven to be effective to help leaders lead their teams like less burnout. Higher engagement, you know, kind of overall life12500:22:20.710 --> 00:22:30.344Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: life fulfillment. And I mean, there's all the metrics you can track like even business profitability, you know, kind of team engagement. There's all kinds of things you can track to see if it's working.12600:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.530Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But yeah. So I guess that's kind of what I wanted to ask you is like, what would.12700:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.048The Alliance: How, how much, what kind of answer do you want for me on this?12800:22:39.300 --> 00:22:46.110Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I guess, because I've never really worked with anyone before. But I want to, because I really want12900:22:47.412 --> 00:22:58.440Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, kind of somewhere to bounce ideas off and stuff. But I guess that's the thing like like, I don't need any specific answer. I just kind of was wondering if, like that is something that you, or13000:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.630Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: so collective.13100:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.350The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, I mean, Stephanie, you have to. You have to understand that like, oh.13200:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.267The Alliance: my entire brand has been built with13300:23:08.990 --> 00:23:26.229The Alliance: the top scientists. So the collective is the top neuroscientists in the world. And the coaches we hired were all really really high level. Phd, psychologists best in the world. Our training13400:23:27.560 --> 00:23:42.203The Alliance: well, 0 to dangerous is exactly. I mean, like, we've trained more C-suite leaders than anybody else in the world. Using a neuroscience based blueprint for peak performance, which was my core idea when I created it. So13500:23:43.080 --> 00:24:06.069The Alliance: Like all we did it. We've we've we did it in a giant scale. We're probably gonna relaunch something. I you know, I pulled I all the only reason I I didn't like running. I didn't like a hundred person team was sick of it, as I said and the model got wobbly, and I just looked at as the opportunity to collapse it. And we're gonna build something else.13600:24:06.396 --> 00:24:17.480The Alliance: That is probably flow for the many that goes wide. I don't know when I don't know what that looks like and I may do something before I do that tethered to like13700:24:17.480 --> 00:24:31.627The Alliance: the book I have coming out Peter Diamandis, and a little bit some of the flow and AI stuff. So I don't like I don't know which direction I'm going in. But here's what I wanna like here. There's there's a bunch of things. I'm just gonna send you really quickly.13800:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.410Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.13900:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.409The Alliance: That are my business. Alarm bells.14000:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.120The Alliance: Why.14100:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.570Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And.14200:24:35.570 --> 00:24:58.669The Alliance: Same reason I can't partner with you at the Flow Research Collective is, I don't trust you as a leader, and I don't trust you as a flow authority, yet I trust you as a vet. Somebody who's growing a vet business, and I like your personality, and I bet you're good on stage, and I'll bet you're pretty good on podcasts like, I bet those things are are possibly true. But I don't think you have a clue about what you're trying to do.14300:24:58.670 --> 00:25:13.730The Alliance: I think you have no idea like you're going into a world like, Oh, I'm gonna build the training. And I'm gonna train people and flow. You're literally competing against me and the best people in the world at this. So you can do that. I'm not saying Don't do that. I'm saying.14400:25:14.270 --> 00:25:26.100The Alliance: understand that that's what you're trying to do. And it's a full time job for you and a whole bunch of staff. Who are, you know my staff is our our best in the world. You know what I mean, and that's14500:25:26.100 --> 00:25:26.540The Alliance: just about14600:25:26.540 --> 00:25:48.659The Alliance: me, that's all the other people in this. So I don't want you to go in blind thinking you have to like. There's a business side of this which is okay. If I want to train leaders, how am I gonna get to those leaders, you know, even if you're doing it as friendly and as a nonprofit, as a sharing information like, how are you even gonna get in those rooms. And why would they listen to you.14700:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.111The Alliance: though? So on a business side, I go. Huh? That doesn't make any sense to me14800:25:54.680 --> 00:26:21.999The Alliance: a personal side. I'm always like more the merrier man like I got into this because I wanted, you know, really smart people thinking about these fucking problems, just thinking about them correctly. So. And I I have an abundance mindset. So I'm like, if you can add to the fucking conversation, I think I just want to remind people is thought leader is not a title. It doesn't actually mean you stand on a stage and open your mouth. It means you legitimately lead. It means you have to have legitimate14900:26:22.260 --> 00:26:44.950The Alliance: your own ideas. They have to be published so other people can bang on them, and that means they have to be, not self published, but credibly published. So you go through the gatekeeper of a publisher, and they approve right like there's that's what thought leaders do. They don't try to cheat around corners with self publishing books or making lots of Youtube videos. They said, No, no, I'm really going to lead from the front15000:26:44.950 --> 00:27:05.610The Alliance: with my ideas, and that's so. I'm not saying, Don't jump in, please jump in right, and I'm not saying there won't be an opportunity down the road with something we do, because there might be. I have no fucking clue. That's 1 of the things the alliance is for. You know what I mean, like, let's meet some people and see what everybody's doing on the other side. I would say you should probably talk to Brian Cabastral in the group15100:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.240The Alliance: who's sort of there's a bunch of people15200:27:09.174 --> 00:27:21.802The Alliance: and a totally Brian Camstral, Courtney and a handful of others who are all sort of like different phases of I'd like to do flow, you know, different things. And15300:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.979The Alliance: one, you guys might wanna15400:27:28.060 --> 00:27:38.271The Alliance: think about figuring out doing some stuff together. I have no idea. I'm always worried about partners. I'm very cautious with my partners. I've learned15500:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.077The Alliance: there's a lot of people in the group who are poking at this.15600:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.819The Alliance: The the one thing I will tell you, and this is where I would start with you is15700:27:47.970 --> 00:27:56.310The Alliance: what you are missing is the low hanging fruit, which is low for bets low for15800:27:56.782 --> 00:28:21.280The Alliance: people who work with animals flow for people. Who are, you know, on, on, like the because you already have expertise there like now. Well, no, you are a fucking vet, and you do speak about that stuff, and you are growing your business, and if it continues to grow, or you partner with Bruce, you know what I mean now, sort of like, and I'm not saying you can't go for leaders in like15900:28:21.680 --> 00:28:31.339The Alliance: 5 to 10. But like you could, you should build from what your strengths are if you can, and I, maybe you have other strengths outside of vets. And there's other communities you sort of plugged into where you16000:28:31.340 --> 00:28:31.890The Alliance: yeah.16100:28:31.890 --> 00:29:00.497The Alliance: that much authority and could launch there, I'm just saying, don't make it crazy for yourself. Understand? These are all super competitive marketplaces, and as much as it feels good on the inside. Don't get your dreams dashed on the like real world like, no, this is a different business. I'm starting a new company in a new vertical know that, like your skills, decline an additional 10 to 20% for every 10. You get away from your core field. So people don't realize that.16200:29:00.890 --> 00:29:12.680The Alliance: they they there's a skill drift. I'm not saying you can't skill up. But like we lose skills the farther we get away from our core, our core strikes and things like that. And people don't like blind. Do it.16300:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.240Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes.16400:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.310The Alliance: Especially when there's a lot of dopamine and passion involved.16500:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.070Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.16600:29:18.746 --> 00:29:23.030The Alliance: Right? You know, like16700:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.650The Alliance: I would start by asking questions like. So, for example, my lab proved, blow overrides16800:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.892The Alliance: Ptsd. Karina fiber's lab proved, it overwrites burnout16900:29:36.090 --> 00:29:45.110The Alliance: group in Europe, proved it overwrites or neuroprotective against anxiety and depression, etc, etc. So this is all this is all proved in the past 2 years.17000:29:47.140 --> 00:29:52.919The Alliance: If that's true. Well, that's some of the highest instance of17100:29:53.050 --> 00:30:10.629The Alliance: burnout some Ptsd. If they work on, you know, and it depends on what kind of animal cases you work on. But I know a bunch of vets with Ptsd. From seeing horrific shit as well, so like, there's a anxiety. There's a bunch of stuff that vets suffer from. So what happens if you do a like17200:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.959The Alliance: create a small flow training for vets and measure it. See, you know.17300:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.060Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, pre, and like.17400:30:16.060 --> 00:30:45.860The Alliance: That's where I start. I'm like, Okay, you wanna like, you want to be a thought leader. Cool? Yeah, like you, you're a scientist. You know how to run experiment like you know what I mean, or you're not a partner of people who can run those experiments you like. If you, if you, if we want to like a vet experiment, will I help you like? Well, can we help you run that? Yeah, we I mean, you know what I mean, like we can. If that gets up and running, we can like, get on the paper with you, and like can start that stuff we would love, I would love to do, and.17500:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.260Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.17600:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.809The Alliance: And help you sort of build credibility like I to me, it's17700:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.710The Alliance: the other thing. Is this, like you.17800:30:55.520 --> 00:31:20.179The Alliance: you have to. You're gonna have to really do the reading. I mean, like, really do the reading right? Like, there's a bunch of like this. If you really want to do this, especially if you want to stand on the on the neurobiology platform like, there are so many actual things about the brain in the various systems. You need to know and you should also, by the way, I watched your onboarding video.17900:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.010The Alliance: There are massive problems in the trauma world18000:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.420The Alliance: from a like Vander. Cult's a liar flat out like he's a liar.18100:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.789Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: When you said that I was like, Oh, my gosh! I need to.18200:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.210The Alliance: Alive.18300:31:34.660 --> 00:31:53.460The Alliance: He's a liar. Gabor Monte is not to be trusted. Not that he's a bad dude. He's just tiny sample size, and he really wants it to be true. And he's, you know. But yeah, like, look at that stuff. Because the trauma stuff you gotta like. If if the thing to do is read up18400:31:54.039 --> 00:32:00.870The Alliance: George's book, Bonanno's book. Who's on resilience? What's it called? It's right behind me, I think.18500:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.169The Alliance: Where is it? Damn it.18600:32:05.120 --> 00:32:24.759The Alliance: all right. Venano's at Columbia. He's the world's leading expert trauma and resilience. He's the guy who study Vanderkoult basterized. So read resilience like, and read the actual study, and then go back and see what Vandergolt said about it in the book, and you'd be like. Oh, see why they're pissed. I get it now.18700:32:24.760 --> 00:32:41.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah thing that I love. Yeah, like. And that's kind of where I was at. Because I I don't know, because I've been around a lot of people that do a lot of like online courses and stuff with that stuff. But I'm like, where's like the science? And is it actually true, and like it seems to work, but sometimes I'm like it's not enough. So then that's where.18800:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.271The Alliance: I would also tell you18900:32:43.860 --> 00:33:10.780The Alliance: oddly so. There's a there's a bunch of textbooks that I could recommend. But the when I was coming into flow science. When I knew I knew a bunch of stuff I probably read most of 6 70 high stuff. I met the other literature, but I read so Michael Posner is the god of attention. He was the University of Oregon, and he there's the cognitive neuroscience of attention, volumes 1, 2, and 3. They're textbooks.19000:33:10.780 --> 00:33:35.159The Alliance: Volume one to me was the single, most worthwhile textbook I ever read while trying to learn peak performance, neuroscience, because it's the foundation of the attention system, and everything runs off attention one way or another, right? And like I find it. I found I found that a hugely, hugely helpful. I mean, there's a ton of neurotox books, but that's the one19100:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.150The Alliance: that I'm like, yeah, that one really like.19200:33:38.330 --> 00:33:49.320The Alliance: I don't know if it was just my brain was ready for all that information, and just stitched it all together. But that was the 1st time I remember thinking, Oh, wow! Now I can actually think inside of flow neuroscience for the 1st time19300:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.957The Alliance: at a deeper level was that was that textbook. So19400:33:54.540 --> 00:34:02.070The Alliance: I think, like, I think everything is you're you're doing is totally doable. I just want you to like, come up with a19500:34:02.230 --> 00:34:14.320The Alliance: path that actually gets you like when you get there right, because nothing I like talk to. There are people I'm not going to name names. There are people in the Alliance who have built trainings.19600:34:15.239 --> 00:34:29.970The Alliance: and they're pretty qualified, and they've done gone nowhere. They'd like. Put them out there, and they can't do anything with them, because they don't like. It's a business, and it's not even the greatest business to be in like you know what I mean like. If I if I could avoid selling trainings, I19700:34:30.330 --> 00:34:39.669The Alliance: might. I like the alliance, but like it's kind of a weird like, it's a weird thing to be in. You know what I mean.19800:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Passion, I mean, like my main business.19900:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.789The Alliance: Clients who come to you. You don't have to chase clients as much.20000:34:45.790 --> 00:34:58.340Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I know. And and that's where I mean, obviously, like my main money making and everything is is always going to be owning vet clinics, because that's just where I make my money. But it but it is such a passion to like help help people because I was there right.20100:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.669The Alliance: Well, but there's also so. But there's also like, so there's20200:35:01.920 --> 00:35:10.199The Alliance: there's the other thing is this, there's all this. So you know, people get into flow. I will, if you've read small furry prayer, you know, people get into flow with their animals.20300:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.670The Alliance: Oh, yeah.20400:35:10.670 --> 00:35:20.510The Alliance: it's really healing to the animals, and it's really healing to the people like there's nobody like you know what I mean like. That's another one where it flows right off your vet work20500:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.489The Alliance: into something and natural. So there's a lot of like.20600:35:24.010 --> 00:35:29.966The Alliance: there's a lot of ways to build from where you are to sort of where you want to go20700:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.389The Alliance: and here's the cool thing that I will tell you.20800:35:34.540 --> 00:35:42.460The Alliance: and you sort of know this most vets are way funkier than doctors20900:35:42.810 --> 00:35:54.029The Alliance: they tend to be. They tend to be funkier, more interesting people, a little more open mind. They're not all of them, but as a general rule. So you actually have a group who's sort of21000:35:54.785 --> 00:35:56.779The Alliance: like it's it's a good group to21100:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.912The Alliance: sort reach into, because they're not as closed off as some of the other stuff.21200:36:04.690 --> 00:36:22.429The Alliance: and the problem with the leader thing also is one of the reasons I stopped doing business to business stuff is, yeah, you can speak at big leadership conferences. And there's that sort of stuff. But like, if you want to go into companies and work with companies, I want you to jump to like a year's worth of hoops.21300:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.230The Alliance: Build this slide deck, build this slide deck, do it this, tell me, and like no fuck off.21400:36:28.230 --> 00:36:54.079Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, thinking, it would be more so like marketed towards, like, like, yeah, kind of if, like, someone would want to take it. But I guess. Yeah, because, like what you were saying about like the vet stuff, I mean, that's kind of where I was like, yeah, it makes the most sense for me, of course, to to start in there. Because and there's huge vet corporations, and it's like I'm hoping like an easier sell, because it's there is so much burnout, and, you know, kind of suicide, event, and all these things. So it is.21500:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.589The Alliance: No, it's it's a huge. I mean, it's a huge market.21600:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.450The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, huge market.21700:37:00.697 --> 00:37:15.289Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Where I was. I was hoping, yeah, cause like, with the program, basically trying to get almost like one of the Vet corps to be like, okay, like, can we try this with some of your clinics and like that type of thing? So I guess that's where I was like, I mean. It's just me coming and being21800:37:15.860 --> 00:37:22.630Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: worked in my clinic. And this worked from like my friends clinics. I have a few friends that are like, yes, we want to do this, you know, cause I mean, like I have like.21900:37:22.630 --> 00:37:31.259The Alliance: Well, that's I mean, I mean, you gotta understand. If you can get like 3 or 4 like, that's a pilot study that I mean like, that's how you know what I mean like that.22000:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.380Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's yeah. That's.22100:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.190The Alliance: More than enough to start changing minds, and you know what I mean.22200:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.270Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Like.22300:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.600The Alliance: It is.22400:37:37.600 --> 00:37:51.482Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hoping to do, and then get in with, like the bigger corporations where I can do a better job like tracking cause more controls right like. So something like veg in the States. I don't know if you've ever been to a veg clinic like a vet emergency group clinic. Have you ever been to one of those. But anyway, it's22500:37:52.047 --> 00:38:21.152Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, like, they're down there. They have like hundreds of clinics. So it's like, Okay, well, like, could we try this because they already have a good like, a like, a lot of good onboarding systems in place. So it's like, okay, just insert this in your onboarding or something, and then I don't know. So I I was thinking about that, and then just seeing if that would be something that they would be into, because it would ideally, you know, if if they're just looking at profit, it's theoretically should help with that. But also like the team engagement and stuff. So anyway.22600:38:21.430 --> 00:38:26.899The Alliance: I think you could also, like Bruce probably would like, let us test some stuff on somebody.22700:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.180Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's what I was wondering. Yeah, I meet with Bruce on Friday. And22800:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.190Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, with Bruce. Yeah, like, I'm gonna see what he thinks cause22900:38:35.320 --> 00:38:43.179Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: when I initially talked to him like he seems a little more old school as far as like, oh, no, they just have to. And I was like, Oh, God! Like everyone's so burnt out in this.23000:38:43.180 --> 00:38:49.350The Alliance: Yeah, but I gotta tell you something. I was talking. He have you talked about his? What? His vision for the vet clinic of the future is.23100:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.220Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes.23200:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.880The Alliance: Preventative. The preventative medicine like it's a total. So like it's the most cutting.23300:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.459The Alliance: It's so cutting edge as a23400:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.169The Alliance: redesign. If it works. If you could do it.23500:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.679Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Like people have tried it like, that's where, when he's talking about it. I'm like, Oh, people tried that. And it's like.23600:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.310The Alliance: Oh, really.23700:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.224Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right now. It's like, it's like,23800:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.360Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah. Cause lots of people have tried wellness plans and and and like, I was trying to tell them. But like.23900:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.230The Alliance: Does it work.24000:39:14.230 --> 00:39:26.620Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But I still think it's possible like it. It works in the horse world, it seems like, but it's like they buy a package once a year, and then they, and then they deliver the things throughout the year that seems to work. They've tried wellness plans for small Med.24100:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.769Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: What I find the newest generation, or right, like the younger generation. They really like.24200:39:33.590 --> 00:39:53.269Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: they go online. And they make a decision on what they want, based on what's Google? Right? So they don't often listen to the vets as much. They listen to everything else. But when it's the time to come, like if their animal is sick, they'll come in and they'll spend a bunch then. So it's like, is there an opportunity for like a subscription or this or that? And I think that's great. But when I look.24300:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.000The Alliance: Oh, you guys, are, gonna you guys are gonna have good conversations.24400:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.500Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, yeah. On Friday we have a we have a meeting, but when I look at vet, med, so it's not hard to get24500:40:04.630 --> 00:40:15.820Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: clients, because there's not that many vets. The the full strategy with the business is actually to keep the team healthy, engaged not quitting low turnover. So my main focus.24600:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.230The Alliance: Oh, yeah.24700:40:16.230 --> 00:40:19.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Is on the team. So that's why, when I go.24800:40:19.040 --> 00:40:19.519The Alliance: Stephanie, we.24900:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.100Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Cool stuff.25000:40:20.100 --> 00:40:26.359The Alliance: We we that was our one of our biggest findings is employee25100:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.764The Alliance: traction goes up because people want to work in high flow places right.25200:40:32.110 --> 00:40:32.470Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Good.25300:40:32.470 --> 00:40:42.539The Alliance: Retention goes up. Here's where things get interesting, though. This is the weird ass fucking, finding in the whole thing. So it turns out25400:40:42.890 --> 00:40:48.600The Alliance: the size flow. People are very much driven by autonomy.25500:40:48.840 --> 00:41:09.857The Alliance: so they are not driven by the mission of the corporation. They will not align with your purpose. They're gonna keep their fucking purpose. So you have to like, they're never yours. Basically like the highest flow people are. Never gonna be your. They're never gonna be the employees you get to like ride into the sunset with25600:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.040Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.25700:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.140The Alliance: But so that's the one interesting dynamic in there, all right. So that's really interesting, though.25800:41:17.444 --> 00:41:22.919The Alliance: Let's not link. I want to best use of your time. I got 20 min left. What's next?25900:41:23.800 --> 00:41:35.249Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Well, there's a question I actually have with that, because, like with the autonomy. So when I'm talking to Bruce, because his whole model is based on okay, like April vets. And then, like, here's the mission, and then they make they bring in owners26000:41:35.520 --> 00:41:42.159Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: that are like, you know, they work, they they own an April vet, right? But then that's where26100:41:42.910 --> 00:42:10.419Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I worry about. You know that exactly is that people who really want to own and be engaged as an owner, and, like, you know, have that be like really fulfilling? They want to set their own mission, their own branding and stuff for their companies. And then that's where I think it's so cool right now, with all the AI stuff I'm like. Wouldn't it be super cool? And this is kind of what I want to ask. Bruce is be like, wouldn't it be super cool to kind of create and like almost like a model where it's like26200:42:11.020 --> 00:42:19.800Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: all the AI systems are set up. And then you get these people in. And it's like, yeah, okay, like this group of 3, like, what do you want your mission to be. What do you want your branding to be? And I and like I get.26300:42:19.940 --> 00:42:26.720Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: you know, that kind of goes against the economies of scale. But is there a way to kind of use? AI26400:42:27.000 --> 00:42:50.110Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: to, you know, balance out what you're losing with economies of scale. And then also you're bringing in more autonomy for the owners, so that they are more engaged, and they are more likely to stay on and like, have more people want to own, because it's like, Oh, yeah, like, I can own my own, my like, literally my own clinic. It's not a string of clinics. Does that make sense what I'm saying?26500:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.179The Alliance: It doesn't. I mean, I don't necessarily know if it makes sense for Bruce, but.26600:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.499Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No, I don't know.26700:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.400The Alliance: And I'm not sure, and26800:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.950The Alliance: I don't see the advantage.26900:43:04.530 --> 00:43:16.080The Alliance: Well, I do see some of the advantage. It's an interesting question. I don't know. I don't know. I like you're you're outside like I'm I'm too outside of like too many. I'm not gonna answer. I don't know. That's an idea.27000:43:16.080 --> 00:43:30.270Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, okay, no, that's fine. That's helpful. Because that's kind of what I was what I was thinking. Cause that's what I see. Wrong with his model, and and I think it's been an opportunity for me to like join him. But then I'm like, Oh, I feel like like that's a big red flag for me that you're making them all the same.27100:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.369The Alliance: I mean I so I know.27200:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.880The Alliance: Here's the one thing I would tell you.27300:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.970The Alliance: There's a guy I know Mike Koenig who does. He's doing one in early June.27400:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.059The Alliance: We're like 40 people. I'll probably do a couple of others. He's the guy like27500:43:46.770 --> 00:44:06.779The Alliance: if you want to know how to like AI out vet clinics, or what? Like everything you're talking about. He's the guy I'd go to because he's the like. He just he's the AI tool. Go, guy he works with like Tony Robbins and all bunch of people like that. And he's just like, what are the tool? How can you use the tools to reinvent your business. He knows more about individual tools.27600:44:07.550 --> 00:44:17.259The Alliance: I can send you the link to his thing, and you probably can't make it in June. But you might be able to go to the next one.27700:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.479Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that'd be cool, because I am taking like a full AI course right now with her name's27800:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.750Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Callen Faulkner, if you've heard of her, but she's.27900:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.760The Alliance: Good. Okay.28000:44:25.760 --> 00:44:39.924Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. So she does a bunch of AI training. So I'm doing a full like, I think it's like a 10 week, week, 3 or 4. And it is. And like, I'm having people from the clinic do it, too. Because I'm like, Okay, we're doing a second clinic next year, like we are going in with this like, with all the AI systems that we can get. So28100:44:40.240 --> 00:44:46.290Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, so it's been interesting. But yeah, no, that's that's perfect. And I think, too. Yeah.28200:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.820The Alliance: By the way, we may do a Mount Hood pop up and.28300:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.660Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay.28400:44:51.660 --> 00:45:17.677The Alliance: July. Hood is in Oregon. It's north of Reed. You fly into Reed and get up to Hood, not quite sure how to do that, because I always drive from here. I don't know how you like Fly, but I'm pretty sure you could just fly in, and somehow but it's a Glacier, and it's park skiing, though the glacier itself is like fun. Intermediate skiing. And you'll have fun on it. And then there's a big ass train park at all levels. And28500:45:18.760 --> 00:45:32.019The Alliance: we're just I'm you know. I'm reteaching myself how to park ski again after 2 years off. So like, oh, we're just thinking about doing a pop up, not 100% certain. But I thought I'd test it and say, Hey, does that? Is that even vaguely interesting.28600:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.960Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That was.28700:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.700The Alliance: In July.28800:45:33.700 --> 00:45:39.030Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. And then I could bring. I don't like, I mean, yeah, like I could bring the kids and and like Dave and stuff, too. They love that stuff.28900:45:39.030 --> 00:45:40.680The Alliance: Oh, you totally! You totally could.29000:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.830Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, because I can't like think.29100:45:43.830 --> 00:45:49.490The Alliance: Cap, the cap that the high cap that's it's fun for kids like it's like, Thank you.29200:45:49.490 --> 00:45:53.770The Alliance: There's yeah. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on. You gotta settle down, I see. Thank you.29300:45:53.770 --> 00:45:59.819Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, that's so cute. Yeah, that'd be really fun, for sure. Let me know, cause I have nothing travel in in July. So.29400:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.029The Alliance: Yeah. I really talked to Ryan this morning. I was like, you know.29500:46:03.630 --> 00:46:18.970The Alliance: last day squall was last week, and I can't go to mammoth. I gotta. I'm out of town all of June. Maybe we should do that July. Pop up. Let's see if we can. I gotta. I gotta try to see if I can do a couple of other things to make it to make it work. But Ryan's working on it, and if you like, now I know there's 1 person interested, so cool.29600:46:18.970 --> 00:46:36.569Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that'd be so fun because I can't make June, which I'm really sad about, because I'm already there. And then I have to like, it's it's like 3 day, I gotta get home because I'm already there the week before that for a whole week. So I yeah, yeah, I'm really sad about June, but well, yeah, no, that's good. And I think.29700:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.309The Alliance: How has working with any of the flow triggers been for you29800:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.060The Alliance: complete concentration, trait, challenge skills, balance.29900:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.410Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.30000:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.479The Alliance: Like you're all on top of what about the other 2.30100:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.299Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, what are the other 2? The.30200:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.695The Alliance: Really concentration. We've been doing distraction management. Has that been working for you?30300:46:56.020 --> 00:47:01.139Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, I've always kind of done that since I did my high flow coaching. I've I've adopted those ones.30400:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.243The Alliance: Okay. Good.30500:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.000Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So, then.30600:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.340The Alliance: No.30700:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.450Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Work, really well.30800:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.500The Alliance: Cool. What else is going on.30900:47:07.264 --> 00:47:22.210Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, no, I think that's good. I think that was my cause. I think, like I was saying with this program, like, I like, I actually want it to be effective. And I want it to be legitimate. So that's where I really wanna make sure all the science is there. So obviously.31000:47:22.833 --> 00:47:24.080The Alliance: Hey! Hey!31100:47:24.450 --> 00:47:25.754Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, the dogs!31200:47:26.190 --> 00:47:30.309The Alliance: In God's name is going on, guys, hey, Kiko?31300:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.660The Alliance: Let's settle it down.31400:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.699The Alliance: Settle down, because oh, I see, there's intruders.31500:47:39.250 --> 00:47:43.370The Alliance: There's intruders disguise his landscapers.31600:47:44.260 --> 00:47:44.690Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's.31700:47:44.690 --> 00:47:45.420The Alliance: Gigo.31800:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.950The Alliance: Hey, good Guy, sit, sit!31900:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.230The Alliance: Oh, I have no power here. Sorry, Stephanie.32000:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.250Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, no, that's okay. I get it. My dog's actually fine right now. So.32100:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.904The Alliance: Go parks a butt park it alright32200:48:01.350 --> 00:48:18.280Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because, yeah, so like, I guess that's the last thing. Yeah, like, I would just love to hit on again is cakes, because that's kind of what I why, I wanted to ask you because I wanted you to kind of feel like these would be the things that would make me feel like this would be like a legitimate thing, because I do eventually want it to be something, you know, that is kind of.32300:48:18.280 --> 00:48:18.640The Alliance: Yeah.32400:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.949Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It's really good.32500:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.369The Alliance: I'm gonna give. I'm gonna give you a homework assignment here.32600:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, good. I love this.32700:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.030The Alliance: Gonna yeah, we're gonna cover. So32800:48:26.980 --> 00:48:46.559The Alliance: if I could start us over again, I would have done the 1st session on creative path finding, which is, we covered a lot, anyways, which is sort of like the framework for going from mission level goal all the way down to clear goals. But there's really, there are like actual things you can do at each step. You've got32900:48:47.710 --> 00:48:55.339The Alliance: pretty clear stack of massively transformative per or not massively transformative purposes higher goals33000:48:56.390 --> 00:49:04.679The Alliance: like right scale, the vet clinic being one of them sort of establish some kind of flow leadership that33100:49:04.960 --> 00:49:17.580The Alliance: authority built into flow leadership authority right like it's there's a stack. They're not all related, but they're all related. What I always tell people when you have a stack of higher goals. The goal is to go like33200:49:18.200 --> 00:49:27.200The Alliance: from those down to your clear goals every day. So you can. You just know this is what's next. Right? So the easiest way. I always tell people to do this is.33300:49:30.610 --> 00:49:56.120The Alliance: you could do it a couple of different ways. But one thing I would I would start with is, i 1 make a list of all the things you would want in yourself to be credible. So like you gotta ask yourself if I was gonna trust Stephanie, with my education on my vet flow education, or whatever what are the credentials, what? What's gonna make me feel like? She she's the one. So that's gonna give you a list of like33400:49:56.240 --> 00:50:06.289The Alliance: 5 or 6 things. She's run a study. She's turned it into a white paper. She's published in a you know, in a journal. She's whatever it is. Had, you know.33500:50:06.950 --> 00:50:14.379The Alliance: Yeah. Done this in positive psychology or neuro, whatever it is, whatever's on your list, start there33600:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.650The Alliance: also put in33700:50:17.270 --> 00:50:38.660The Alliance: everything else that you can see that is visible. You have to build a training, you have to market a training. So what market training is a 1 line. But no, no, that's actually like 11 different things. Right? You have to build a website you have to hire. So take everything. Take everything between here and where you want to go right and just I always say, figure33800:50:38.750 --> 00:50:57.190The Alliance: start with about a hundred things, aim for like a hundred. You'll usually end up with either less like, the path is actually simpler, and you could see it, or more, because you've just gotten all the details. The reason for the detail is is important. One is this is a a higher goal. So it's gonna be difficult.33900:50:57.300 --> 00:51:20.179The Alliance: So you don't want to lose motivation a year from now, when you get to the next step on your list and realize it's actually 10 steps steps. And what you thought was going to take a week is actually 6 months worth of work that's really demotivating. So see all this stuff. Once you see all this stuff, you could also look at it and go. Then the next thing to do is, who am I? What do I like to do? How do I.34000:51:20.180 --> 00:51:20.500Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Have been.34100:51:20.500 --> 00:51:42.379The Alliance: How like all that stuff. So then you sort of got to map it together and ask yourself, okay, is the things that like that I'm not going to do. Do I want to outsource this? Is this something I hire for how do I? You know what I mean? How do I fix this, and you can start, really formulate a plan. And once you get sort of like through the filtering, you just sequence it chronologically, and you.34200:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.050Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Of your next.34300:51:43.050 --> 00:51:45.409The Alliance: You have your your steps all the way forward.34400:51:45.410 --> 00:51:52.009Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, that's good. I need to do that a little bit more structured, because I kind of kind of do it loosely in my head, but I should. I need to read.34500:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.610The Alliance: Well, so I'm gonna.34600:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.410Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: See.34700:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.880The Alliance: On Tuesday, Monday, I guess next week, when we meet on the second.34800:51:58.990 --> 00:52:09.269The Alliance: we're gonna I'm gonna start here with this. I'm gonna give you, so you'll have it recorded. You'll have an entire, the whole framework. I'm gonna lay it out for people.34900:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.730The Alliance: Me.35000:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.510The Alliance: Y'all gotta stop you.35100:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.819The Alliance: I'm trying to save you for yourself. The whole point is, don't spazz out. You couldn't go on a walk.35200:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.280The Alliance: You're on forced bed rest?35300:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.619The Alliance: Oh, so we don't have to pay for another fucking acl.35400:52:27.620 --> 00:52:53.320Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, my God, yeah, exactly. So like, would you? Because one of the things I've kind of been wondering is like whether I should go back and take like some kind of certification or training in neuroscience. Because I I mean, like, I have my biochemistry honors, and I have my vet degree and other than that, it's all just like self learning. I've done a lot of like extra business courses, and like all of that. But would you go back if you were me, and I know it's hard to answer. But like would that be something.35500:52:53.320 --> 00:53:05.310The Alliance: Here's what I would. Here, I'll tell you what I would do. Honestly, this is so. There's you could probably do a neuroscience. Phd.35600:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.990The Alliance: Remotely.35700:53:07.770 --> 00:53:12.899Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, and that's kind of what I was looking at. And I was like, do I need to? And I mean, like like that?35800:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.980Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I don't. I mean I so it it do. You need to.35900:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.750The Alliance: It's a36000:53:16.750 --> 00:53:23.329The Alliance: yeah, I mean it. It depends. It depends on who you want to be in the world. You know what I mean for me, like.36100:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.710Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I'd rather.36200:53:25.040 --> 00:53:35.490The Alliance: I like, I wanted. You know, I'm doing the things with the top nerves. So like, I don't have a degree in neuroscience. Sooner or later, somebody's gonna give me an honorary degree. I figure.36300:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.200Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.36400:53:37.200 --> 00:53:53.400The Alliance: That's what I'm aiming for. But and I really like a couple of years ago, I was like, you know what I think. I'm gonna go get my like, we're gonna take a bunch of these people. I may still take a bunch of my papers and turn them into a Phd. Because I've like I've done more than Phd. You know what I mean.36500:53:53.400 --> 00:54:09.959Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: All my business training and everything like I feel like I've already kind of done a lot of right, because at 1 point I was like, Oh, I should go do my Mba. And like at that time my coach was like, you're living in Mba like you don't need to actually get that on paper like, because you're already doing it. You already know all the stuff. So. But still there's something about the learning.36600:54:09.960 --> 00:54:29.395The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I like, the the question is really about, can you publish in the places you want to publish without it? Right like to me. I wanted to fundamentally influence flow science. That was my goal, right? I didn't really care if I had a Phd. Or not. I like the fact that I punk, rocked my way to the top of this.36700:54:29.690 --> 00:54:53.079Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, well, and that's sometimes how I think, too, because I'm like, okay, like, I know, you know, like, if I do this program and like, if people are liking it, and it's actually changing. And like, we can show that through the metrics, like even already in the program, like, I have my starting, and, you know, kind of finishing assessment. You you would, you know, but it would. So then I'm like, well, then, do I need to like if it's already. But then that's where I get like. Oh, but if I really.36800:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.850The Alliance: I mean the here's the flip side. Here's the question I ask you, which is.36900:54:58.430 --> 00:55:17.580The Alliance: you love learning? You love this topic, and you're wired like me that you like things very official. Right? My question to you is not, should you get a Phd. That might be a waste of time. But should you get a Phd. Where the Phd. Is focused on flow training for vets is prevention for burnout.37000:55:17.940 --> 00:55:40.570The Alliance: and that's your Phd. You know what I mean, especially if you could do that remotely. And that's what you write. And then that's how you do your study. And then that becomes your what like that becomes the foundation of everything going forward. Or you start doing the studies now and fold them into your Ph. You know what I mean like that to me is like, how do you put it all together into a multi tool solution?37100:55:40.775 --> 00:56:06.900Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I think that's probably what I'm doing. Because I want to get this out because I already have my friends being like, yeah, can you talk to us about this? So I'm like, this is what we're doing. So they always ask me right, because I've always kind of been pretty progressive and like leading as far as like how we run our business. And and then so then they're always like, Oh, like, what are you doing for this stuff. And I'm like, well, now, we're doing this. And this is really gonna so anyway, that's kind of like, I'm yeah, like, I'm sure I'll probably roll it out anyway. And so then that's my kind of last question with like rolling it out like.37200:56:07.000 --> 00:56:24.319Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: because I've never been a hundred percent clear, even when we I was doing the high flow coaching, because I just have to. Reference like you flow like like that's all I have to do right like when I'm saying, this is the flow cycle. And I'm talking about it. It's like this comes from the flow research collective. And that's okay, right? Because I don't really want to be stealing anyone's work.37300:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.050The Alliance: No, I mean my no, no, no! My feeling so here. Thank you for asking. That's a great question.37400:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.010Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I always wonder what the.37500:56:29.010 --> 00:56:33.559The Alliance: So, yeah, no. So this is Steve Steven's role. And what? So37600:56:33.770 --> 00:56:58.440The Alliance: this is what's great about. So people thank me for this. People notice, and they thank me for it. And I noticed I thank other people for it. I always give credit, so I never. I always know the author's name. If I read the book, always know who did the paper what their lab is. I try if I'm gonna mention them on stage to know a couple of other things about them.37700:56:58.610 --> 00:57:07.990The Alliance: So if I get asked a question, I can provide some context around that around that thing. So and I go out. I have37800:57:08.140 --> 00:57:08.990The Alliance: now.37900:57:09.400 --> 00:57:16.010The Alliance: for whatever reason, I have a natural memory for it, like I'm really good at it, and you know what I mean.38000:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.530Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No right.38100:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.175The Alliance: I can do. I can do net. But like38200:57:19.860 --> 00:57:42.390The Alliance: it started with. I started to realize that my friends who are neuroscientists when they read papers they didn't skip over the names of the other papers. They actually read the names, and like they started. That's how they learned the names by reading the names of the neuroscience papers getting familiar with them, and then like, Oh, that's interesting. Let me track their work that way. So they built a lattice of knowledge.38300:57:44.030 --> 00:57:59.500The Alliance: But yeah, I like I always appreciate when people give us credit. I get bummed when people don't. I like I I always say, like I don't need. I just want credit for the work I've done like I'm cool. I'm cool everything. But I just like, can I have.38400:57:59.500 --> 00:57:59.930Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Quite a few.38500:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.310The Alliance: The work I've done.38600:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.340Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, yes.38700:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.020The Alliance: I mean, you also have to. You also have to understand like38800:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.099The Alliance: things happened to me that, like38900:58:09.890 --> 00:58:15.264The Alliance: you. So I have a dear friend Jason Silva. You've probably seen him on the interwebs.39000:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.010Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Doesn't.39100:58:16.010 --> 00:58:18.799The Alliance: He was the host of National Geographic's brain games.39200:58:19.410 --> 00:58:19.910The Alliance: And we39300:58:19.910 --> 00:58:36.410The Alliance: we've done shit together on flow and creativity and cannabis and a whole bunch of stuff together for years, and I love Jason, and Jason's a fucking idiot savant when it comes to being able to quote books, but not always remember authors. I've literally been on stage with Jason, where he quotes39400:58:36.570 --> 00:59:01.000The Alliance: 2 pages of one of my books back to me, thinking they're his ideas, and he's literally quoting me verbatim to me on stage, and I don't even know what to do at that point. I'm like, this is so weird. This is like, I don't. What do I say? You've literally said everything I have to say. 1st of all, I got nothing left because you just quoted it all fuck you, but like on top of that, like what39500:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.100The Alliance: this can't have like. It's the weirdest shit that happens.39600:59:05.100 --> 00:59:05.969Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, to say39700:59:05.970 --> 00:59:18.299Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like that, though, and it's like they don't remember that that wasn't their idea. And it's like, I literally just told you that, and then they'll be like we should do this. And I'm like, Oh, my God! I just told you that half an hour ago. It's interesting that happens to me, too, and I don't like it. So yeah, that's no.39800:59:18.890 --> 00:59:22.139The Alliance: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate. And people, the thing is39900:59:22.360 --> 00:59:37.500The Alliance: the people you want to work with are, gonna notice you do it because they want to work with you. You like, I like size of collaborative, but you want to work with people who are like willing to be collab. You know what I mean like, that's really important. And40000:59:37.870 --> 00:59:48.099The Alliance: it's, you know, it's also like I was just thinking about, like Hollywood, and things like that. People don't get it like you've been on a movie set. It's fucking awful.40100:59:48.340 --> 00:59:48.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: You're welcome.40200:59:48.850 --> 00:59:49.460The Alliance: Terrible!40300:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.370The Alliance: It's terrible!40400:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.070The Alliance: Fucking.40500:59:51.070 --> 00:59:53.749Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I took my daughter out of acting because I was like. This is terrible.40600:59:54.056 --> 00:59:56.510The Alliance: No! It's fucking terrible. So like the people.40700:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.860Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Brutal.40800:59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.189The Alliance: The people who survive are the people who can like laugh and40901:00:01.310 --> 01:00:08.002The Alliance: have a good time together, because it's the only fucking way to do it because it's terrible. It's a terrible job nobody should have to do that.41001:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.040Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's really bad.41101:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.465The Alliance: Alright, I am. Gonna41201:00:12.600 --> 01:00:34.590The Alliance: Tell Ryan to hold you accountable for a for a top 100 list of things you have to do and I'm gonna have him hold you accountable for staying on your clear goals list and making sure when you don't get enough sleep at night. You're trying to do the list. But you're tuning down the challenge level. So it meets you where you are.41301:00:35.192 --> 01:00:54.947The Alliance: Those those see? So those seem to be the 3 biggest levers we can pull right now. But I really I have to say, Stephanie, I'm I love how you're thinking about this. I really do. You're thinking? I don't know if I'm right, but to me it's like high integrity. Best way for you know what I mean. So I like that and I pre. I appreciate that.41401:00:55.230 --> 01:01:06.710Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No. And like I wanna say, thank you, too, that I felt like I could just be like, I don't really know how to do this, but, you know, be like, if I ever wanted to work with you, who like, who or what would I have to be? And do you know, because, like, that's the thing.41501:01:06.710 --> 01:01:28.020The Alliance: Yeah, no, I mean, like, you know, I love more people to work work for me. I mean. By the way, I will tell you 1 1 other thing that may help your decision or hurt your decision. But I've said this for years, and so I have wanted a female chief science officer since I started this company since I started this company, and I can't find one.41601:01:28.956 --> 01:01:38.950The Alliance: The reason is, most of the top female neuroscientists who are really top are Asian, and they don't speak English isn't their 1st language.41701:01:39.620 --> 01:02:03.959The Alliance: And they're also all computational neurosciences which isn't really like you have to know how to speak computational neuroscience to do the work today. But it's not English. And it's not close like it doesn't even parade as neuroscience. Right? It's math predominantly, and graph theory and complexity, science and all like it's, you know. I'll be in meetings with the complexity scientists, and we'll be halfway through. And I'll like41801:02:03.960 --> 01:02:16.460The Alliance: text, Michael Minion, I'll be like guys. The fuck is anybody saying right now because you like, I don't speak this language, whatever we're speaking now, like you lost me. This is like, nobody speaks this language. This is not real.41901:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.380The Alliance: So there's a if you do want to become42001:02:20.470 --> 01:02:39.800The Alliance: a neuroscientist, there is a lack of people at the women at the top who are really good spokespeople for the field. They just don't exist. There's a handful. Lisa Feldman Barrett is not bad, but I don't. She's she's wrong, but she's not bad.42101:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.640Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I was, gonna I just listened to one of her podcasts. Is, was it wrong? I was thinking of you.42201:02:43.640 --> 01:02:55.230The Alliance: So. So here's here's the thing you need to know if you wanna so if you want to speak neuroscience, the textbook, I always tell people to read 1st is Yoc concepts, effective neuroscience, which I'm sure you've read. And if you haven't42301:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.880The Alliance: okay, so you don't know who yacht concept is.42401:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.240Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Well, this!42501:03:00.240 --> 01:03:28.890The Alliance: But let me tell you, the yak concept is by affective neuroscience. But coming out of Pavlov behaviorism, emotions are not real right. We couldn't. In the early nineties emotions weren't real. Yacht concept is a neuroscientist. The University of Washington says this is bullshit. Animals have emotions and he starts doing experiments. He starts tickling rats. He finds42601:03:29.070 --> 01:03:47.839The Alliance: he ended up strange since the 7 foundational, emotional, mammalian pathways neuron by neuron through rats. And then blah blah. And so we wrote the foundational textbook on emotions. It's the fund. It's the first, st best neuroscience textbook to start with is affective neuroscience. All right, I gotta. Go. I'm late for my next meeting.42701:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.580Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Thank you.42801:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.120The Alliance: Bye.42901:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.160Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Have the best day. See you later. Bye.
