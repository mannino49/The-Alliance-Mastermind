WEBVTT100:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.640The Alliance: Blair Blair! Steve! Call, are you jumping on?200:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.610The Alliance: Oh, hey! I'm sorry. Bear with me for a second. Let me see if I'm on my outlook here300:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.219The Alliance: absolutely. I'll jump on.400:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.539The Alliance: I see you in the room.500:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.069The Alliance: Okay, sounds good. Thanks.600:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.849Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Hey? My apologies.700:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.970The Alliance: No worries, man. What's up, Captain? How are you.800:06:38.256 --> 00:06:43.990Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I realized that my team wasn't copied on it. So it it ended up in my inbox and not theirs.900:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.400The Alliance: Hmm.1000:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.400Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Works so good from the timing standpoint, though, and we had a little bit of a a zoom that went a little bit long. So.1100:06:51.580 --> 00:07:00.809Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: hey? I got the 1st question I got to ask the old members of the Flow Research Collective. I get messages from them. Is that completely a separate organization? Now.1200:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.540The Alliance: What do you mean?1300:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.370Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So, Rihan, I got a message from.1400:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.046The Alliance: Oh, so yeah.1500:07:10.440 --> 00:07:20.940The Alliance: We split it. Rian Rihanna's doing his own thing. You should. Only you shouldn't be getting messages from Ryan, from the flow research collective. You should only be getting messages from Rian Re endorse.com.1600:07:21.300 --> 00:07:44.649The Alliance: We have sent out so, and I can get it to you again. If you want. We've sent it out, Ryan. We're trying to like we gotta you have to opt out of eat Rian's list, and he's and we've been sending out things that say, Hey, you know we we split. And if you don't want Ryan's email opt out. And if you want me to take your email out out of his emails. I could just give it. Give it to tell Ryan to add you to the list. But yeah, we've1700:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.060The Alliance: the problem is not. Everybody reads every damn email that we send out. So like, we've told people this like.1800:07:50.180 --> 00:08:02.089The Alliance: I don't know how many times, but people keep missing it, and it wasn't the messiest. It wasn't the cleanest way to do that, but because we had to like1900:08:02.630 --> 00:08:21.609The Alliance: basically like the only way we could put it to bed calmly was to give all the partners equal access to the list. 2 of my partners will never use it, but like to appease them. Re and I had to split it, and then we had to do that like. This is the way we have to do it, because there was legal stuff with the other partners. It was.2000:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.709The Alliance: It wasn't clean. Neither of us are exactly thrilled with it. But, like dude.2100:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.260The Alliance: don't ever put a company to bet don't ever try to like.2200:08:30.780 --> 00:08:41.480The Alliance: and then I quietly, no one wants you to get out alive like the whole fucking game is rigged against company like go bankrupt. Easy sell.2300:08:42.650 --> 00:08:52.269The Alliance: just say no, no, we had enough like the the markets change. We just don't want to do this this way anymore. We're done. No, no, no! Fuck you.2400:08:52.816 --> 00:08:55.549Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, no, I get it.2500:08:56.406 --> 00:08:56.939The Alliance: That's good.2600:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.580Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You know, and.2700:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.420The Alliance: They literally like, Go ahead.2800:09:01.420 --> 00:09:09.308Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I was gonna say, consulting with family business owners. That's almost exactly the same thing. Hey? You might want to. Just think of selling this company, you know.2900:09:10.090 --> 00:09:17.530The Alliance: I will the thing, the things that I've learned and I learned the hard way is.3000:09:21.870 --> 00:09:41.919The Alliance: They don't ever teach this to entrepreneurs at. No, I mean, this is my 17th company, or whatever it is like. It's a ridiculous number of companies. Not once along the way has entity ever said to me, Hey, Steven, do you know, it's really hard to like XY. And Z. No idea right? And it's just one of those things I'm like, why3100:09:41.920 --> 00:09:51.920The Alliance: was is this not like part of standard entrepreneurial education along the way? And I realized it's sort of like a gap. And I was looking at it. I was like, this is really interesting. There's opportunity here, because3200:09:52.430 --> 00:09:58.730The Alliance: I can't. You know what I mean? If I if I get punched in the face by this. After 17 companies, everybody is.3300:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.049Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Everybody is. Yeah? Well, it is a huge gap. I think3400:10:02.260 --> 00:10:10.929Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: the gap is closing. There's a few interesting movements in that area, and that's exactly right in the center of where I'm at. So that that includes John Beale, too.3500:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.260Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Same kind of thing.3600:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.540The Alliance: That's it.3700:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.849The Alliance: Are you getting emails from John Beale?3800:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.440Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.3900:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.400The Alliance: Through what the flow research, collective.4000:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.716Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: No, it's4100:10:23.830 --> 00:10:30.330Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: yeah. It does say, flow research collective. It says, free flow. Masterclass is coming up in the flow lab.4200:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.220The Alliance: Okay, yeah on it.4300:10:33.220 --> 00:10:47.489The Alliance: That's actually illegal. He shouldn't be doing that. And I, yeah, I got it. I'll I'll talk. I somebody told me that was going on. I didn't know which coach it was coming from. I love John. He's he's a he's a great guy, but like that's just like4400:10:47.810 --> 00:10:56.826The Alliance: you're that's not legal. And unless you want to pay me cut from your flow lab, or whatever it is that you're doing. That's really uncool.4500:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.000The Alliance: yeah. So.4600:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.609Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Just wanted. That was one of my main questions today. The second question was4700:11:02.880 --> 00:11:12.429Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: back when I did flow for writers and and the flow, coaching, and all that kind of thing. I have access to all that kind of stuff is that access disappearing, or anything like that?4800:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.910The Alliance: So here's what. Here's what's here's what you have and what you don't have. And just so this is.4900:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.429The Alliance: we're communicating this slowly, because it's it. There's all kinds of craziness so5000:11:25.710 --> 00:11:33.450The Alliance: low for writers like the actual class you will have that will remain on mighty networks forever. Right? So that's gonna be it5100:11:33.480 --> 00:11:55.380The Alliance: forever. If there's a there's a weird. So you may, I would. What's gonna happen is in December or January. You're gonna have to sign a waiver to get access re access it again, basically because we are shutting the company down. But we want to allow everybody to continue to have access. But if the training goes wrong for people, we cannot be liable5200:11:55.380 --> 00:12:23.490The Alliance: right? So that's the liability. It's a business insurance issue. So we're gonna access will not change at all till December, and in January, or whatever the only little changes, I think we're gonna standardize it and put like, because there's a ton of different versions up of every class, and we don't need it. We can just get the like this. We'll standardize it with with the best one quality wise that we think is there and what is? Gonna go away completely?5300:12:23.774 --> 00:12:28.900The Alliance: But it's gonna be replaced with something cool is your access to your one on one coaching calls.5400:12:29.493 --> 00:12:37.929The Alliance: That those are stored on zoom and the problem is, if zoom gets hacked5500:12:38.200 --> 00:12:59.159The Alliance: one, we have to continue to maintain the accounts which a little bit of expense, but if Zoom gets hacked we're liable. So if Zoom gets hacked, which it's going to get hacked at some fucking point. I don't believe Zoom's improved right, and your data gets downloaded you. These coaching calls, which are private, we can be liable, and that is too much.5600:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.620Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yes.5700:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.749The Alliance: Data security liability is actually like.5800:13:03.110 --> 00:13:14.505The Alliance: I can the business insurance to like the coaching stuff like whatever is a hundred dollars a month. I got no problem carrying it. But the liability insurance is actually really steep, and I don't want to carry it. And5900:13:14.790 --> 00:13:34.620The Alliance: the true and legal. The truth of the matter is, access is lifetime of company. So all of this is above and beyond anything we are supposed to do legally, because the company is gone. We're no longer paying tax all gone. So this is just like us being trying to be as cool as possible our customers, because we love our customers. But like it's we're also like.6000:13:34.620 --> 00:13:40.530The Alliance: we also have mentally unstable customers who slip through. You know what I mean like. And I and we've seen it.6100:13:40.530 --> 00:14:10.139The Alliance: You know what I mean. I've also seen like the shittiest thing is the refund request that people like where I see their scams where I'm like, and you know we get them turned down, and whatever but I'm like this is really crappy, like you. I can. I've got all your coaching calls. I can see all your work. I you took the course you went through. All of you got actually great results, and we have a nice exit interview, and you're on a payment plan, and the company's going away. So you think you could fight this easily, and that's just shitty. You're just.6200:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.850Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, no, I get it.6300:14:12.180 --> 00:14:35.940The Alliance: That's it. So those are yeah, that like, we haven't publicized any of that stuff. Because we at this point, we don't. It's really like walking a type rope like the legal stuff is really bizarre, I've discovered, and really complicated. And we can't even get. We can't get tail insure. If we could get tail insurance we have. We have to just keep getting regular business insurance. And you know.6400:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.920Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, doesn't.6500:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.630Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: No, I.6600:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.840The Alliance: You know, makes sense. So then from that standpoint, if I wanna grab that stuff, I just gotta make sure that I get that off.6700:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.470Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: And onto my system. Kind of thing.6800:14:47.470 --> 00:14:59.720The Alliance: Well, you. The only thing you have to grab is your coach at one on one coaching calls. Everything else you'll is is still gonna be there, and with the one on one coaching calls what we're gonna do instead, which I think everybody's gonna be totally fine with what people don't realize is that6900:14:59.840 --> 00:15:19.659The Alliance: most of those calls are the same questions over and over and over with people. Right? Everybody's got roughly the same kinds of questions. So we're doing a AI analysis of all the coaching calls for each of the classes. And we're and we're gonna do a QA. Like, a. Frequently asked questions that either I'm gonna do or be a book that we include. So like the fact7000:15:20.110 --> 00:15:44.940The Alliance: if you shut that down for legal reasons. But we're actually gonna duplicate the material and give people access to it when we do in in a form. QA. So there may be the odd question out that like doesn't get covered. But as a general rule, you can batch these things because almost 90% of people come to the same. You know, it's well built that way. So you know, that's always to me. The sign of a good training is when the same people have the same questions at the same time.7100:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.059Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Great. You know what I mean?7200:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.940Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And then, the flow coaching7300:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.649Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: that material same kind of thing as as the flow for writers.7400:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.869The Alliance: Yeah. So that the only the only difference with that one is that lives on school. And and that's gonna just stay on school.7500:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.710Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay.7600:16:03.010 --> 00:16:18.380The Alliance: So yeah, every any program, the all the flow coaching stuff, the the most recent stuff. Once everybody got the people got moved to school for that. That's staying on school because we're not gonna ask you to jump platforms to access that material. So it'll stay where it was.7700:16:18.380 --> 00:16:18.790Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Some checks.7800:16:19.337 --> 00:16:23.720The Alliance: The truth of the matter is like, honestly.7900:16:24.340 --> 00:16:30.911The Alliance: I think I'm gonna keep access open for a couple of years, maybe 2 or 3, and then it's gonna go away.8000:16:32.460 --> 00:16:40.825The Alliance: mostly for liability reasons, like it's just a little. It's too spooky. It's really like and8100:16:41.840 --> 00:17:06.159The Alliance: I feel like there's so we generate so much free content for people all the time that I just feel like, you know, I feel like I did my job in a sense, and like that, that, like fair is fair, is fair, and you know I feel like I've gone above and beyond what most companies would do. And my friends are like. Don't do that, you know. Shut it down, you know, like no, no, I like our customers. I want to find a way to do this right? So that's what we're doing.8200:17:06.810 --> 00:17:18.006Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, there's a i mean, there's a lot of when I went through that there's so much good material. And and you know, presentations and that kind of thing that you just want to reference them every once in a while, just as a refresher. But8300:17:18.250 --> 00:17:28.079The Alliance: Yeah, we we're not. Gonna we're not. I don't think we're gonna pull those things down. And if we do pull stuff down, what we may do is like, send you your like. If somebody8400:17:28.569 --> 00:17:36.499The Alliance: once it will send a copy to you. Kind of thing, we're again one of the problem, one of the issues8500:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.403The Alliance: is and I don't know how I feel about this is8600:17:42.060 --> 00:18:02.089The Alliance: people are taking that content and reskinning it and selling it as their stuff, and that like, if that's my problem, is not my customers who want it for the reason they they wanted it cool. My customers who want it because they're actually going to take my stuff8700:18:02.360 --> 00:18:12.030The Alliance: and resell it. I I don't entirely feel motivated to help people do that. You know what I mean especially if I don't know them.8800:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.941Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, yeah, I know a hundred percent. And and I mean that that kind of shit's always gonna happen. But8900:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.160Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: yeah, I think.9000:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.180The Alliance: A certain level of it, like there was when we were giant.9100:18:23.540 --> 00:18:47.299The Alliance: and it was sort of like we were so big that you couldn't touch us. It didn't matter to me. I was that like I, I could choose to work one way with it. But now I'm just a little like, because even Ryan, like he owns a bunch of that material. And I like, you know what I mean. So there's even separate IP inside of there. And at this point I'm just like, I don't know exactly what we're doing next. So I'm a little. I'm trying to be a little cautious until I know.9200:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.717Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, that's incredibly hard to unwind.9300:18:51.110 --> 00:19:03.258The Alliance: It's a it's a it's a tricky one, and it's a tricky one, because, like my personal interests, are at odds with the mission, with certain portions of the mission like things like that. It it and it's weird.9400:19:03.730 --> 00:19:09.589The Alliance: but it's fine. Made a lot of money. Made a lot of fun. Worked really. Well.9500:19:09.590 --> 00:19:16.259Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That was good programs. I I mean, I found this program like going through all of that.9600:19:17.110 --> 00:19:32.300Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I felt like I hit the ground running like I've got my protocols and all that kind of thing in place, and that we talked to Early on about Vipassana and that kind of thing. So I'm actually like struggling to come up, you know, with this call. Wanted to ask some some really good questions. That that was one. Because I'm like, I gotta9700:19:32.510 --> 00:19:42.577Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you. You know what your calendars like. It's just stacked. And you're thinking, Okay, this material is there now, and if it disappears, you know, I wanna capture it so that I can refer back to it.9800:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.409The Alliance: Yeah, no course. Wise. We're just. I mean, literally like9900:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.840The Alliance: every single document is being transferred. I like, I'm watching it have. It's months worth of work10000:19:53.950 --> 00:19:59.230The Alliance: to get it. It's like one person is literally just. That's all she's been doing for 4 months now.10100:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.790The Alliance: Every day.10200:20:02.517 --> 00:20:24.340Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Couple of questions. So I I'm I'm right. In the middle of this Mtp. Which was perfect. I mean nothing else that call that we had where you gave me the distinction that an Mtp. Like I was always, I was thinking, on this massive level, but an Mtp. Like you said could be 6 to 8 years, and then maybe there's a new Mtp. Kind of thing. So I've I've literally over the past.10300:20:24.340 --> 00:20:31.910The Alliance: By the way, I have to tell you, it's people hate that bit of advice, but it's like I love that you've I love that you got it, because the thing that you'll figure out10400:20:32.170 --> 00:21:01.210The Alliance: is, once you'll cure your Mtp. In, you know, 6 to 8 years, and you'll get there, and you'll be a different person than you are now. And you're right. Like purpose is a is a like, the way the brain literally does. Purpose is, it's an attractor network built up over time, right? And it's you know, it's it operates as a bunch of different levels of the hierarchy. But it's nothing about it literally is static. It's not static in the brain. So people are like, this is my purpose. And I'm like.10500:21:01.370 --> 00:21:11.587The Alliance: okay. But like your neurobiology doesn't act like literally. It's it's designed for purpose to be like a far reaching goal that you move towards. Right?10600:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.929The Alliance: so I think you like, I like what you're doing with that that makes a lot of sense. I think that's great.10700:21:18.250 --> 00:21:33.769Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Well, and that's you know, it's similar. I wonder if there's maybe you know the studies on that? Is it like that? 6 to 8 year thing because you talk about that in relationships where you kind of got to fall in love with your spouse again every 6 to 8 years, because they're a completely different person, right? And if you're not.10800:21:33.980 --> 00:21:39.874Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: if you're not working on that, you know, like people like, well, they've changed. Of course they've changed. I mean, that's just how things are.10900:21:40.570 --> 00:21:48.039Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: But on that note, yeah. So dove into that. The last, probably 6 weeks have just been11000:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.029Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: pedal to the metal that kind of thing. So I we've got a new consulting firm that we've hired on11100:21:54.700 --> 00:22:07.029Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: so, ceg worldwide, they specialize in financial advisors. I've hired a company called Blue Ripple to do like the my.11200:22:07.150 --> 00:22:15.939Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: all my promotions and all that kind of thing, change the format of the business change the staff, move my son into financial advisor role. That kind of thing.11300:22:16.315 --> 00:22:42.549Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Got 2 or 3 key referral centers that are all they're gonna take the sepa course. Which. That was a big turnout that was really cool, because, you know, another guy in the community said, Let's do this together so built that team. So my calendar stacked. I feel good about all of that. There was something that jumped out in one of your notes. And I, I just I read it. And I thought, Okay, I gotta. I gotta ask Stephen this question. You had mentioned one time11400:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.369Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: that you always start your next book before you finish your last.11500:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.380The Alliance: Fuck, yeah.11600:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.619Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: And I I wrote that down, and I I need to.11700:22:51.620 --> 00:23:20.620The Alliance: So important man so single, best. But, by the way, book is stand in for any big, consuming, creative, emotionally involved high flow project, right. Anything that has been meeting those identity needs giving me confidence, calming me down because it's been dropping me into any of those any anything like that. I always want my next project first, st because 2 things, this. So11800:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.320The Alliance: one. Here's what I want to guard against.11900:23:24.570 --> 00:23:35.020The Alliance: There are like. There's writers who you meet them on book tour, or speeches, or whatever, and they've like. They got one book they wrote 5 years ago, and they're still pimping the same.12000:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.630Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.12100:23:36.630 --> 00:23:52.339The Alliance: They're not writers, they're something else. And writing was a marketing vehicle for them, and that's fine. They don't need that. But if you're an actual writer like you're getting fulfillment out of the writing thing. The minute12200:23:53.070 --> 00:24:07.779The Alliance: you don't start the project before the this one is out the door. All your eggs go in that basket, and you start like here's the difference, Blair. I'll give you the exact difference. You'll get this. So the difference between waking up and starting a writing project.12300:24:08.318 --> 00:24:14.169The Alliance: And having a book out, or you know, care what or versus not is.12400:24:15.370 --> 00:24:26.400The Alliance: If I have a book, if I'm writing a project. I will check my Amazon ranking maybe once a day. If I'm not, all my eggs are in that basket, I will literally check my Amazon, ranking every 10Êmin12500:24:26.400 --> 00:24:49.909The Alliance: to see how he's doing right. And I'm like, you know what I mean. It doesn't matter how much restraint I haven't like. That's what I find. My brain starts to do. It starts to care too much. And then things that I shouldn't care about like, oh, you got bumped from this podcast because blah blah, they can't be on Nbc because Israel went to war with so and so that shit happens all the time, right? And if all my eggs are in the12600:24:50.200 --> 00:25:11.139The Alliance: basket about the thing that's about to happen in the world that I'm caring about. Those are big problems. But if I'm already caring about the of the thing that's next. Those problems are more in perspective. And I'm like, Oh, no, I'm playing the long game that shitty that happened. But we'll, you know I don't want to care too much, because it's how I protect my emotions that makes sense12700:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.920The Alliance: totally makes sense. So it's it's kind of that momentum thing that because you've got.12800:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.650Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah. And the other, okay, yeah.12900:25:17.650 --> 00:25:28.549The Alliance: The other thing is is functional fixedness. So I find that if you wait for the project to be done, and then you try to start something next, especially that project did. Well.13000:25:28.760 --> 00:25:58.079The Alliance: you like it too much. You write that way. You want to do the same kind, and maybe the product doesn't need. That doesn't require that. You know what I mean. Like, I had a real problem after nar country, because I couldn't fucking. Stop writing like that, and like that tote of voice is useful for nothing. But in our country like really like, it's not helpful, right? And so that was that, you know I'm trying to guard against all those things. Does that make sense that helpful.13100:25:58.400 --> 00:26:07.980Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, it does. It's helpful. Because I I think sometimes I you know, if there's that concern on the other side of oh, am I am I taking on way too much? But I guess that's just a process of13200:26:08.500 --> 00:26:16.500Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: checking myself, and I like I don't. I don't burn out like, you know I'm going from window to window to window. That kind of thing.13300:26:16.901 --> 00:26:21.430Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: And then all of the the micro flows, and that kind of thing are really helpful, like I.13400:26:21.430 --> 00:26:38.929The Alliance: Here's this Blair, let me tell you. Let me let me. Here's my here's my caution, or my only like, think about this cause. This has been my experience over and over and over again. And, by the way, I don't necessarily know if I got a fix here. Okay, I'm just telling you this is this is more of a warning like this is.13500:26:39.210 --> 00:26:48.579The Alliance: I'm very much like you. I don't think there's the work life balance is for people who hate what they do like. If you love what you fucking do, there's like work like there is that doesn't exist13600:26:48.680 --> 00:26:59.979The Alliance: like you know what I mean, like, I'm working all the time, unless I'm like actively recovering or chilling with my wife like those like. Those are the options right? Like.13700:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.420Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Exactly.13800:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.750The Alliance: Pretty much, I mean, like I might get in an hour of football news a day.13900:27:06.100 --> 00:27:25.820The Alliance: You know what I mean like if I can really like. Oh, my God! It's a fucking luxury. I'm going to get like 40Êmin of like football news, or watch some skating or something like that that's literally like entertainment around my house for me. But what I've noticed is like everything can be locked and loaded. I've got my meditation. I've got my sauna, I've got high flow activity, everything's working14000:27:25.920 --> 00:27:34.179The Alliance: and shit starts going wrong. And the problem is, when my schedule's so tight and stuff starts breaking.14100:27:34.350 --> 00:28:00.679The Alliance: I don't. Actually, that's where you get fucked up, because then you don't. Then you don't have the. You're you're not anti-fragile because it's packed too tight to be anti-fragile, and that's that actually like literally happened to me this month. My, you know, like my father out of nowhere got had a knee replacement, and it didn't go well, and he was. He's been in the hospital for a month, and14200:28:00.680 --> 00:28:22.589The Alliance: so, like the brothers are on high, alert. And and you know all this stuff and a couple like couple of house things the thing I told you about like right, it was just like, and I and I got rocked out of my game by it like rocked out of my game. And I was like, and I realized it wasn't that like it wasn't. I was totally dialed, but I was like, Oh, you did it again! You don't have.14300:28:22.590 --> 00:28:50.260The Alliance: You didn't have enough space in your calendar to absorb the like shit that like landed on you. And I basically like lost a couple of days to crisis management out of like stuff in the world. And I'm like, I'm just now starting to come back. You know what I mean. But like, I've literally been sleeping in my office basically for like 5 days, because I'm literally like I was up today. I was up at 2 o'clock, 2 3, rd 2 thirds of my desk at 2 30 this morning.14400:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.620Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You're right, though. I mean the the challenge is, how do you? You know what's the solution? How do you solve that? But.14500:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.845The Alliance: I think this, I think this, I think this solution is14600:29:03.310 --> 00:29:20.619The Alliance: to just like I would like, instead of always going to scheduling my days to 10. I'm gonna schedule them to 9 and a half or 9. I'm just gonna build a little extra. I'm gonna try to build a tiny little in this. The way I'm thinking about it. Blair is in the same way that, like14700:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.619The Alliance: I found it's good to have an extra checking account for like home repair shit and medical shit.14800:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.779Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, yeah.14900:29:26.780 --> 00:29:47.210The Alliance: Like, just have the account. This is sort of the time version of that in my mind. That's how I've been thinking about it. I don't know how to operationalize it. I don't know exactly what it looks like, but I've been thinking about it a lot, which is what I'm telling you, because that's I look at you. And I'm like smooth engine. This is really working. But how much15000:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.580The Alliance: right? Like what happens when shit starts to wobble? That's the question I ask.15100:29:52.580 --> 00:30:05.270Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, no, that's a good point. And you know there's a i don't know what the psychology behind it is. But like, I just ordered my next 20 books. And they're stacked up, and that kind of thing, and that doesn't overwhelm me. That excites me. I look at them.15200:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.879The Alliance: Yeah, dude, I did. I did. By the way, I just did the same thing.15300:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.229The Alliance: Yeah. Well, cause I ordered a big stack at the front of the summer, and I'm sort of like15400:30:13.380 --> 00:30:23.530The Alliance: 2 thirds of it through. And I was like, Okay, like, you know, I got. And I know I have a lot of travel coming so like long plane flights. And I was like, I gotta re up the stack.15500:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.599Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, totally last question. I know we're we're right on time here.15600:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.349The Alliance: No, we're fine, like I like we. You got started late. So let's like, unless hold on, let me.15700:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.409Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, you should check.15800:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.540The Alliance: Yeah, I'm totally fine. I that's what I thought.15900:30:38.380 --> 00:30:52.510Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So interesting thing happened last night. So my son came to me. He's the one that's is going to be an advisor at the end of the year. That kind of thing absolutely fantastic kid, like Super organized that kind of thing reads like voraciously.16000:30:52.650 --> 00:31:05.859Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and I didn't even know this, and I talked to him a little bit about this and what we're doing, and and those kind of things just dropping little quick chats. And he said to me, hey, can I show you something? And I said, Yeah, he said, I started drawing.16100:31:06.180 --> 00:31:23.719Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I said, Okay, so started to do some drawings. He started showing the drawings. He writes voraciously, like he's writing every day. And then he was talking. So I bought him just in preparation for this next role. I bought him grit by Duckworth.16200:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.300Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and he had a question about it. He said, well, she kind of talks about16300:31:28.640 --> 00:31:40.899Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: having one thing and focusing on the one thing he goes. Now I'm struggling with that because I was just moving in a pattern where I'm I'm adding all these different artistic endeavors and that kind of thing, so that led me to a question which I couldn't answer.16400:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.500Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, show you.16500:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.860The Alliance: Let me let me solve this for you before we get to the question.16600:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.390Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.16700:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.780The Alliance: So16800:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.510The Alliance: I like Angela a lot.16900:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.040Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.17000:31:54.040 --> 00:32:06.360The Alliance: Angela wrote her book and did her thinking. Pretty much building off of Anders Erickson's 10,000Êh concept right that there's an undercurrent of that there.17100:32:06.510 --> 00:32:10.410The Alliance: So there have been 2 major challenges.17200:32:10.480 --> 00:32:38.500The Alliance: 3 major challenges to Anders work, one mounted by him. Him, he said, wait a minute. This is really good for mathematicians and violinists and a couple other fields. I'm not sure if it's everybody right. And then I came along and said, Hey, wait a minute flow shortcuts the path to mastery, and he agreed, like I knew Anders before he passed, he agreed. And then the great one, and what you have to you have to read is my friend David Epstein's challenge, which was range?17300:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.820The Alliance: Oh, yeah, okay. Have you read it?17400:32:42.270 --> 00:32:42.720The Alliance: Yeah.17500:32:42.970 --> 00:32:54.999The Alliance: Okay, so range is the answer to your son's question, because your son is totally right. So it's the thing is, the normal path to greatness is.17600:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.410The Alliance: I test a ton of shit.17700:32:57.950 --> 00:33:19.209The Alliance: and I figure out what I like, which is exactly what I do in the passion recipe. That's how the passion recipe is built, David and I. He did his research completely, independently of me, and we were following different lines of research. But we ended up right at the exact same spot, which is that if you were at the front end of like, I'm just trying to figure out like17800:33:19.240 --> 00:33:30.299The Alliance: all this feels really good. I want to see, where do I have skill. Where do these puzzles go like the scale? There's nothing wrong with that approach. That's how most people, myself included.17900:33:30.300 --> 00:33:55.709The Alliance: right? Test out a million things hone in on a handful. Go wide. Come back, go wide! Come back, you know. And this is why this is exactly exactly Blair where we started. This is why purpose evolves the same reason why purpose evolves right. And it's also like all that gold, the creative, pathfinding architecture. We went through the second class.18000:33:55.890 --> 00:34:11.560The Alliance: All of that is essentially built atop this cognitive framework. Because I my experience is with deliberate practice, is so what he, what Anders, and what nobody bothered to like point out after that is.18100:34:12.130 --> 00:34:41.769The Alliance: I know mathematicians. I know musicians, I know, like violin, like I know the people. He like the deliberate patches. People are a personality type. They're not. And they're. And, by the way, those are very linked like, if you're good at math, you're probably good at music. Those are things in the brain, right? If you're good at drawing, and you're good at writing, you're probably going to have bigger challenges in those 10,000Êh areas. It's only in really tight domains. And what our work revealed is that18200:34:41.940 --> 00:34:54.400The Alliance: deliberate play outperforms, deliberate practice almost under every condition. Deliberate. Pray, is what I have you guys doing? It's improv. It's it's repetition with improvisation. Right?18300:34:55.139 --> 00:35:07.260The Alliance: there are times when you absolutely want to go deliberate practice on it. And I'll give you an example. This summer. I am doing the most psychotically sports specific ski training18400:35:07.300 --> 00:35:18.670The Alliance: ever like where I'm specific. I'm running all kinds of deceleration, eccentric exercises, and that's like 90% of what I'm doing in in the gym. I've never18500:35:18.680 --> 00:35:38.899The Alliance: done that. But I have been doing this long enough and broken enough things that I was like. This is the weak spot in my game. This is where I keep running into problems. And if I'm gonna I'm gonna train it out. And it's gonna take right? So like, that's a deliberate practice. Right? I'm very specifically. And everything's deliberate practice in there as what I'm doing. There's no, you know18600:35:39.290 --> 00:35:47.659The Alliance: so like there are those times there. Those times are great, but, as a general rule, anyways, take a look at range. You'll fucking love it and love that book. Yeah, really.18700:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.420Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay, awesome. I've got it at home, so I'll let him read it first.st18800:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.589Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: that's really cool. And that was who was the other guy Anders.18900:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.309The Alliance: Ericsson, Anders Erickson is he was the god. So the.19000:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.470Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, yeah. Yeah.19100:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.380The Alliance: It. So the where is it? It's19200:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.069The Alliance: the fuck, is it? Turn in front of me?19300:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.830The Alliance: No?19400:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.900The Alliance: This is the Bible.19500:36:17.530 --> 00:36:31.140The Alliance: the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and expert Performance, edited by K. Anders Erickson. Among other things, I will tell you a funny story about him. He was at the University of Florida or Miami forever. He just died.19600:36:32.880 --> 00:36:39.479The Alliance: So I met him for the very 1st time at the Santa Fe Institute Performance Conference they used to have. That was very fancy and very19700:36:39.970 --> 00:37:01.440The Alliance: heavy, and I had never met him. But I had mounted this big challenge to his work in rise of super bad, and like we're both at the conference, and I'm going to the bathroom. I literally walk into the toilet, and I saw I know he's behind me in line like 4 or 5 people, and I and I walk in. I'm looking at the urinal. And suddenly I hear. So19800:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.909The Alliance: you don't like my work, do you?19900:37:04.371 --> 00:37:07.138Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Pulls it out in the can.20000:37:07.600 --> 00:37:16.660The Alliance: While we're in the can. I just started laughing so hard it was like, Oh, my God, this is the funniest! But I was like captive audience. Fuck20100:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.030The Alliance: you.20200:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.840Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I got nowhere to go.20300:37:20.980 --> 00:37:38.680The Alliance: I was laughing really hard. I was like he was a funny. He was a nice guy. I liked him, but that was the Bible forever. He! He did all the he did all the work, and it's still a great book. His work is. Nothing in his work is exactly20400:37:39.010 --> 00:37:59.370The Alliance: wrong, but it doesn't account for flow, and it doesn't account for neural dynamics right like. And he was looking very. He was looking at domains that you? It's easier to do research in people. Forget that. How hard it is to do good research, and how like science wants to give me the most tightly controlled thing I can possibly find.20500:37:59.520 --> 00:38:12.620The Alliance: and that's how we get good data. But it doesn't. And he always said that he was like, you know, when Malcolm Gladwell wrote, whatever his book on expertise was, the 1st person was like. No, no, it's not 10,000Êh, Malcolm. You made that up, was Anders.20600:38:12.770 --> 00:38:13.090Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.20700:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.329The Alliance: Right, which I always loved about him, but20800:38:17.490 --> 00:38:31.530The Alliance: so you could check that book out. It's it's got it, but it's a big, by the way, that I should tell you if you don't know this. The Cambridge Handbook Series, in my opinion, is20900:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.100The Alliance: so21000:38:35.640 --> 00:38:53.179The Alliance: you get to a point in reading these sort of pop the Pop side books at that level that you're like, I fucking know all this stuff I've read all like they're just repeating each other. David Epstein's range is good because he's a deep journalist, and it's new information. But it's general. You get to a certain point where you just like, I know all this. What's the next level down.21100:38:53.180 --> 00:38:53.520Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.21200:38:53.520 --> 00:39:16.679The Alliance: I love the Cambridge Handbook series because they go around the world. They'll pick a topic. They'll go around the world, find the best papers from, like, basically the best researchers around the world, and give you like a global perspective from almost every field that touches. So like the Cambridge handbook on imagination is everything, from like narrative, storytelling traditions, to like the narrow science of imagination, to like.21300:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.030The Alliance: You know.21400:39:17.030 --> 00:39:30.359The Alliance: Sufi, mysticism and store it right, like all of. It's in there, and I just find them there. And they're huge. They're like 800 pages. So if I'm like going to Europe or like, I just one of those always comes with me because I just they're always great.21500:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.779Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, that's a good, a good idea. I remember you talking about that before. I think it was in Flow for writers. Is that21600:39:35.990 --> 00:39:48.237Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you grab the books that are in the airport, you know you can read those. That's your 1st level and then go down to their references. Then you're reading. Now you get down to that 3rd 4th Level.21700:39:48.820 --> 00:40:11.430The Alliance: Well, it's where I mean, if you're trying to do so, if you're not trying to steal somebody's work, and you're trying to build on somebody's research right? And and add to it with like, this is the stuff I learned stuff I learned from them. And like, let's take it farther. You have to get that level of understanding, because otherwise all you're doing is just like ripping off the people who made it digestible.21800:40:11.840 --> 00:40:20.259The Alliance: To me. That's what's not cool. I don't care who, if you're taking the stuff and taking it farther and building.21900:40:20.610 --> 00:40:26.280The Alliance: that's the whole point. That's the whole point of having a field and a bunch of people doing this and like that's awesome.22000:40:26.280 --> 00:40:50.979The Alliance: And you know, just share your information if you can, somewhere. You know what I mean like, then you're contributing. And so I always want to try to contribute, and you can't. If you don't read at that level you're not contributing like that's 1 of the things I loved about David Epstein, and I love about David. He's a he's a great journalist first, st and so he's in the sports gene. In these are foundational texts22100:40:51.320 --> 00:41:04.789The Alliance: in peak performance. Like he did the work he wrote Scott like fun to read scholarly work, that is, that you can train from using classes. And that's fantastic. I'm totally like, when people did that, I'm like.22200:41:06.030 --> 00:41:15.950The Alliance: fuck. Yeah, this is awesome. Thank you so much. Especially with David, because I can point people that like if he didn't write range, I was gonna have to. I'm so glad he did, because I22300:41:16.470 --> 00:41:27.299The Alliance: alright can I ask you 2 questions, because you've got a little perspective on this one just out of curiosity. Did you like the presentation the last class22400:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.590The Alliance: earlier this week on Monday?22500:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.380Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Got a lot of it. So let me just reorient.22600:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.359The Alliance: It was. It was on high speed. Teams.22700:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.580Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: The teams thing.22800:41:36.190 --> 00:41:43.129Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, I took a lot of notes. I think it's like anything else. I mean, inside of that time period.22900:41:44.800 --> 00:41:56.180Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: The the only thing that misses for me is I need that further note or reference, like an email that followed up saying, If hey, if you want to take any of these subjects deeper.23000:41:56.658 --> 00:42:04.410Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That kind of thing, as you can see. I'm a reader kind of thing, but I what I got from it, and that's exactly where I'm at right now. Because I I have.23100:42:04.620 --> 00:42:26.350The Alliance: Larry. That's an awesome suggest. I'm not gonna do. I can't. I don't have time to do it in front of you, but that's like a follow up, so that well, the other thing is like, I don't. We recorded it. So we've got the fathom notes from the thing also, which could be provided. This. So that's that's fairly easy. But that's a follow up. Follow up. Reading would be a really cool thing.23200:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.889Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, it's just that. If you want to double, click on it.23300:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.470The Alliance: Yes.23400:42:29.470 --> 00:42:50.719Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Because that's when I get a chance to speak to you. I want to know. What are you reading? What do you like, you know. But I mean that that's pretty specific feedback, because I'm a reader like I'm going to take that subject. I make copious notes on things, and there was a bunch of things that jumped out at me because I got 4 or 5 teams, and I'm now trying to to figure out.23500:42:50.720 --> 00:43:03.939The Alliance: Blair, I gotta tell you, popped up on my calendar this morning. I looked at, I smiled, and I was like, you know, Blair is sort of my ideal client I've come to realize, like, if in terms of well, but also in terms of like.23600:43:04.130 --> 00:43:10.039The Alliance: it feels like you're extracting maximum benefit. I could be wrong like, but like23700:43:10.590 --> 00:43:24.159The Alliance: I see the questions you're asking. You know what I mean. Like, I have a lot of these conversations. I'm like, oh, it did like this is I? You know what I mean, which is funny, by the way, because if you would have lined up everybody and told you their jobs ahead of time and like, who's gonna work like.23800:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.500Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.23900:43:24.500 --> 00:43:30.090The Alliance: I would like I would. You know, when we talked about it, I was like, we don't know. We don't know how this is gonna work for you. Right?24000:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.690Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Boring the boring financial budget.24100:43:32.125 --> 00:43:34.734The Alliance: I mean, as it turns up.24200:43:35.560 --> 00:44:02.889The Alliance: it's 1 of the. It's funny because we're gonna do these. We're gonna start doing these CEO weekends starting next year. And one of the reasons that I'm gaining confidence in them is like working with guys. Couple a couple of the the more business people in the alliance I'm like, oh, no, this is this, content is deadly for that like they were like which dialed for them. How are you liking the alliance because you've taken a lot of trains. How are you finding the alliance in comparison.24300:44:04.401 --> 00:44:30.459Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So again. It's specific feedback I've been through, you know, the other flow things right? So I felt like I hit the ground running. But I mean I've always had this mindset that if hey, if I just hear something again, and this time I apply it. That's good enough, like. I'm not looking at it, saying like that one distinction could be the thing that I need. So it is in my mind. I'm not referencing. Value that way.24400:44:32.490 --> 00:44:48.190Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: The look back is important to me, because, as you can probably tell, I haven't been able to put my drawings in or anything like that I'm just. I'm going full out all day kind of thing. So, and at the end of the day I hit like 9, 10 o'clock, and I'm like. All right now, I need to meditate.24500:44:48.480 --> 00:45:03.190Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Now I need to have a sauna. I need to take the dog for a walk, that kind of thing, and then my next day begins, and that kind of thing. So that's the only thing that I've struggled with is feeling like I'm not participating enough. But am I extracting value out of it24600:45:03.410 --> 00:45:10.809Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: when we went back to the beginning? And I don't know if this is curriculum driven this feedback, or it's just24700:45:11.290 --> 00:45:30.770Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: when we started talking about, you know, starting to put together what you're really good at. And that was it just came up in this conversation. One thing that I realized through that work is, I don't dabble in anything like I've presented systems to people. And what bugs me is like, oh, yeah, well, I like that. And I like that. And I'm like, no, it's a system. Apply the whole system.24800:45:31.220 --> 00:46:00.490Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: then figure out, and what I've been able to do is put 2 or 3 different systems together, especially when you talk about being where your feet are like a lot of people talk about mindfulness and that kind of. Well, there's precursors to mindfulness. Your calendar is all fucked up. You can't be mindful, because when you're at home you're thinking about work when you're at work, but that going through that work again about the Mtp. And and all that kind of thing. What I really liked about this24900:46:00.560 --> 00:46:06.309Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: in particular. So this is the positive feedback here on this is that these conversations?25000:46:06.450 --> 00:46:13.460Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Because if I'm sitting in a classroom and I'm doing those kind of things, being able to just have a conversation with you and with25100:46:14.103 --> 00:46:25.259Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: people that are on the calls, and that kind of thing that's helpful, because I don't know why it just crystallizes some of the things that I just can't get out of the the class does that I don't know. That didn't sound like.25200:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.849The Alliance: No, I mean, like you're not like what? What?25300:46:34.175 --> 00:46:47.099The Alliance: It does help a lot. It's i i you know I'm trying to solve one like one I'm asking questions about like the format of the Alliance. So we're gonna do another 4 month one. And we actually sort of25400:46:47.540 --> 00:47:06.329The Alliance: changed the front end a little bit. So it's a different sort of a slightly different group of people. To see that. And I'll and I'll make a couple of changes off this 1st curriculum. But I'm also like, I'm wondering, should this be a 3 month training instead of a 4 month. Training is 4 month to spread out for people, because I've noticed that.25500:47:06.330 --> 00:47:06.980Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Excellent.25600:47:07.170 --> 00:47:19.140The Alliance: The. But you lose some of the urgency with people like that's what you that's what seems to go away. So I don't know there's lots of those questions, but I like I just wanna make25700:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.970The Alliance: I.25800:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.370Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Boy, I.25900:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.809The Alliance: My. My impression of the alliance is.26000:47:24.460 --> 00:47:53.400The Alliance: everybody's actually getting a great deal out of it. And I'm like being meeting with people I'm really liking what's going on. But I like, I want to make sure I'm not biased. I want to make sure, like I'm like Ryan's noticing the same thing. Chase is noticing the same thing, that's all the converse feedback. But like, I'm like, we're fucking biased. We want to hear biased. Don't like. Let's let's make sure. Because, like I, you know, I if you're gonna if somebody's gonna if I'm gonna bother training people26100:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.100The Alliance: and the end of the day, I want them to walk away and be like that was one of the coolest things I ever did.26200:47:57.360 --> 00:47:57.980Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.26300:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.740The Alliance: I. By the way, I also believe truthfully, for all the reasons that you listed.26400:48:06.720 --> 00:48:12.500The Alliance: it's gonna be like that. We'll finish in September in December26500:48:12.890 --> 00:48:29.119The Alliance: people are going to be like, Oh, wow! That was one of the coolest things I ever did, because by December enough things will have onboarded into their life, and enough changes will have showed up that it'll like it'll start, I think that's my guess. This is my prediction also.26600:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.270The Alliance: Anyways.26700:48:30.270 --> 00:48:38.770Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: The other. The other piece of feedback I'd give. And I think you said D. Amanda's told you this is that the people will really enjoy the the group work and all that kind of thing.26800:48:38.880 --> 00:48:46.950Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: What I've noticed is, I mean, if you're attracting professionals that want this kind of work.26900:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.880Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: they're not generalists. Typically right, they're they're already pretty specialized.27000:48:52.370 --> 00:49:00.679Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: And what I found in the in the calls, I mean, I got a lot of them reaching out wanting time on the calendar. Let's get together, and it's it's great. I mean, it's it's a networking thing.27100:49:01.040 --> 00:49:11.050Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: But my Mtp. Is so specialized in that kind of thing, and everybody else's is that I didn't actually get that value out of it. The biggest value I got27200:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.960Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: is the when we're having the open discussions. That's great.27300:49:15.640 --> 00:49:26.169Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: The interaction with the other members not as valuable for me. It's cool. I made meeting nice people, and and that'll be really cool when we get to New York, of course, so that you've got that connection.27400:49:26.400 --> 00:49:43.940Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Guest speakers were huge, I mean, man, I there was so much material in there that I just jumped in some of these people. I've never even heard about that thing that was really, really valuable. But that doesn't even need to be a guest speaker that can just be a hey? You need to check out this or this, and you know, just tap into your27500:49:44.526 --> 00:49:47.940Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: resources in that way that was really valuable.27600:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.050Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Does that make sense.27700:49:52.340 --> 00:50:01.818The Alliance: Yeah, no, that's all. That's actually awesome. That's interesting. On the the collaboration front. I can see that I27800:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.002The Alliance: and I also.27900:50:06.050 --> 00:50:27.359The Alliance: one of the things that I figure with the collaboration stuff is, I don't really believe you're gonna find those kinds of collaborators in 4 months. I really don't. I think you can plant the seeds and get people enough people in the room together that are doing similar things that things like that evolve over time. I like. Personally, I think 4 months is28000:50:27.850 --> 00:50:38.428The Alliance: a little early to Russian business with somebody. You know what I mean to actually collaborate with them. I like to know the people I work with for a while. You know what I mean. But neither here nor there.28100:50:38.890 --> 00:50:53.669The Alliance: on that one that's interesting feedback. Okay, we're also trying to figure out like, what if I want to keep something ongoing for the people in the lines? You just wanna sort of stay like, what does that look like? And the28200:50:54.500 --> 00:51:16.080The Alliance: you know? And and I'm and I still don't know, like I'm just trying to figure out what what was the most valuable. You know thing that we could do together that like would work to do it ongoing and like, would actually even fit in my life and everybody else's life, and and make sense financially. I don't know what that looks like. I haven't solved that yet, but I'm getting that the more I mean, I know I sort of know28300:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.269The Alliance: Ryan, and I think, like we, we're pretty sure28400:51:20.820 --> 00:51:44.829The Alliance: there's a version where it's like one literally like one group coaching. Call a month and then a couple of meetups and one annual event. For like just a really low tech thing for people who just want to keep going keep training with the same people. We're looking at that. And then we're looking at. We're poking at other options. It's it's a little complicated, but like a fun problem solved.28500:51:45.320 --> 00:51:51.089Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: It is. I. I think you know, I thought about this right when you were doing that, you're bringing on the guest speakers, I'm, like28600:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.399Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: this feels podcastish, which I would tune in every single time. So if I'm looking at.28700:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.510The Alliance: Oh, so with the guest speakers. That's what we're doing for cause I can't. The thing with the guest speakers is28800:52:02.940 --> 00:52:10.009The Alliance: now. Sarah and Annie will come in, because, like, I think, Annie got 3 jobs out of it. You know what I mean. So like28900:52:10.130 --> 00:52:17.990The Alliance: they're both happy to come in because they know it's gonna turn to. It's gonna be lead Gen. For their them at some point. But like29000:52:18.200 --> 00:52:31.350The Alliance: we're gonna record the net like this next week. We're recording it right? Because it's you we've got Jody Levy, and Ivy Ross in a room together. I mean, they're friends, but like these are29100:52:31.580 --> 00:52:54.969The Alliance: 2 of the most dynamic female leaders in the world today. I mean, they're brilliant. And they lead really creative organizations. And they're really good at creating creative teams. It's gonna be an amazing conversation, and I can get them to do it once. But I can't get them to do it repeatedly for 15 people. They're gonna be like fuck you, Steven, you know what I mean, like, we love you. But we don't love you that much. But if I put it out as a podcast29200:52:55.100 --> 00:53:04.639The Alliance: now, they're fucking excited. Because now they're getting because they these, they get enough. They don't get enough attention than a podcast like.29300:53:04.640 --> 00:53:25.140The Alliance: it's still a big deal for them to get on podcasts. They're not the most frequent guests up so like that still works a little bit, though I could be on everybody's podcast if she wanted to. But so I have like, it's, there's a like, I've got A, I could do certain things just to get off the ground here that I can't do29400:53:25.370 --> 00:53:36.673The Alliance: ongoing but we can bring people in and do like podcast discussions and then open it up for questions, and put that out as the podcast and.29500:53:37.050 --> 00:53:45.700Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That's the interesting thing to me. Because, can you? I think you could monetize that in some way like, if you think about, I mean, you obviously have.29600:53:45.910 --> 00:53:51.880Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you could do a podcast and and just do a podcast that kind of thing. But then, if you're creating this group.29700:53:52.210 --> 00:53:59.840Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and I think here's the thing. If I go back to my comment about the the interconnectivity and the collaboration, that kind of thing, I think29800:54:00.440 --> 00:54:18.940Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: the more busy you are, and the higher you're focused, the less you want that kind of stuff. I just want to get on and get my training and that kind of thing. So I'm not really interested in that group thing which elevates you to a place where you're you're grabbing people that will pay $75,000 to be part of something that's 4 months right? Because I know it's just29900:54:19.050 --> 00:54:34.140Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: purely about me. I know I'm going to be in a group. But so there's that part. But then, if that group is continuing to grow. Now, you've got this tribe. Where would I pay to have private podcasts where it's not a public. Podcast30000:54:34.250 --> 00:54:42.609Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Steven's just like, Hey, based on what people are talking about. I've reached out to this person, I'm having a conversation with them. It's a podcast and a zoom mixed30100:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.579Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: because you're a member. If you pay an ongoing fee, you get access to that.30200:54:48.100 --> 00:55:00.140Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you know, maybe you get access to hey, shoot me an email, and I'll I'll be able to answer it at some point in time. Hey? I'm I'm struggling with this that kind of thing. And to your team. That's an ongoing service that I think would be very good.30300:55:00.380 --> 00:55:07.779The Alliance: Yeah, that's I. That what? The? It's funny because, the biggest problem is30400:55:08.020 --> 00:55:18.798The Alliance: what I love. This is the stuff I I like these one on ones a lot right like they don't feel like coaching at all. They just feel like I'm having conversations with people I like30500:55:19.550 --> 00:55:46.249The Alliance: And, by the way, that may just be like we're doing that I'm doing like 3 a month, and like that may like that may end up being what like there might be like 6 slots for the alliances, just like a phone call a month blah blah and you know, and one group call, or something like that. And it's just that which might just, you know, we're gonna I'm gonna test lots of things and see sort of what happens. And some of it's about like.30600:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.590The Alliance: if I find a family fund that wants to like30700:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.389The Alliance: sort of fund our Ptsd research and the like, the research, if if that like, if I can30800:55:54.790 --> 00:56:01.480The Alliance: get enough cash in there, it lowers the amount of30900:56:01.680 --> 00:56:24.033The Alliance: time I have to spend doing. You know what I mean, and I can't tell yet. I think that that project, like we're ready to. We're finally ready to move on it because the all the research is done. I think the team's locked, and I think we have protocol. We're close to protocols. So now it's just a question of like finding quarter 1 million dollars in like nonprofit starter cash. They like get the protocol tested.31000:56:24.440 --> 00:56:41.870The Alliance: but if that's up and running it, it, there's my have bigger options. Then, because I got a bunch of scientists who are working with me, and I can bring people in. I can more stuff I can do so we'll see. And I'm excited by it. I'm liking everything I like. The fact that, like31100:56:42.490 --> 00:56:46.759The Alliance: this is, I've got the data I wanted. I don't have the all the data. But I thought31200:56:46.930 --> 00:56:50.459The Alliance: I'd have more answers by the end of this, and I do.31300:56:50.760 --> 00:57:11.059Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I mean, oh, yeah, overall. I mean, these are, and I think that's the thing is like, you know the one thing that's really troubling for me, and I'm sure you experience it, too, is people are like, Oh, you got to read this. You got to read that you got to read this and have you checked out this? Podcast I'm like, fuck. You don't know anything about me. You're not asking any questions about what I need31400:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.440Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: or when I'm stuck. I don't have time to read all your books.31500:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.060The Alliance: So, yeah, so you. And so this is funny, Blair, I have a whole long speech about this, which is about31600:57:19.180 --> 00:57:29.970The Alliance: people don't understand the thing with the fucking Internet is, the gatekeepers are gone. So there's nobody doing quality control. There's nobody. It's magazines I used to know, like31700:57:30.100 --> 00:57:59.340The Alliance: I knew, for in the nineties Gq. Was going to cover 7 topics that I really fucking cared about because they just I was there. Read blah blah! You know what I mean. Those gatekeepers are gone. I've been saying this for a while, that in the future this is actually what I think my job is right now is to curate like people along like, based on who they are, the path to knowledge. Because I like, you're going to be hard pressed to find somebody with a breadth of knowledge as big, like31800:57:59.340 --> 00:58:12.700The Alliance: as big as mine. So like, this is actually a thing I can do really well, so like. And I realize I said this to somebody I was like, I think there's a i think this is actually part of what we're doing here. So it's interesting with the collaboration thing, Blair.31900:58:13.820 --> 00:58:19.880The Alliance: I really, when I built the Alliance, what I thought was guys like us.32000:58:20.380 --> 00:58:37.570The Alliance: we don't actually want anybody to collaborate with, for all the reasons you pointed out. What we actually want is people to hang out with who we don't work with, and we don't pay, who are have overlapping interests. That's what I like.32100:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.000Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: What?32200:58:38.000 --> 00:58:53.579The Alliance: Like that. Literally like, I like collaborate. We had. We did the collaboration stuff because a lot of people wanted it. And we are. It's part of what we're doing. But I, personally, and with you I was like, I don't don't fucking. I don't wanna collaborate with anybody.32300:58:53.580 --> 00:58:53.910Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Like.32400:58:53.910 --> 00:59:18.509The Alliance: That's their hand chosen by me. Don't like fuck. You collaborate with somebody I don't like. Are you crazy when time is busy? But fuck. Do I need to go hang out with some like people I don't know. I don't work with who do other things for a living. Who can. Just you know that. Yes, like, that's what deal that's real like. That's what I felt.32500:59:18.510 --> 00:59:37.769The Alliance: The people who want the collaboration of the people who are earlier on in their career. One of the things and I'll tell you this, but I can't say this out loud to most of the one of the things we did is we adjusted well, one. The price went to $46,000. So that took a lot of the people who were at the front end of stuff out32600:59:37.990 --> 00:59:44.400The Alliance: just right off the bat right? And we also increased the32700:59:44.880 --> 00:59:55.889The Alliance: we didn't. There's no basic like we'll let anybody you know what I mean, like, we'll look at anybody. But as a general rule, the average monthly income went well, like.32800:59:55.890 --> 01:00:18.930The Alliance: you know, it's north of it's north. It's probably in the second group. It's probably north of 100 at this point. And that was another adjustment. I wanted to make just to see. Like I. It's a it's a slightly different group because they're not. They don't have that like dying hunger. They're like, this will be fun. I want to keep learning. I want to like like32901:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.179The Alliance: they're not Mtv.33001:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.750Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: There's a there's a sweet spot in there, isn't there? Yeah.33101:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.299The Alliance: Yeah, well, and I, by the way.33201:00:24.610 --> 01:00:37.360The Alliance: I don't know I like I it's been so long since I've met, hung out with people with my cause. I mean, like I've gotten to know the alliance better than I've gotten to know my customers in a really fucking long time, right like, which is what I want33301:00:38.050 --> 01:00:43.499The Alliance: is what I you know what I mean. Like, I really that's what I was missing. And so that like, it's been delightful. But like.33401:00:44.020 --> 01:00:50.320The Alliance: yeah, it's it, is. It is an interesting question. Oh.33501:00:51.350 --> 01:00:55.910The Alliance: cause the people who do want the collaboration and the breakout groups are33601:00:56.060 --> 01:01:00.270The Alliance: less farther along on the journey. All I wanted33701:01:00.420 --> 01:01:09.869The Alliance: was co-training around flow triggers, so we could like that because that was centrally focused and like that made sense to me. But33801:01:10.870 --> 01:01:29.229The Alliance: This is all like I, you know. I'm gathering feedback one at a time with my, you know, this might. This gets to be a last one on one call. So like, okay at the end of the call. Tell me what you thought. I'm and I'm really excited this wait to show you guys the the cool AI on the back end that.33901:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.740Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, yeah.34001:01:29.740 --> 01:01:42.259The Alliance: It's neat, it's neat I like I was. I was very surprised. But I was like, God damn! Is this useful like? It's really good at like analyzing all this stuff. And of course we have, like now, 90Êmin of our conversation that gets fed into it.34101:01:43.150 --> 01:01:52.189Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You know what I I think you hit the nail on the head of something that just as soon as you said it, I'm like, wow! That is scalable.34201:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.210Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You can monetize that.34301:01:55.340 --> 01:02:04.379Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: And you think about, you know, one of the. And I don't know if it was you or somebody else that I was just reading about saying one of the biggest changes in the last 100 years is the loss of the editor.34401:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.960Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and how much that has changed society34501:02:08.569 --> 01:02:21.339Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: as somebody that's got a busy counter and that kind of thing. I want somebody that I can't remember the word you use for it. But you're curating. I'll pay, because I know that I'm interested in the same things.34601:02:21.540 --> 01:02:42.569Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I'm interested in the same social things, the same music, and all that kind of thing. I think you and I are like in the same way that I'm fairly introverted like I. I can be extroverted, but it fucking tires me out, so if I go to something I'll go hard at it, that kind of thing, and then I need a day to just sit with my book and read it, and that kind of thing, but I'm looking for curation.34701:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.210Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and I'll pay for curation, which means that.34801:02:45.210 --> 01:03:01.979The Alliance: Yeah, there's a it's funny. Rick Walken was telling me. This is he? Said he. It was literally like he was like Steven. If I will pay you a hundred $1,000 a year if you do. One group Q&A a month, and like 4 small dinners34901:03:02.170 --> 01:03:17.829The Alliance: with cool people at the dinner, and maybe like a Scott, very confident like, you know that sort. And I was like, I was like, you know, that we could do like that. That's a that's interesting. That's a model that could kind of work. That's a lot of money for that. I know. You might be the only one35001:03:19.610 --> 01:03:27.063The Alliance: very nice to you. That's a lot of money. I don't know if I would pay that like, wow, okay, I don't know. Yeah. So35101:03:27.510 --> 01:03:30.910The Alliance: it's a lot of it is really about like.35201:03:31.940 --> 01:03:42.699The Alliance: you know, time, money, effort, kind of that sort of stuff. And how it doesn't. The good news with this this group and me will be meetings. Nobody really demands. Fancy35301:03:43.600 --> 01:03:43.930Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.35401:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.721The Alliance: Which is which is useful.35501:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.120Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Awesome. Yeah.35601:03:47.330 --> 01:03:58.910The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, like, if I do, CEO weekends, those will probably have to be a little fancier, because it's CEO weekends. You know what I mean like but anyways, you're coming to New York.35701:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.270Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah. Yeah. Got everything. Booked.35801:04:01.780 --> 01:04:09.130The Alliance: Nice. I have no idea it's not gonna be terrible.35901:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.359The Alliance: It could be really, really weird.36001:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.390Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay.36101:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.800The Alliance: Could be really weird. I have no like there are.36201:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.349The Alliance: We've seen pictures of the subway station we'd have like.36301:04:24.350 --> 01:04:24.780Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, yeah.36401:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.229The Alliance: It looks really cool. We like chat a lot.36501:04:28.640 --> 01:04:36.730The Alliance: but like we don't know and what kind of event Jack is, gonna throw in the evening to our cop like we have no idea.36601:04:37.530 --> 01:04:43.519The Alliance: And and Scott Barry Kaufman is going to do an hour long.36701:04:43.730 --> 01:04:45.490The Alliance: Mentalism36801:04:45.780 --> 01:05:13.250The Alliance: show that explains the psychology like he's. You're going to use psychology to like. Explain how he's fooling you while like I don't. Necessarily, I think this is like he's been wanting to do this. He's been doing magic for a while. It's been getting better. He's been getting better, and he begged me he was like, Can I do a magic show, and I said, I think what he meant was, can I walk around? Do close up magic? But I took it wrong, and I thought he was going to do this. And now. So he, we're all we're doing this. We have no idea what that's gonna look like.36901:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.720Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That is unbelievable.37001:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.010The Alliance: Scott Barry Kaufman can get canceled37101:05:19.320 --> 01:05:26.960The Alliance: in most environments like he's the most non PC person you could possibly imagine. So37201:05:27.460 --> 01:05:32.390The Alliance: I think he's gonna be fine with this group. I know Bruce is gonna be fine.37301:05:33.937 --> 01:05:36.060Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, totally. Yeah.37401:05:36.450 --> 01:05:37.100Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, my God.37501:05:37.100 --> 01:05:48.530The Alliance: Like, it's really like, it's really an interesting question, like, there's the I you can put together something exciting that you think is really really cool, but you sort of got to roll the dice a little bit.37601:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.090The Alliance: Yeah, and especially.37701:05:50.090 --> 01:05:52.430Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: With a group like with a group. You don't know. Right? Yeah.37801:05:54.160 --> 01:05:54.930Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Bigger group.37901:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.569The Alliance: The here's the truth of the matter.38001:05:58.540 --> 01:06:05.149The Alliance: the things I do know we're gonna do, which is like, figure out what the blueprint use the AI and figure out what the blueprint is for next year, and38101:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.238The Alliance: through the after action breakout and the38201:06:12.100 --> 01:06:18.190The Alliance: conversation with Scott, Barry Kaufman and me and Sarah Sarkis like that like38301:06:18.500 --> 01:06:34.663The Alliance: that alone is like the the fact that you guys get a 90Êmin conversation with the 3 of us together is fucking cuckoo, and the fact that I got Scott and Sarah to agree to it. I don't know why my friends are so nice. It's really crazy.38401:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.450The Alliance: But38501:06:37.390 --> 01:06:45.710The Alliance: that'll be like those things are. Gonna be amazing. The things around it that I think are gonna be really cool. We hope that's all I can say. We hope.38601:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.250Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, it'll be fantastic. Yeah, it's.38701:06:48.250 --> 01:06:48.720The Alliance: No.38801:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.240Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So, looking forward to it.38901:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.370The Alliance: So we charge $36,000 for the 1st one.39001:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.730The Alliance: We were Golden Fraser, because we don't know.39101:06:57.930 --> 01:06:58.570Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.39201:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.380The Alliance: That's awesome.39301:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.080Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I'm looking forward to it.39401:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.339The Alliance: Thank you, sir.39501:07:02.630 --> 01:07:03.929Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Alright have a great weekend.39601:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.260The Alliance: You, too, be good.
