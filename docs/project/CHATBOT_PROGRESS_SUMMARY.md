## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### **Test Component Available**
We've created a `ChatbotTest` component that you can use to:
- Test different client profiles
- Verify OpenAI API integration
- Check client data availability
- Debug any integration issues

### **Key Test Questions**
Try these questions to verify the chatbot is working:
- "How am I performing compared to other clients?"
- "What are my key areas for growth?"
- "How can I leverage my profile strengths?"
- "What specific actions should I take this week?"

### **Expected Responses**
- **OpenAI API**: Intelligent, contextual, personalized responses
- **Mock API**: Good quality responses with specific data references
- **Fallback**: Automatic switch if OpenAI fails

## üîç What to Look For

### **Success Indicators**
- ‚úÖ Chatbot appears in all dashboards
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API calls succeed (check browser console)
- ‚úÖ Responses are intelligent and personalized
