WEBVTT100:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.840Courtney Karnes: Hello! Hello!200:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.160The Alliance: And yeah.300:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.930Courtney Karnes: Can you hear me? Oh, you can't!400:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.560The Alliance: Ham.500:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.560Courtney Karnes: I'm right. How are you?600:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.820The Alliance: I'm excellent. How are you?700:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.200Courtney Karnes: Great. Actually, I'm doing well and.800:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.140The Alliance: More wildlife. I, freaking love it. I love the giraffes. Now we get leopards. It's just dope.900:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.939The Alliance: It's like Marlon Perkins. Every time I see you. It's it's phenomenal.1000:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.800The Alliance: I'm just sad.1100:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.720Courtney Karnes: I gotta have that. Be my wardrobe driver, then, for this thing, maybe that's it.1200:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.259The Alliance: Okay, fair enough, fair enough. What were you saying? I'd be very rudely interrupted you to comment your clothing choice.1300:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.930Courtney Karnes: No, I you said, how are you doing? I said. I'm great.1400:01:36.350 --> 00:01:46.990Courtney Karnes: I feel I feel energized and happy, and like I need more time in the day to do all the checklists that you gave me. But I'm getting it done, and I'm digging it.1500:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.747The Alliance: That's phenomenal. Let me so1600:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.160The Alliance: I'll give you the why first, st and then I'll go into my 1st question.1700:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.610Courtney Karnes: Okay.1800:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.429The Alliance: So I talked a little bit a little about this. When I am interested in learning, I try to.1900:02:01.870 --> 00:02:11.259The Alliance: When I'm reading, I look for those moments where, like my brain goes, wow! What the fuck that's so cool. And it goes off like those moments of emotional wow2000:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.130The Alliance: cause I'm already remembering them like I've already had a big emotional reaction. So I take the time to write them down, or whatever they stick. They stay with me. So2100:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.638The Alliance: one of the sort of advantages disadvantages. Secret plot behind the fire hose approach to our day is2200:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.390The Alliance: Hurry2300:02:33.840 --> 00:02:46.850The Alliance: all the stuff and see what sticks, and see what really resonated? Because that often answers the next question, which is like the fuck, do I start? What do I prioritize? How do I sift and sort. What the hell2400:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.240The Alliance: yeah2500:02:47.240 --> 00:02:59.560The Alliance: happened to me. So I always like to start with our own sort of biology and neurobiology and our own excitement as a guide. So what stuck with you? What sort of resonated, what has sort of2600:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.499The Alliance: operationalized itself? And what have you been looking at? Going? Wow! If I could operationalize this. I think it's a big lever.2700:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.310Courtney Karnes: Hmm! I've had a few unlocks. Actually, one is I?2800:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.420Courtney Karnes: Well, about you. I realize that you are actually addicted to flow, and like any good drug like you'll do anything to2900:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.960Courtney Karnes: orchestrate your life so that you get that best hit. And I was like, Oh, it's it's really no different, and I and I3000:03:33.070 --> 00:03:46.732Courtney Karnes: it resonates with me because I feel it as well. You just have, like a discipline and a rigor to unlock that for yourself many times a day, and your experience of flow versus my experience of flow, let's say, like in a3100:03:47.260 --> 00:04:07.030Courtney Karnes: like a physical environment, or like doing a sport when I'm like, actually that energizes me, and it doesn't deplete me. Sometimes I have a hard time reintegrating into life after and having patience for my family, or whatever, because I'm like, oh, you're not what what that was, right? So it's really hard to like adjust.3200:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.519Courtney Karnes: But but perhaps there's different levels of flow, and3300:04:13.880 --> 00:04:25.140Courtney Karnes: some of which I could tap more deeply, into which might be either more depleting or more feeding or more unlocking, and I find that interesting. But for you I was like Oh, my God! It is like any proper addict that has3400:04:25.700 --> 00:04:35.730Courtney Karnes: yours is just a healthy addiction, but you've orchestrated your life around getting those maximum hits. And now you're helping people do the same, which I found interesting. But that's just an observation.3500:04:36.020 --> 00:04:47.260The Alliance: One word of clock, one word, one word of caution there, because I've seen this go right and wrong like you made a great insight, and I want to emphasize it. And then I want to tell you I've seen this go slightly wrong for people, and I wanna show you why.3600:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.770Courtney Karnes: Yeah, yeah.3700:04:48.141 --> 00:04:58.909The Alliance: So one. The insight is is correct. The people who are excellent at this flow, and getting into flow, it becomes that becomes the center of everything they do.3800:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.430Courtney Karnes: Because.3900:04:59.430 --> 00:05:23.000The Alliance: It's optimal performance. And once you're optimized for flow, everything optimizes right? It sort of just it feeds back. So that's a very acute and important thing to stop. And yes, this is very true where I've seen it go wild and weird. So there's a joke about my dear friend and partner, Peter. Madness, which is Peter constraints his entire life. So Peter is always in flow, but nobody who works for him is ever in flow.4000:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.730Courtney Karnes: Oh!4100:05:24.460 --> 00:05:41.420The Alliance: So you have to. You have to be fucking careful, right? This is such CEO narcissistic behavior, right like. And I'm not in flow. And the other thing that you see with lawyers. So this there's an inverse to this that's even. That's probably something you're seeing in in your people you work with4200:05:41.830 --> 00:05:54.779The Alliance: is a notice of my brother, by the way, so my brother's a skier, so he definitely knows what flow is, and he, you know, gets into it, but he works, and his job, being a lawyer, denies him a flow. It's a very hard profession.4300:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.400Courtney Karnes: Back.4400:05:55.400 --> 00:06:13.929The Alliance: Facing. So the the perspective being a lawyer forces you to have, plus the expert. Mind, the expert. You're always an expert. Nobody's ever. You never want to be casual. If you're a lawyer, you're the expert. As a result. That's a fixed mindset. So a fixed mindset locks you right? It's it's so there's a bunch of stuff that spirals4500:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.340The Alliance: from there. Which is this like sort of like weird4600:06:20.040 --> 00:06:30.290The Alliance: push back to people who also are going to stick their lives around flow, which is interesting. I've seen both. I've seen all those things. Okay. So that was the 1st unlock observation. What else.4700:06:30.290 --> 00:06:51.880Courtney Karnes: So so actually, your word of caution is a good one, because what actually it taps into I don't want to spend time on this yet I do want to get there at some point which is your comment about my energy, which I am just starting to see as a super tool for myself, which I've never seen it as such, because I regularly get positive feedback about it.4800:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.639Courtney Karnes: and I just overlook it like, Oh, it just happens you know what I mean?4900:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.560The Alliance: So I call those invisible skills. And I, I think5000:07:01.730 --> 00:07:10.330The Alliance: being able to identify your invisible skills are the secret to properly cultivating passion, purpose and high flow lifestyle5100:07:10.330 --> 00:07:34.065The Alliance: cause they're really indicative of, like your natural sweet spots and strengths. We know if you work in such a way that you're using new strengths and new ways all the time super fucking flowy like Sue. That's Martin's flow work. When he jumped into flow with strengths and values, and it was the clearest thing when our when what's driving us into flow, alliance strengths and values?5200:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.759The Alliance: everything clicks into gear. This is the work I do with companies? Right? What's your mission statement? Those are your values. What are your strengths?5300:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.000The Alliance: What are the flow triggers that sit in the middle.5400:07:43.410 --> 00:07:57.620Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I think that in relation to that, I have. My husband's always like. Your energy is very powerful, and if you're not in a state where, if your flow is disrupting others to your point about Peter like?5500:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.070Courtney Karnes: Thanks.5600:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.890Courtney Karnes: So it he hasn't used those words, but I think it's just an interesting5700:08:02.130 --> 00:08:20.643Courtney Karnes: perspective that you just offered, that I just had the other couple of things that I've pulled from this so far are the meditation piece I read I meditate regularly, and I do enjoy Joe Dispenza, which I've shared with you, but I also have realized that I think I'm a noise in junkie like5800:08:21.280 --> 00:08:40.379Courtney Karnes: The content is always coming in, which means it makes it really difficult to process through and then take things to the next level. If you're constantly listening to some type of content. And sitting in this very silent meditation that you have us doing has given me actually very powerful visualizations.5900:08:40.820 --> 00:08:49.809The Alliance: During it, while I'm focusing on my breath. I've had like an unlock there, which is, you know, super cool like from my own self versus.6000:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.999The Alliance: Oh, that is so great!6100:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.770The Alliance: It's a he's great right, like the declutter, the vibe dude.6200:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.280Courtney Karnes: Yeah.6300:08:56.280 --> 00:09:18.729The Alliance: I searched long, and, by the way, you'll appreciate I wanted so badly. I was like, I feel terrible that I'm giving you a white male who to draw with, and a what clearly sounds like a white male, the coach. But like I literally like I went, I tried to find any other. I even thought about hiring my friends, who are female meditation, Gurus, to just do. And I was like, let's test it 1st6400:09:18.850 --> 00:09:29.859The Alliance: cause I know, like it bugged. It bugs me. But this guy had declutter. The vine is so damn good. Yeah, Toby, loose sketch is so damn good that I'm sort of like this is what I use, and it like.6500:09:30.770 --> 00:09:37.910The Alliance: I like the fact that he pauses just long enough for the thing he's about to tell you to happen.6600:09:38.440 --> 00:09:54.689The Alliance: It's never like I can't stand the meditation teachers who just talk straight to the meditation. Because what are you doing? That's not actually meditation. Now, I'm listening to a lecture that's a different. It's a cool skill, right? I'm learning, but like not meditation. And the whole point is, you have to watch your mind.6700:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.420Courtney Karnes: Yeah.6800:09:56.070 --> 00:10:13.519Courtney Karnes: totally that I found very interesting in in the 2. I think I've done 2 sessions with maybe a couple. But in 2 of the sessions. I've had pretty strong visual realizations, and I thought that that was super cool, and one of them was that like, oh, the space to process! Go ahead.6900:10:13.520 --> 00:10:21.309The Alliance: Yeah, no, that's exactly what I was gonna tell you. So this is this is like big signal big signal, so like what7000:10:21.340 --> 00:10:49.449The Alliance: it's telling you is building in a few more. These are release activities. Right? In your case, you're basically you don't have enough incubation. If you think about the creative cycle. There's not enough incubation, and I've been around you just long enough to know that, like your fucking mind moves at a million miles an hour. And it, you know, you synthesize really fast and really well and like, I'm seeing how you're processing this stuff. But if you're not giving yourself any place to put it.7100:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.180Courtney Karnes: Hmm.7200:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.530The Alliance: You know what I mean? Yeah.7300:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.080Courtney Karnes: Yeah.7400:10:52.300 --> 00:11:13.959The Alliance: You're not letting it. And the other thing is what you're really doing is you're short changing yourself lateral thinking, right? You can get to the pattern recognition. Because you're moving so fast, you got a quick brain. It'll do the pattern recognition. But you need the incubation for it to actually stretch out into those areas that's gonna have impact. I would guess I would guess.7500:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.350Courtney Karnes: I think that's.7600:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.099The Alliance: This is what we're going to discover as you run this, the pasta experiment.7700:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.970The Alliance: Yeah, I think I think that's a that's a really good.7800:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.990Courtney Karnes: That tracks that tracks with what I'm experiencing, because what I also realized is7900:11:32.810 --> 00:11:44.920Courtney Karnes: without pausing and creating space to have both both the process and the place to put the things so that they can be so that they I can build upon them.8000:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.470The Alliance: Is this?8100:11:45.470 --> 00:12:10.780Courtney Karnes: Just a fragmented experience with a lot of disjointed information or realizations. But I do best when I have the map, when I know where one thing that I'm doing tracks to another priority, and I can kind of move them. And it's all about the you know your what you call the Mtp. And then the high, hard goals. If I don't have a place to put actions that I'm8200:12:11.010 --> 00:12:21.940Courtney Karnes: spending my time and energy on up under one of those pillars. I really struggle, and if I can't place it, I find myself flailing and constantly trying to place it8300:12:22.100 --> 00:12:28.539Courtney Karnes: so that it's distracting to the forward progress, and I can give an example. But I'll I'll pause to let you go.8400:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.576The Alliance: No. So I mean my question with 2 questions, one,8500:12:33.390 --> 00:12:50.720The Alliance: Do you have a note taking system? Do you like? How do you file things away. And you you said something about like if I don't have a place to put it. Are you talking about mental frameworks like mental structures? I'm that way right? And or physical structures. And or8600:12:51.490 --> 00:13:08.280The Alliance: the obvious question, here is, AI is really good at putting taking our notes, putting them in the proper places and finding the connections between to help, you know. So it strikes me as like, those are my 3 questions, are you using? AI? What's your note taking system. And what are your mental category? How do you do that?8700:13:08.280 --> 00:13:30.810Courtney Karnes: I am using AI, and I find that I need it to mean something, because AI is really good at giving you information overload. Right? So you're like holy shit, like I've just had, like 7, you know, actual self actualizing moments through this machine. And I'm not exactly ready for them, because I'm not giving myself the place to process in them. So I have to be really mindful about how I use AI, because otherwise I'm just operating as8800:13:30.890 --> 00:13:48.810Courtney Karnes: directed by the machine versus internalized and and placed in myself so that it can have an intentional purpose. That's 1 but 2. I do have a note taking process, and I'm pretty rigorous with my notes. But what I just realized yesterday, when I was walking the dog, I was like.8900:13:49.040 --> 00:14:11.569Courtney Karnes: Oh, my God! The systems that I use at work could also be the systems that I use in life. Like I am. I am very much working on being one person, one person at work, one person in life, and having that energy flow with the same consistency through yes, dial up or down, but like I don't want to make concessions in life anymore. I think it's too precious and too sweet to waste.9000:14:11.570 --> 00:14:31.359Courtney Karnes: And so, having not just in where I focus my energy, time efforts and skills. But also in how I track my progress and momentum. So the types of things that I build for work can also be built for myself, because that's the way my brain works, and it doesn't need to be 2 different9100:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.009Courtney Karnes: systems. You know what I mean. So now I'm.9200:14:34.010 --> 00:14:39.809The Alliance: So let let me let. Okay, so this sounds like which, by the way, one of the goals I'm coming.9300:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.659The Alliance: I want to come out of here with is9400:14:42.870 --> 00:15:00.149The Alliance: popular. Load, yours, mine. We can hold 3 things. So my goal. The other end of this is, what are the 3 things that we should add or do over the next month. Right? That I should make Ryan hold you accountable for that are gonna be the biggest leverage it sounds like9500:15:01.450 --> 00:15:14.740The Alliance: at if you don't at least want to start importing them. Figure out which of the work systems need to be imported into your life, and what that looks like. And what's the what are the steps you're gonna take over the next month to get that done?9600:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.500Courtney Karnes: Yes, and.9700:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.340The Alliance: Is that a is that a smart goal.9800:15:18.340 --> 00:15:45.510Courtney Karnes: Yes, it is a smart goal, and I've started to do it. I've started to map it so that the same way I'm building strategy for Auric to kind of revolutionize the way we think about client growth and whatever here one I've realized. What I really wanted was what I'm doing here and getting paid for on the daily to map into who I am and the scorecard that I'm building in life right like I want it to add up to something, and not just collect a paycheck here and have it be disjointed.9900:15:45.510 --> 00:16:08.140Courtney Karnes: and I do believe that it does, and the process by which I am designing that strategy for Auric. I'm also taking that same strategy in my own personal life around the Mtp. And the high, hard goals, so that I've got like this organized structure that I can look at and say, here's how the pieces fit for me, and if it doesn't fit, I think that's a really important pause point to say10000:16:08.300 --> 00:16:19.909Courtney Karnes: it doesn't fit, whereas before I've tried to boil the ocean and said yes to everything. Now I have clarity about who I am, what I'm about, and what I'm aiming to accomplish more clarity I don't totally know yet, but.10100:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.060The Alliance: Yeah, no, let me. I wanna add, I'm gonna give you a quick tool and you have to be.10200:16:25.420 --> 00:16:34.294The Alliance: Do you have to be ruthlessly honest with yourself. This is not a list you always want to share with the world. This is this is just Courtney.10300:16:35.240 --> 00:16:44.400The Alliance: list. Your 10 favorite leisures like whatever they are right, and10400:16:46.510 --> 00:17:14.020The Alliance: they know in all the leader stuff and everything else. If it's not top 10, why would you do it more time on the top 10, no time on the other stuff and and if there's gaps on the top 10, you're like, Oh, my God, I like. I'll give you an example. When I did this I was like, what's my favorite pleasure on the planet. And you know, if we remove a couple of kinky drug field10500:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.240The Alliance: concepts, laughing with my best friend, was at the top of that list.10600:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.730Courtney Karnes: Hmm.10700:17:17.730 --> 00:17:47.170The Alliance: Like period I was. It was just laughing with Michael, either on the phone or in person. I was like, you know, what we work together all the time. So we really take time to be together in person and like, you know what I mean. And I was like holy fuck. This is literally like it's up there with skiing. And like a great writing like this is the best drug ever, and it's not a priority anywhere near my list, and it so feeds my soul. And when I don't get it during the week, holy fuck!10800:17:47.170 --> 00:18:12.020The Alliance: So one thing you know, as we're systematizing and doing that our like pleasures we're going to indulge in whatever it's just about indulging in only those things that really feed sort of your soul at a deep level and banish all the other stuff because it's just like it doesn't feed you at that deep of a level. And when something stops to feed you. You're like, Okay, I no longer compact. Trip is no longer my favorite food in the entire universe.10900:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.520The Alliance: I'll swap something out on the list.11000:18:14.520 --> 00:18:22.539Courtney Karnes: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good good lesson, because it it's not hard for me to extract joy or to like enjoy.11100:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.830The Alliance: No, I'm telling you. I'm telling you list because it's so easy.11200:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.480Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I know.11300:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.209The Alliance: Yeah, it's so easy.11400:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.559The Alliance: There you go.11500:18:29.560 --> 00:18:39.088The Alliance: It is so clear you're a little like me, like you sort of can bring the fun wherever you fucking go, and and it11600:18:40.220 --> 00:18:55.010The Alliance: It's why everybody always thinks you're their best friend. And you're sort of like, huh! That's interesting. And it's because you're you're you're doing. You're filling a deep need that they can't. A lot of people can't fill it for themselves. anyways11700:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.290The Alliance: keep going systematized. We were systematizing your life. That was the insight. And you're and you're already rolling out this strategy.11800:19:02.490 --> 00:19:02.920Courtney Karnes: Yeah.11900:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.409The Alliance: Where do you think you're gonna be in a month?12000:19:06.670 --> 00:19:15.719Courtney Karnes: Hopefully, like a self actualized human already having checked everything off my list and then moving on to the next. I don't know. I12100:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.120Courtney Karnes: where am I?12200:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.170The Alliance: I just went with the systemization of your life. I didn't mean on the path to enlightening.12300:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.449Courtney Karnes: Hey, Courtney, isn't that? Isn't that the goal12400:19:26.480 --> 00:19:43.360Courtney Karnes: that we're doing? I think? I think I'm gonna have. And I'm working toward it like I'm I'm looking at the thing that I'm building right now, which is a Powerpoint presentation. Unfortunately, that's how my brain works, which is like in boxes. And then you know the the flow of thought from there.12500:19:43.360 --> 00:20:00.229Courtney Karnes: I think what I'm going to have is a roadmap to what I believe to be my Mtp. And some of the pillars that support that right, and underneath that some of the high, hard goals that I want to achieve, and the actions that I'm taking now toward it, or at least an idea of when might12600:20:00.310 --> 00:20:10.530Courtney Karnes: I explore something like that? Because, like I said, when you and I 1st met and we were on that call. I was like, I input, everything from my journal into AI, because I felt like I was relearning the same lesson.12700:20:10.530 --> 00:20:10.960The Alliance: Is it.12800:20:10.960 --> 00:20:32.439Courtney Karnes: And over again, and I wanted to build up or forward versus like building in circles, and like rebuild the same room in the house like Sarah Winchester constantly. So I was like, All right. Let me take the insights from my journal from the past year, shove them into AI and help me extract the themes and then realize like, where do I want to double down my time, energy, and efforts?12900:20:32.440 --> 00:20:52.769Courtney Karnes: And I think it's just more honestly, more of that clarity, specificity and intention is what I really want to work on. And it's those things that like brought me to this and to working with you, I do believe, and I think the lack of ability to be clear and specific in life and not honoring13000:20:53.160 --> 00:21:10.279Courtney Karnes: my or our time on this planet to dig into it. More hinders our ability to call in the thing or work toward the thing that is actually supposed to be on the roadmap. And I want to honor this journey by being really clear about that without being short-sighted and narrow minded.13100:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.020Courtney Karnes: That makes sense.13200:21:14.190 --> 00:21:20.759The Alliance: It makes a tremendous amount of sense up, Peter, says Peter Diamandis.13300:21:21.060 --> 00:21:32.510The Alliance: I always say my version is, figure out what your Mtp. Is or your higher goal either. And like, what are the 100 steps13400:21:33.050 --> 00:21:55.789The Alliance: that it's gonna take to get there? And I, it's a hundred is a specific number, because one of the things I've noticed when people set big, hard goals, I mean, I've seen this. I'm gonna talk about it with Sarah tomorrow on our call I've seen it with. I've done a lot of these calls at this point. I'm not saying this is you. I don't actually suspect it is entirely. But I've seen in a lot of people. They have an Mtp. That is13500:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.139The Alliance: untethered to business reality.13600:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.590Courtney Karnes: Hmm.13700:22:00.590 --> 00:22:21.830The Alliance: A little bit where I'm like, like, I hear everything. And I'm like, Okay, but I don't like I've run a lot of companies and seen a lot of companies, and I don't know how that works. I like, I literally like, I don't like. I'm not. There's like 5 new skill sets you're trying to import there that you don't write those kinds of things, and I'm not saying those things are bad.13800:22:21.930 --> 00:22:32.740The Alliance: I'm saying when you force yourself to a hundred list of a hundred. Those things start to become visible, and you start to get the clarity and specific specificity you are looking for. Peter.13900:22:32.740 --> 00:22:55.709The Alliance: Does it differently, he says. Figure out what your Mtp. Is, or figure out what your high, hard goal is and assume. It's gonna take 10 years and possibly longer to get there, and then ask yourself, where do you want to be in 5 years, knowing that 5 years is not the halfway point because it's exponential, right? Everything accelerates and expands and then from 5 years go to 2 and a half years, and from 2 and a half years start working back14000:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.439The Alliance: month by month by month, until you get to today14100:22:58.600 --> 00:23:18.579The Alliance: right like. And he that's how he thinks about it and frames it up, frames it up. I I like that system. I like my system, too. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. But how much work you like to do for clarity and specific specificity, but I think both are super useful, because the the worst thing about a dream14200:23:19.130 --> 00:23:26.974The Alliance: 2 2 things to avoid right is you don't want it, one to turn out to be a phase. You think it's a a purpose, and no, it's actually just a phase,14300:23:27.607 --> 00:23:31.892The Alliance: and then suddenly, you discover one day you have children, and you didn't really want them,14400:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.053The Alliance: and or14500:23:35.850 --> 00:23:59.209The Alliance: the flip side is. And I've seen this. This is just as bad. People get blindside like they think we could. We sort of believe that just because, like we're building out of love, it must come in right. And that does. That doesn't mean we get to outsource like common sense and business sense. And the fact that the world is competitive, even if we're trying to be cooperative and all like all that stuff. And so I try to like.14600:23:59.510 --> 00:24:14.309The Alliance: I try to make sure people are seeing that because otherwise, when you smack into that reality. It just. It deflates the dream, and it's so demotivating. It's hard for people to get back to. They don't learn from those failures they they get taken out for a while by those failures.14700:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.085Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I14800:24:22.350 --> 00:24:31.179Courtney Karnes: I want to show you at some point. I don't know what the agenda is for today. I want to show you where my head is going, because where I get stuck is14900:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.129Courtney Karnes: I get stuck on mapping.15000:24:37.280 --> 00:24:49.080Courtney Karnes: I'm not the peter like I had actually, when I'm not. I know for a fact that my where I'm headed is not a phase, because I have been beating this in my heart since I was a kid. And15100:24:49.130 --> 00:25:15.179Courtney Karnes: I care about humans. I care about achieving potential. I care about a collective experience. And I know my role and power in convening and creating community in the sense of like a collective movement, and I've seen it play out in my career time and time again. So it's been reinforced, and I really enjoy it like I really do enjoy it. And I think what I know is the pieces.15200:25:15.210 --> 00:25:22.629Courtney Karnes: What I'm not confident in is how they fit together, and how that moves forward and where I typically struggle is15300:25:23.100 --> 00:25:45.379Courtney Karnes: when I set out. So pause on that when I set out on this like clarity around kind of where I wanted to go in life with some type of coaching or thought leadership around the concept of potential and helping people see in themselves what they don't see like. I have a gift of seeing strengths in others that they may not realize in themselves, and I have15400:25:45.480 --> 00:25:59.580Courtney Karnes: the ability to kind of ask enough leading questions, or enough curious questions to pull pieces out, to reflect back a version of themselves, that they may not have had the courage to say or voice previously, and15500:25:59.750 --> 00:26:14.630Courtney Karnes: when I had that realization whenever it was, I think it was a year or so ago, I was like, I'm going to give myself 10 years for the 1st time in my life. I don't need to accomplish this goal next month. I don't need to lose a hundred pounds in a week, like all I want to do is in 10.15600:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.970The Alliance: Did you lose a hundred pounds in a week? That's amazing.15700:26:16.970 --> 00:26:36.680Courtney Karnes: No, but if I have a fitness goal, I usually want to achieve it in like 3 weeks flat, like, I'm going to drop 4, 4% body fat in 3 weeks, and then I'm going to die like I usually will break myself trying to hit a goal really fast. But this one I'm like, I'm going to enjoy the process of getting there for the 1st time in my life and not ruin everybody's life in the process. Just let it unfold.15800:26:36.680 --> 00:27:00.419Courtney Karnes: And to me that felt safe and kind of beautiful and fun. And I was like, maybe I'm tapping into something that actually matters to me if I'm willing to give it so much time to blossom versus like this fast hit on achieving something. And so I guess my point is, for the 1st time ever I've done that with this kind of energy with which I'm building. I don't have the total clarity yet, but where I get stuck typically is like15900:27:01.390 --> 00:27:09.300Courtney Karnes: putting it all together in some package that has like smart measurements attached to it. Because I don't actually know.16000:27:09.550 --> 00:27:17.169Courtney Karnes: I don't know how to measure this stuff. So so let me pause there, because I'm just kind of rambling, but that's where my head is at, and I want to at some point show you16100:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.360Courtney Karnes: how my brain is thinking, so you can poke holes in it or ask questions.16200:27:21.670 --> 00:27:29.830The Alliance: So I'm gonna ask you one question, because this is. And I was gonna actually talk about this in the call tomorrow with Sarah, because it's something that I've seen. I see a lot.16300:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.090The Alliance: and.16400:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.040Courtney Karnes: Wait. Do we have a call together with Sarah, or you have a call with Sarah.16500:27:34.040 --> 00:27:53.450The Alliance: We all do. We have a on Thursday we have our our next pop up. It's the digit. 1st digital pop up of the month at 10 o'clock on Thursday. Yeah, it'll be recorded if you're not there. Do not sweat it if you but sarah's great, and but i 1 of the things I've so one of the things16600:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.440The Alliance: I have noticed.16700:27:56.670 --> 00:28:05.430The Alliance: And so this is sort of this is inherent danger in this work at any level is16800:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.139The Alliance: people who get into this work16900:28:09.170 --> 00:28:19.209The Alliance: performance, human performance, etc, etc. There's a pattern that I've seen unfold a million times not entirely different in my own life. In some cases where17000:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.110The Alliance: you get really really good at something excellent.17100:28:22.280 --> 00:28:45.440The Alliance: And then something bad happens. You get sick, you burn out, and then you have to claw your way back and on your way to claw back you discover human performance. Oh, I need a purpose, or oh, it's flow! Or oh, it's whatever it is! You discover the thing that is gonna save you, and you get to the point at the end of it. And you now are a much bigger person you used to be, and you are17200:28:45.440 --> 00:29:01.120The Alliance: craving more. And the challenge is the only thing you actually know is the old thing and the tool that got you to where you are now, which is getting clarity in your case on purpose, and and for those sorts of things17300:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.039The Alliance: where you are next is not always17400:29:06.160 --> 00:29:29.729The Alliance: old thing, plus the tool equals next, sometimes it's old thing, and the tool is a transformation that unlocks the next, and the next is usually a blend of the old thing. And another place where a bunch of your curiosities reside, and the tool is obviously woven through it. It's part of the bedrock, but it's not the thing.17500:29:30.453 --> 00:29:41.489The Alliance: A lot of this is. So I'll give you a really let me give you a really simple example. I finished my book West of Jesus, and I had to. It was a curse book in that, like17600:29:41.700 --> 00:30:05.840The Alliance: I. It was the best I'd ever written. I like I loved it. I thought it was like this perfect book afterwards, and you never want to do that as a writer, because what happens is you can't. How do you equal perfection? And so you get writer's block right? It just totally cripples you. And I spent a really long time trying to pick up. Think of what came next. And the only thing that happened, like some of the time I wrote that book to like where I was at that point was I'd fall in love with my wife.17700:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.320The Alliance: So I tried to pitch my publisher a book on love because it was the thing that had saved.17800:30:11.320 --> 00:30:11.980Courtney Karnes: In a sense.17900:30:12.140 --> 00:30:25.830The Alliance: But nobody would buy it, and my publisher was like dude. You're not a love expert, that's a field like you're a dude who fell in love. And you haven't even love that long at the time, right like, what are you doing? And like18000:30:26.100 --> 00:30:49.320The Alliance: they were right. And actually, the next book was actually the dog sanctuary. We've been doing like the dog work for already 5 years at that point, and I, you know, and I was 3 years, and I was like, Oh, this should be what I write about. But it was, and I didn't see it. It was right in front of my face, and it tied the flow work together with the new thing. But it wasn't the tool that got me there. It was the next thing, and oftentimes people18100:30:49.530 --> 00:30:57.010The Alliance: in their impatience to get to what is next. We mistake the tool for the destination. I'm not saying that's18200:30:57.520 --> 00:31:17.519The Alliance: I'm saying this is a pattern that I've seen play out a lot, and so does it works. And sometimes it leads to a lot of frustration. I see it a lot because people want to get into some kind of flow code, whatever all that stuff. And they don't stop to pause and like, understand really simple things like, if you're going to do high level executive18300:31:17.590 --> 00:31:44.269The Alliance: training of any kind. That means you better have call setters and call bookers and a huge sales team, because the executives don't like to wait when they go to book a call. And suddenly you've now got a monthly overhead that is nowhere in concert with your vision of what you actually wanted to do with your life. But that's the reality of the particular thing that you're talking about, and nobody bothers to stop and go. Oh, I'm in somebody else's field.18400:31:44.410 --> 00:32:05.170The Alliance: This is a fucking field. There are pros here, right? This is why I never go near psychology, and I don't do like you're broken. Here's how to fix you, because there's a whole like, there's a universe of those people, and they're brilliant. I'm not. That's not my expertise. So I, those are like this is not. This is just fodder to think about18500:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.650The Alliance: things in this that said, Show me what you got. I want to see your stuff.18600:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.379Courtney Karnes: So where do you go with that like? That's what breaks me, because I am.18700:32:14.380 --> 00:32:36.840The Alliance: It doesn't have to break. You have to trust 2 things. And it this is the. It's the suckiest thing in the world. You have to trust that your brain, your subconscious, actually do this uncomfortable. I'm not there yet, feeling that's actually exactly what is fun. So your mission is literally to just sort of like, keep feeding it.18800:32:37.270 --> 00:32:52.959The Alliance: Be absorbing and sifting, and be uncomfortable and it and and let let it click because you don't like it's like jumping into a book or a job that you don't want, just because it's next. And you know, or a relationship, we've all we've all done, all of those things.18900:32:53.290 --> 00:33:01.699Courtney Karnes: I know, but I well, I'm a patient one, and I am working on it every day, but also, like.19000:33:03.870 --> 00:33:11.930The Alliance: I'm not saying, don't keep pushing the rock up the hill every day. Do that. Otherwise you go crazy. But, like you have to like19100:33:12.040 --> 00:33:32.839The Alliance: I like. I'm watching what you do. You've got all the right ingredients. You're moving in the right like I don't. I'm not seeing anything where I'm like, oh, this is dumb! I you know what I mean like you do have to sort of remember. How long did it take you to become the woman who was discovering discover her life was going in circles. 1st you had to build the life.19200:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.640Courtney Karnes: 40 40 years. It took me 40.19300:33:34.640 --> 00:33:46.199The Alliance: That's my point, like it took 43 years for you to like. Get to here. Are you absolutely certain that you're going to solve it in like 3 months like don't you deserve.19400:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.109Courtney Karnes: More space than that.19500:33:48.399 --> 00:33:54.770Courtney Karnes: I sure freaking, want to. Okay, look, I'm showing this to you with the full knowledge that it sucks. But that's why.19600:33:54.770 --> 00:34:16.589The Alliance: But here's the here's the other thing I want to tell you. Show it to me, and this is what you're doing now. What you want is a daily creative project that advances your cause and feeds, feeds, that that allows you to express that creativity in a sense, and that, like whatever, and advances this cause. But it doesn't have to be about the destination. You're just writing the book right now.19700:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.010Courtney Karnes: Yeah.19800:34:17.870 --> 00:34:26.690The Alliance: And you know William Gibson used to say, I love. I love going out on book tour because people come up to me and they ask me questions, and I get to figure out what I've been up to these past 5 years.19900:34:30.270 --> 00:34:37.209Courtney Karnes: Oh, okay, here, look, this is like, let's be humbled. Let me just show you this thing, and then we can suffer together.20000:34:37.219 --> 00:34:37.899The Alliance: Do it.20100:34:37.900 --> 00:34:44.839Courtney Karnes: But I but I want you to help me poke holes in it because I don't know if this is this, is it? But like20200:34:45.310 --> 00:35:05.359Courtney Karnes: the idea is to accelerate human thriving in the age of automation. But the real why of that is like, I don't want to leave any ounce of my potential unextracted from myself? Or do I want to see anyone that I love, not realize and achieve their potential? So what does it look like to live a life on purpose for purpose20300:35:05.500 --> 00:35:21.400Courtney Karnes: and in the process. I want to live with people who who are operating at a high frequency, who are buzzing in their own rightful way. But I think if we're thinking about the future of humanity, you have to have a touch into what matters, and makes your heart beat then20400:35:21.520 --> 00:35:32.780Courtney Karnes: to me that's kind of the thought. So then the pillars that support it are growth and potential for me, unlocking opportunities to do this, and I go into a little bit more detail in a second, but20500:35:32.970 --> 00:35:51.180Courtney Karnes: harnessing the power of community and movements, and then that through line, and I don't know where purpose sits, but it is kind of that through line of everything we do, and we know that we get the best results in life when we're tapped into something that is our actual purpose, and knowing that gives our life meaning.20600:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.000Courtney Karnes: So20700:35:53.730 --> 00:36:05.419Courtney Karnes: I like Jen Sanchero, who you probably hate her book. But I single handedly mocked it at the airport, then read it forever, because I liked how simple her framework was, which was. Can you see this? By the way, does it need to be bigger.20800:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.350The Alliance: Yeah, totally. I'm good. I'm good. I'm I'm with you.20900:36:07.350 --> 00:36:24.420Courtney Karnes: But the idea behind, you know, live on a freight train of fuck. Yeah, I like the highs, and I like to live a life that has like high frequency, energy, and I want those around me to do that. So whatever that means for you, let's untap it so for me on the left here. Kind of a start.21000:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.229The Alliance: At some point. We're gonna discuss how you stay out of jail, but keep going.21100:36:28.800 --> 00:36:50.299Courtney Karnes: Charm, I think, is going to be charm. Okay? So for growth and potential, it's developed systems, frameworks and methodologies that tap into and optimize potential for the collective and the individual. And for me that that balance between the individual and the collective is like the symbiosis. That's the secret sauce of how to advance21200:36:50.370 --> 00:37:03.449Courtney Karnes: kind of the important elements of this work, because what's good for the collective sometimes is not good for the individual, and what's good for the individual sometimes is not good for the collective. So how do you create kind of that sweet balance between the 2?21300:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.310Courtney Karnes: And then from a community and movement perspective. It's connect with and elevate21400:37:08.580 --> 00:37:18.680Courtney Karnes: people period like harness and mobilize the power of the collective to radically shift culture and elevate human experience. That's kind of the beating thought behind this.21500:37:18.780 --> 00:37:26.089Courtney Karnes: and then purpose is leverage the power of purpose, like, I said, to really be the driver behind all of these activities.21600:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.439Courtney Karnes: And so21700:37:27.740 --> 00:37:37.989Courtney Karnes: let me just pause because I've said a lot like what's hitting you with this, and you can obviously be as honest as possible because I don't want to waste my time on stuff that's going to be circular or21800:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.490Courtney Karnes: keep me spinning.21900:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.100The Alliance: So22000:37:45.310 --> 00:37:49.270The Alliance: I think 3 things, I think.22100:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.100The Alliance: even go back to slide 2 for a sec. Let's let's let's roll back for a second.22200:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.080Courtney Karnes: That's fine!22300:37:58.200 --> 00:37:58.870The Alliance: Yeah.22400:37:58.990 --> 00:38:05.500The Alliance: So I like all of this. And I think.22500:38:05.920 --> 00:38:16.270The Alliance: Wow, this is way too vague to be useful for your brain. I don't like thriving22600:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.370The Alliance: means a very specific thing to Courtney.22700:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.909The Alliance: And so what is like, I wanna know, what is that term? First.st22800:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.420Courtney Karnes: Hmm.22900:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.830The Alliance: Age of automation, like.23000:38:30.540 --> 00:38:39.430The Alliance: 1st of all, that's an ongoing thing. What do you mean by age of like just I. Just, I want as many specifics as possible under these terms.23100:38:39.680 --> 00:38:58.480The Alliance: if for no other reason than the brain needs as much specific as possible to do its magic. So you're limiting what your subconscious can do for you by not really defining terms, slowing down, defining terms. So even second thing, objective leverage, every ounce of my personal potential. Well.23200:38:59.040 --> 00:39:06.450The Alliance: that's not exactly what you mean, because there's things you're not going to do morally, ethically.23300:39:06.790 --> 00:39:16.864The Alliance: because you're not wired that like, what does like? What does that actually mean to advance my purpose? What does that act like? We help discovered and live out theirs?23400:39:17.200 --> 00:39:37.420The Alliance: What does discover and live out actually mean? At what point is your intervention done? Are you coaching? Are you consulting? Are you igniting? Are you teaching from above? What's the altitude here? What feels good as a place to start. Where might you end up? So that, like my problem with this is.23500:39:37.580 --> 00:39:47.810The Alliance: it's fine. But there's a lot of undefined terms that some of these may get later in the deck. So that was the other. That was this other thing. You might have done this, and I just don't know.23600:39:47.810 --> 00:39:48.550Courtney Karnes: Not yet.23700:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.900Courtney Karnes: No, I'm I'm struggling through this process to like. Put something down.23800:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.290The Alliance: The other thing. So the other thing that I'm gonna23900:39:56.290 --> 00:40:01.950The Alliance: I'm gonna do for you do in about24000:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.899The Alliance: a little. Well, a little while. So my.24100:40:08.080 --> 00:40:15.796The Alliance: I'm gonna let you read in a very, very advanced not like it's not even through the publisher yet. Copy of my new book with Peter.24200:40:16.580 --> 00:40:23.347The Alliance: because it really talks about purpose in the age of AI like we like, and so24300:40:25.570 --> 00:40:43.869The Alliance: it will help you fill in the details around sort of that portion of the mission. There's a lot of like there's a lot of I don't give you at least my science thinking, and and some and some stuff. Right? It'll help you fill in some of those details if you want. It's up to you. But I do. Okay. That could. That could happen.24400:40:44.860 --> 00:40:51.417The Alliance: I can also. I also want I didn't do this, but before, but I I will do it now.24500:40:51.820 --> 00:41:11.569The Alliance: I just put you on the phone, my friends, Krista Stryker, I told you she sort of built a Passion Institute so she could sort of do what you're trying to do with purpose, with passion. I'm not saying this is the right way, but this is sort of how she approached it. The way I approach flow like, how would I? How would you study it? How would you become an expert at it? What would that really take?24600:41:11.650 --> 00:41:22.303The Alliance: And so that's how she's going at it. I just want you to talk to her so you can get a framework of somebody who's thought long and hard about this. She's a she's a pretty smart woman.24700:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.457The Alliance: Oh, I will! I will do that24800:41:27.980 --> 00:41:35.370The Alliance: cause that'll be fun. You guys will like each other also. And I opt24900:41:35.700 --> 00:41:55.089The Alliance: keep going, because, like, that's, that's same comment on every one of these. I look at each slide, and I think these are terms that are not yet defined. Community and movement is like a big thing, and I think to myself, like I have a really good friend who is one of the 3 principles in black lives matter.25000:41:55.506 --> 00:42:05.607The Alliance: and she's no longer really agrees, like you know what I say. And she didn't want it to define her life, and it took over her like, you know what I mean like?25100:42:06.615 --> 00:42:29.529The Alliance: I've got another friend, Jack, whose place we're gonna be at. And so who started the Stop Asian hate movement, and I think he loved it. You know what I mean. So like I've seen it work both ways. And I'm not saying bad, I'm saying. That's our huge fucking container. Those are huge, fucking words and cool like great. But what does that actually mean? And what does that actually mean for you.25200:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.070Courtney Karnes: I know.25300:42:30.470 --> 00:42:47.079The Alliance: Right and and the but here's the here's the thing that here's your job. Your job is to go. What does this mean for me, or even better, I don't know what community movements mean for me. So what are the 3 experiments that I could run to figure out25400:42:47.080 --> 00:43:05.840The Alliance: like what community? How like, what do I like? What size, what size room am I best in? What's the like? How? What is it like all those stuff? So I'm not saying bad, and I'm not saying you even have to define them. I have to say, well, what what experiments could you run to figure out like, what's your sweet spot in this process, so that you could build something25500:43:05.840 --> 00:43:14.069The Alliance: that fits you because you were right. You don't want to compromise. This is like one of the great lessons that I learned very early on in my marriage for my wife.25600:43:14.428 --> 00:43:17.810The Alliance: And it was a funny argument, but I was like.25700:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.740The Alliance: I had25800:43:20.800 --> 00:43:45.610The Alliance: started smoking again, and I was going to be with my parents, and I was trying to figure out how to hide the smoking from my parents, and she started screaming at me. My wife, just like lost her shit was just like, no like you are. You like you can't like they can't love you for you. If you keep high, like all that stuff, you gotta be able to blah blah! And it was one of the like. She screamed so mad at me, and she was so right.25900:43:46.360 --> 00:43:52.580The Alliance: It was really right. It's 1 of the reasons that, like I don't hide my smoking from all my clients like26000:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.159The Alliance: you get me all my, all my addictions.26100:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.850Courtney Karnes: Yeah, I think that that I mean.26200:44:00.630 --> 00:44:05.689Courtney Karnes: I also have seen the thing that I I can stop sharing. I mean, I I didn't go26300:44:06.230 --> 00:44:10.469Courtney Karnes: deeper than this, and we can talk about it in a second. But just to like put.26400:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.099The Alliance: Would you go a couple of slides down so I could see where we go?26500:44:13.100 --> 00:44:30.159Courtney Karnes: Well, no, I didn't. This is like my brain working. So then I go into further detail to say, like, what are the actual goals here at Auric like, how does this map to growth and potential? Because I want to know every day that when I show up and do work here that it's not disconnected from this bigger like.26600:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.600The Alliance: Good.26700:44:30.600 --> 00:44:38.430Courtney Karnes: Deep thought right? And I want it to kind of build towards some type of scorecard, because I've told you before that the the.26800:44:38.750 --> 00:44:44.629Courtney Karnes: the the beauty and the risk of being a generalist is the beauty is that you're.26900:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.380The Alliance: Wait, stop! Stop!27000:44:46.580 --> 00:44:52.489The Alliance: Stop! Time out! This is a fucking, really crazy ass! 1st step.27100:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.020The Alliance: What is?27200:44:54.760 --> 00:44:59.119The Alliance: What would a purpose driven life, Scorecard27300:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.239The Alliance: look like if you were to make a scorecard that.27400:45:02.240 --> 00:45:02.670Courtney Karnes: You know.27500:45:02.670 --> 00:45:11.719The Alliance: Giving the gift to people. What would what would that scorecard look like? What are the I mean? I love this because I'm always like, well, what are the? It's not just like, what are the Kpi I like.27600:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.130Courtney Karnes: Yeah.27700:45:12.130 --> 00:45:17.530The Alliance: Metrics, that matter. What's the dashboard that allows me to run my company? My life.27800:45:17.530 --> 00:45:18.090Courtney Karnes: Yes.27900:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.580The Alliance: In a glance right.28000:45:20.490 --> 00:45:33.290Courtney Karnes: The actually, Stephen, like the truth is that at the at a glance, living and tapping into where does my time, energy, and effort go like, what is the? And I just built this for work? Actually, I would.28100:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.310Courtney Karnes: Which is a scorecard on28200:45:35.720 --> 00:45:57.920Courtney Karnes: how well are we engaging with our clients? What are the key areas of criteria? Is it? Blah, blah? And then each it's a red, yellow, green. And then you can look across the entirety of the portfolio and say, like, here's our areas of risk. It's very simple. But it's also like revolutionary here. And the simplicity is the revolution, I think, and in a world of so much complexity.28300:45:57.920 --> 00:46:15.600Courtney Karnes: The idea of a scorecard going back here like, I believe that that scorecard is a piece of the secret sauce. I think the inflection point mapping, knowing where you are versus where you're going, and what are the pieces along the way? What are the moments of transition in life, and the catalyst that kind of28400:46:15.600 --> 00:46:28.149Courtney Karnes: anyway, like that's the work that that interests me. But I'm just trying to like put a framing around it so that it all makes sense with time, energy, and effort, and I agree with you on that is like.28500:46:28.770 --> 00:46:34.989Courtney Karnes: I think the simplicity of the measurement of these things is very important, and, like a human, an index28600:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.409Courtney Karnes: creating an index.28700:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.349The Alliance: This may not be a good idea.28800:46:45.810 --> 00:46:53.530The Alliance: and let me see if I can get it out. It strikes me that you have, or28900:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.830The Alliance: essential categories. The last one is a little hazy to me, but 1st is.29000:47:00.150 --> 00:47:06.280The Alliance: you have a category of need in that you need to skill yourself up deeply in the science of purpose.29100:47:07.467 --> 00:47:33.310The Alliance: And the cultural purpose like from every angle. So, for example, I was writing on purpose yesterday, and I was working with Chat Gbt. And I was like, what am I missing? And I was writing about purpose and empathy and collaboration? I was like, what am I missing, and it was like you're missing trauma. And how cultural trauma blocks. And I was like, Oh, my God, it's so fucking like. Of course I'm missing like, it's right there. Thank you. You know what I mean. So like.29200:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.629The Alliance: I wanna know, like, I want you to29300:47:36.770 --> 00:47:44.679The Alliance: get really clear on purpose, because, like, before you can even get to the scorecard. Let's say the scorecard frameworks slash scorecard29400:47:45.220 --> 00:48:09.850The Alliance: 4 months from now is a kind of a cool goal like that might be like we. I see how that could happen, or at least that a process that gets you there one is. There's a whole shit ton of stuff about purpose. I don't know what you know and don't know. My book is probably a starting point for a lot of the thinking there's probably other stuff out there. That I can recommend if you want29500:48:10.566 --> 00:48:21.640The Alliance: but I see the science of purpose, science, or whatever you want to call it history of purpose, and you can learn about purpose in the world. Is useful. It's also a modern idea.29600:48:21.900 --> 00:48:34.659The Alliance: Remember that when it was survival of the fittest purpose was fuck. I gotta stay alive. Right? New idea. So there was an invention of purpose. And why did that happen? These are just interesting fodder for your brain29700:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.199The Alliance: category. 2 are29800:48:38.670 --> 00:48:49.090The Alliance: systems systems that you're seeing in work, that you want to find a way to sort of import into people's lives to help them live on purpose.29900:48:49.090 --> 00:49:14.415The Alliance: Right? So what you essentially need is a tool is a list of all the possibles and a tool assessment, a way to sort of pick and choose. Figure out if you've got what you want, or if there's something you're missing, and then skill up in it and make sure those tools are right right, and I believe wholeheartedly, that as you learn about purpose, and as you skill up on tools a little bit, though I think he's got the tools kind of down.30000:49:14.710 --> 00:49:20.459The Alliance: your brain will pattern you like. It'll do that. The next category is30100:49:20.670 --> 00:49:36.549The Alliance: the Courtney category. It's what are you like? What like, you've got high level community all these things, you where where you have invisible skills. But you're not really down into what it is that you want to do like? When I got to the Alliance.30200:49:36.820 --> 00:49:49.140The Alliance: you know how many fucking like we had a hundred personal lines. That was, we did that version. We had one on one coaching, I mean, like I did everything you could possibly imagine in between, and tested every combination until I was like30300:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.889The Alliance: what is going to challenge me30400:49:52.160 --> 00:50:00.680The Alliance: and fire me up every time I was like 15 coaching calls a month is gonna kill me. So those people better be fucking awesome, because if30500:50:01.410 --> 00:50:07.029The Alliance: I'm helping them and they're helping me, this is sustainable. If it's not, I'm fucked.30600:50:07.080 --> 00:50:33.600The Alliance: Then, like I'm just mad at you people for taking my time, and I'm a shitty coach, and I've just stolen your money so. And that's not integrity so like those kinds of like, what is the perfect Courtney fit? Where are my invisible steals? What are my strengths? What's the perfect fit? So there's a Courtney very specific category. So you're gonna end up with a really good map of passion. Really good map of the tools, and a really good map of yourself, which is basically, how do I want to apply these tools in the world.30700:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.080Courtney Karnes: Hmm.30800:50:34.080 --> 00:50:40.929The Alliance: Right, and then the 4th category is the rollout plan30900:50:41.290 --> 00:51:05.640The Alliance: right like whatever whatever that is. But I honestly think if you can get these 3 steps done. That's gonna start like it's gonna be. It's gonna naturally emerge from the what we learn about passion, the frameworks themselves, and what you learn about yourself. The rollout plan like that to me is what work is gonna what? That's what you're gonna see if you fill in those 3 categories, I think. Does that make sense to you?31000:51:05.790 --> 00:51:28.230Courtney Karnes: Yeah, that makes sense to me. How would you say, Steve? I mean, I heard you say, like, define the terms and what I've created. But what I really want is to to narrow my time, energy, and effort to get specific. And what you kind of quote prescribed is passion tools, self, and a the 4th distant is the rollout plan, which I really like.31100:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.830The Alliance: Yeah, I just yeah, I would just focus on the 1st 3, right?31200:51:31.830 --> 00:51:41.179Courtney Karnes: Fit within what I've built. Would you say? Like, sure, that's a framework. But this is more of like a like a sprint or area of focus that I would run to kind of see what pops.31300:51:41.180 --> 00:51:49.690The Alliance: Oh, yeah, this is a this is a sprint. You're running for 2 months, maybe like the not even 2 months. I'd like to see knowing you. You're gonna be through this in a month.31400:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.030The Alliance: You'll call31500:51:50.030 --> 00:52:02.659The Alliance: back and you'll be like, okay, I read, I read 10 books and 5 articles, and they listen to a bunch of lectures. I've got a full tool list that has been thoroughly audited by AI 6 times and backwards, and then I've got a complete, a much31600:52:02.790 --> 00:52:12.929The Alliance: bigger map of like exactly how I want to work in the world like I think you're, gonna I think you're 6 weeks would be my guess if you do it with incubation periods.31700:52:13.704 --> 00:52:33.160The Alliance: The thing you're going to want to do that you're you don't want to use Chat Gbt for all the time is finding the connections. You actually just want to give yourself the space to find those connections. And then, like, you know, when 3 or 4 things start connecting the other. And you're really lit up. Okay, now like that. Right now, you got something.31800:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.389Courtney Karnes: Yeah, yeah, that's good. Thank you.31900:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.900Courtney Karnes: I like this.32000:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.680The Alliance: This is just a this is just a I don't think I think you're trying to build a pot. So32100:52:43.340 --> 00:52:50.569The Alliance: when I write I have 3 errors. We're gonna talk about feedback next month. But we're gonna talk about. I call the minimal feedback for flow.32200:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.530The Alliance: So32300:52:52.060 --> 00:53:10.300The Alliance: you have to figure out this what this is for yourself, but for me when I and this is this is the same fuck up anywhere, speech, course, whatever. It's the same errors. And so my editor, who reads my stuff twice a week, is on my payroll, he reads, for is it boring? Is it arrogant, or is it confusing? If it's32400:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.250The Alliance: boring.32500:53:13.460 --> 00:53:24.949The Alliance: meaning, it's wandering all over the places. I don't know my starts and my endings right. I don't know where I'm starting from, where I'm going. If it's arrogant meaning I'm using. Lots of fancy words haven't done enough research.32600:53:25.130 --> 00:53:37.820The Alliance: I don't yet know what I'm talking about. So my fancy words and my general vague words. Your slide deck right now is, I don't want to say it's arrogant, but I would call it arrogant in my category. You've got big fancy words32700:53:37.820 --> 00:54:01.600The Alliance: like community like movement like right? Those are big. Those are actually, very, very specific things. And the 3rd one, arrogant, confusing is, I, you know. Don't. Oh, it's boring, is. I haven't found my style. I haven't found my my path. And confusing is I don't know my starts and endings, and these tend to be the things that people screw up on their big projects right?32800:54:01.600 --> 00:54:09.959The Alliance: And usually so with really smart people who have very fast brains and are high energy, myself included.32900:54:10.370 --> 00:54:25.030The Alliance: We often the arrogant thing is where we screw up because we sort of know what we mean by terms like collective and movement, and like, we only discover we really don't. When we, when we're actually talking to dumb people.33000:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.749Courtney Karnes: Yeah, and we're.33100:54:25.750 --> 00:54:36.910The Alliance: Like trying to explain this at a bar or on an airplane to the person next to us. And they're like asking us those like, you know, 2 year old questions. And then you're like, Oh, shit! I'm covering33200:54:37.100 --> 00:54:51.580The Alliance: I I haven't actually defined this. I'm covering for myself. And usually so here's the what's sneaky about this. This is the sneakiest part. This is the danger with AI same issue, the free energy principle. The brain's an efficiency engine. So if it can get away with not doing the work.33300:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.070The Alliance: it's going to33400:54:53.120 --> 00:55:11.060The Alliance: it, will not? You won't notice that you're using big fancy words. You think you're writing straight out of your soul, and it really vibes with you. Your brain is hiding the fact that you have way more work to do from you because it wants to be lazy. And it's a problem with33500:55:11.060 --> 00:55:31.789The Alliance: impatient, super, smart people, because we get over our brains, move so fast we get over. And this is one way we sort of trick ourselves. And you actually need to drill down into those things, because that's like by forcing yourself to find those terms and define those terms and define your role in those terms. That's really where you're leveraged. That's those are your answers.33600:55:32.610 --> 00:55:42.013Courtney Karnes: That's my special version of hell to like. Have to slow down and define every little thing but I and I hear what you're saying.33700:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.920The Alliance: 2 years the term, though.33800:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.579Courtney Karnes: Piece. The covering piece is real to be, I mean, that's.33900:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.789The Alliance: You really. Wanna you wanna be playful with it. So like, let's take your mission state that 1st page, 1st line.34000:55:51.790 --> 00:55:52.430Courtney Karnes: Yeah.34100:55:52.430 --> 00:55:55.450The Alliance: I would tell you to find one term a day34200:55:57.110 --> 00:56:11.989The Alliance: until you're through it right like, start working your way through the early portion of the slide deck and just define one term a day. Don't try to do it all. Because if you try to do this, get this done, you're not gonna learn what you need to learn about yourself.34300:56:13.520 --> 00:56:28.789The Alliance: So this is one of these like little bits at a time. You know, this is a war. You in one time, and it'll be exponential like it'll be a little bit a little bit, a little bit. All of a sudden things are gonna start clicking together, and then you're gonna get that super deep flow state feeling.34400:56:29.080 --> 00:56:57.949Courtney Karnes: Yeah, okay, I like that. I've been meaning to tell you that my favorite line from your art of the impossible book is the backboard shattering Thunder Dunk, and it's also mixed with the person who reads the book for you. That book in particular, his. If you want to talk about someone sliding down a mountain of butter on a hot plate. That guy's voice does it? But that phrase I love, and I think there's a few places in your your book that have34500:57:00.780 --> 00:57:09.449Courtney Karnes: like the magic of simplicity, but very vivid at the same time, and to do to translate, and that into this conversation, not to be a 1 off, but like34600:57:10.980 --> 00:57:17.329Courtney Karnes: the beauty of pausing on the things that deserve the pause to make them pop and explain them.34700:57:17.710 --> 00:57:32.930Courtney Karnes: Just a touch. You know just enough so that your listener comes along, and I know that I don't often have the patience to do it, nor do I take the time to do it, because I'm so quickly trying to get to the next thing to your point. So that resonated.34800:57:33.130 --> 00:57:46.459The Alliance: Here's the here's 1 of the reasons. So I've learned 2 things writing a book, and I think it's just true in teaching. So the the most distressing thing that an author learns writing a book is you never write the book you want to write34900:57:46.610 --> 00:57:52.299The Alliance: about the topic you want to write about. You actually have to write the book before the book you want to write, because you have to tell people all this.35000:57:52.300 --> 00:57:52.760Courtney Karnes: It depends.35100:57:52.760 --> 00:58:01.929The Alliance: Learned. Get to the book right? We're always fascinated by the cutting edge shit. That's on the edge of our brain because we're learning it now, and it's got lots of dopamine.35200:58:01.930 --> 00:58:26.470The Alliance: But unless you tell the listener, reader, audience, whatever how you got there, they can't come along with you for the ride that you lock your excitement locks them out. It doesn't invite them in is part of that. And the reason I go so slowly, one. I love the simplicity. I like it to me like I have a rule from journalism which I've learned to live by, which is, if you're using a lot of35300:58:26.470 --> 00:58:29.720The Alliance: big words to explain something to me. You're lying35400:58:30.950 --> 00:58:56.890The Alliance: flat out like as far as that's my I live by that rule, and I use it like it's how I determine if I can work with you. But like there's a lot of stuff. So I'm and it sometimes you're not lying intentionally. Sometimes you're lying to yourself. You don't actually know what you're talking about. So I'll get. You know, there's a there's somebody in our group who has a really really big idea about physics whose views is a lot of very big words to describe it. Still, he doesn't yet know his idea.35500:58:56.890 --> 00:58:57.420Courtney Karnes: Hmm.35600:58:57.420 --> 00:59:14.330The Alliance: So right like as a journalist. If I got into that situation I was interviewing, said Person, I would I would. My! All my alarm bells would go off. I'd be like, I walk away from the story. This is a dangerous story. This person is gonna lie to you and they won't. They probably won't even know they're lying and they'll exaggerate.35700:59:14.450 --> 00:59:27.889The Alliance: not because they're trying to exaggerate, but they're trying to make a coherent story in their head for you, and they don't yet know what they're talking about, and you have to be really careful. As a as a journalist, as a you know, as a business person, like all that stuff. Or this is the problem with dopamine and big ideas.35800:59:28.300 --> 00:59:28.825The Alliance: But35900:59:29.350 --> 00:59:41.562Courtney Karnes: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So I have my, I know we're coming up on time. I want to be respectful of that. I have my assignment at least to kind of spend the next 6 weeks digging into passion, tools, and self.36000:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.780Courtney Karnes: which I like.36100:59:44.230 --> 00:59:51.640Courtney Karnes: What what else do I need to know? Or is there any feedback from you on this journey thus far? What! Just36200:59:52.050 --> 00:59:53.689Courtney Karnes: help me help me.36300:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.270The Alliance: Oh.36401:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.923The Alliance: so one36501:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.559The Alliance: I don't know if this is useful or not.36601:00:09.310 --> 01:00:12.730The Alliance: but I'm really not worried about you.36701:00:14.600 --> 01:00:14.960Courtney Karnes: Chat.36801:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.990The Alliance: Really like like when I say, really not worried about you.36901:00:18.230 --> 01:00:24.259The Alliance: I will. I'll be in the beginning of this call as you were talking and pick and talking. All I was thinking to myself, is.37001:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.919The Alliance: man. I'd like to work with this woman. That was what my brain did. I was like.37101:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.350Courtney Karnes: Dang!37201:00:29.350 --> 01:00:36.429The Alliance: Then I went. Well, wait a minute. What you've got. The lions like you are actually where you were. There in 2 like that was the point in 3 like.37301:00:36.990 --> 01:00:46.079The Alliance: if you just had that, then I don't want. I don't ever have that reaction I want to work with like I'm terrified of other people to work with. It means more shit in my life, like.37401:00:46.080 --> 01:00:46.430Courtney Karnes: Yeah.37501:00:46.430 --> 01:01:02.089The Alliance: Like. I'm scared of that impulse. So I've learned to distrust that impulse. But so like that doesn't come out of nowhere for me. Usually that I'm like, I do what you do. I'm really great. It's 1 of the reasons I'm good at my job. I'm really a good talent spotter.37601:01:02.610 --> 01:01:03.190Courtney Karnes: Hmm.37701:01:03.973 --> 01:01:04.586The Alliance: And37801:01:05.530 --> 01:01:27.720The Alliance: and in terms of like, when I say talents butter, I'm really good at figuring out there are 2 kinds of people who can go after big dreams in the world. There are the people who actually understand that you can go after the biggest dreams in the world, but they're a checklist, and if you can't, if you don't have the patience in the brain to figure out the 1,000 things on the checklist, you cannot. You don't get your big dream like you just don't. And that's the like.37901:01:27.720 --> 01:01:44.069The Alliance: There's a bunch of people where the challenges they don't like. They don't you see that, like you already know how to operation. I'm not like I'm not. I'm not worried about about that like I don't. I don't see gaps in your game. I your recovery game seems pretty.38001:01:45.970 --> 01:01:46.480The Alliance: is it?38101:01:46.480 --> 01:01:46.880The Alliance: Week.38201:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.390Courtney Karnes: Is it.38301:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.850The Alliance: Week.38401:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.260The Alliance: I don't have a lot of38501:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.539The Alliance: are you? Let me ask you the basics? Are you sleeping 7, 8 HA night?38601:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.999Courtney Karnes: Yeah. I'm big on sleep.38701:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.520The Alliance: Okay, you, getting regular exercise.38801:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.980Courtney Karnes: Regular exercise.38901:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.950The Alliance: You're doing daily meditation to reset your nervous system.39001:02:02.950 --> 01:02:05.770Courtney Karnes: With Joe Dispenza and with your Mp. The M.39101:02:05.770 --> 01:02:09.099Courtney Karnes: Either. Or do you have a daily gratitude practice?39201:02:09.100 --> 01:02:16.540Courtney Karnes: Yeah, now I'm writing my, I feel grateful regularly. But now I'm writing my things at the end of the day because it's on the checklist you gave me. I'm doing it.39301:02:16.540 --> 01:02:23.357The Alliance: It's good, it's it's a really good, by the way, it's a good strength finder, too. You start like one of the things that make visible.39401:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.410The Alliance: your complete concentration, game, distraction, management. How are you.39501:02:28.410 --> 01:02:41.229Courtney Karnes: On it. And that feels because I've given my concentration to so many other people without them asking for so long. I like to fix other people's problems and not my own. So now that I'm focused, I feel like39601:02:41.990 --> 01:02:46.150Courtney Karnes: some, and meditating like that piece, and the lock in feels.39701:02:46.150 --> 01:02:54.179The Alliance: So what are what are the distraction? This is one. Where do what's 1 of the distraction management? Things that we can try to import this month.39801:02:54.810 --> 01:02:55.470Courtney Karnes: Hmm.39901:02:55.470 --> 01:03:00.800The Alliance: That you're not that, that we're we're to 5. And and what would happen if we could get it to an 8.40001:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.449Courtney Karnes: You know what it is, Steven. I think it's like40101:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.109Courtney Karnes: it goes back to the finding the place for things.40201:03:08.240 --> 01:03:35.169Courtney Karnes: That is really what I need to work on. Because if I'm constantly trying to decide, is it worth my time, energy, and effort? I have always spent my career boiling the ocean. That's why I'm good, because I can like generally apply my skill to solve a bunch of different problems and add value to a bunch of different people, but it robs me. And now I'm like, what if I hone in on like? I know that some of this stuff just happens in my sleep? I'm naturally good at it, but not having a place to map40301:03:35.170 --> 01:03:47.959Courtney Karnes: my actions back to a bigger goal, I'm big on vision, and if the thing I'm doing isn't attached to a bigger vision for me. Then I flail, and I spend a lot of energetic time trying to place it. I don't know.40401:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.370The Alliance: Yeah, I I mean, I think that. So I here40501:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.580The Alliance: my, let me pause there for a second, because40601:03:53.730 --> 01:04:08.647The Alliance: maybe this is helpful. I feel like the exercise we're running right now is gonna get you to a framework. Your frame like you're you have your mission. Your Mtp. Needs a little bit of clarity, so your brain can work with it. But you've got your mission like bind right?40701:04:10.220 --> 01:04:28.747The Alliance: The next question is, what are the high, hard goals, right? What is 10 years actually look like, what do you like? I've given myself 10 years. Okay, cool. Maybe we're not gonna get 10 years at the end of 4 months, but maybe we could get a 5 year. What's the 5 year, or the 2 year like any of those things would be kind of cool.40801:04:29.020 --> 01:04:29.570Courtney Karnes: Yeah.40901:04:30.208 --> 01:04:43.589The Alliance: I don't necessarily know. That's a distraction problem. But I will say that what I what what it strikes me as with this group is that this is incredibly true is the biggest distraction most people have is they've got really good.41001:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.510The Alliance: Okay? Pretty good daily habits, really good missions.41101:04:47.980 --> 01:05:14.824The Alliance: And really vague, high, hard goals that are not fully actionized in terms of the reality of what that goal actually means. And what does your life look like once you get it. And are you sure that's the life you want? And like all those questions, have to be really asked to get this right? I and I. So I feel like you're this. This goal stuff is for you is going to be very much distraction management, because it'll clean up. Okay.41201:05:15.490 --> 01:05:21.890The Alliance: You've got recovery got distraction management. You're definitely challenging yourself every day. I can see it in your face.41301:05:21.890 --> 01:05:22.149Courtney Karnes: Yeah.41401:05:22.691 --> 01:05:30.020The Alliance: I'm not worried about that particular one. I'd like to, you know. I want you to dial it back a little bit. Yeah. The the.41501:05:30.500 --> 01:05:36.920The Alliance: I got a weird ass suggestion for you, which is, you might41601:05:37.410 --> 01:05:42.840The Alliance: really oddly benefit from like a 15 min walk in nature.41701:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.040Courtney Karnes: Hmm.41801:05:44.040 --> 01:05:50.500The Alliance: Not just access, just like a walk, like it's a 20 min, you know, it's really good for a lot of things. It's a great41901:05:51.651 --> 01:06:05.478The Alliance: release activity. All the great philosophers used it. They were all walking. I don't know if you know this. There's a huge tradition in philosophy called the walking philosophers, Emerson Nietzsche. They all walked they put themselves into low grade flow states.42001:06:08.110 --> 01:06:15.619The Alliance: I wanna tell you one last thing because it's funny. And then and then we'll wrap because I want to be respectful of your time. You gave me 5 extra minutes.42101:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.200Courtney Karnes: No, I'm grateful for it. I have a question for you at the end, but I want to.42201:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.120The Alliance: Okay, cool this. This is just so.42301:06:21.850 --> 01:06:32.849The Alliance: When I met my wife I met my wife. I broke up with a girl, a woman I was dating who I liked broke up with me, and I was single, for like I was like, Huh!42401:06:33.060 --> 01:06:46.690The Alliance: I'll use dating apps. I've never used dating apps, and I had 10 dates in a row, where each date was literally crazier than the last, like the 1st one was like a woman who, like in the middle of appetizers. I've just met her42501:06:46.780 --> 01:07:12.159The Alliance: start sobbing and screaming. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm a lesbian. I can't do this. This is like date one date 2. It's like a Tuesday at 6 o'clock, and she can't stop running to the bathroom bumping rails like she's putting so much fucking coke up her nose. I literally don't know what to do. This is day 2, and it just goes from there. So at the end of all of it I was like, and the worst of it was.42601:07:12.950 --> 01:07:20.990The Alliance: I had been single a long time. I was single, for, like 37 years I had some long relationships, but I was single for and and I would date.42701:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.620The Alliance: And so like I would usually know by like42801:07:24.760 --> 01:07:38.960The Alliance: 2 min of the conversation like I knew where the relationship was going. I knew what the sex was like. I knew what you look like with your clothes off. I knew what problems we were gonna have I knew what? And you probably knew that about me. But I like clear like I saw it like 2 min of the conversation. I kept seeing it, and I was like42901:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.190The Alliance: after day. 10. I was like.43001:07:41.320 --> 01:07:58.140The Alliance: you know, what my life has been totally predictable, and I'm done like. I can see it coming, and I'm done. I refuse. And I was like, and I and I kept running to this weird problem where I was like every woman who I actually started dating they all had. They all had43101:07:58.520 --> 01:08:22.749The Alliance: hero, daddy stuff because I was attracting this kind of woman, and if you have attract that kind of woman the minute you show vulnerability or error they leave like if they like. Daddy's a hero. You can't be broken, or you're or you're they're gone. And this kept happening to me. And I was like, I gotta start attracting a different kind of woman, or I'm into the same fucking circle, and I don't know how to. I don't know what I'm doing like, so I'm going to. Literally.43201:08:22.750 --> 01:08:49.750The Alliance: I refuse to touch the next woman I'm interested in until she knows every single thing that's wrong with me. I like I don't care how long it takes like if it takes 6 months. So the next person I met was my wife, and it was it was perfect because a she was married at the time, and she they were separated, but they were getting divorced, and I was like, I won't mess with like, it's not what I wanted to do, so like you have to be completely divorced. Otherwise we're not going to get involved in a sexual relationship. And it took so long that, like I,43301:08:49.750 --> 01:09:02.829The Alliance: you know, and I'm 22 years later, we're still together. But literally, I was like, I'm so fucking sick of going in circles with women that I've got it like everything I could do to do it differently. I like I wore different clothes on dates, everything changed everything I could.43401:09:03.300 --> 01:09:10.740Courtney Karnes: This is a case study and a reality show God. I wish these things were like to see you on dating apps, and then navigating blind.43501:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.019The Alliance: It was one of the most.43601:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.670Courtney Karnes: One of the more.43701:09:12.670 --> 01:09:33.850The Alliance: I like it would, because the other thing is, when, like somebody breaks down in the middle of appetizers, a lesbian like it's like I've got a part. I've got a reporter's brain so I can literally unplug and like, watch it on this screen. I don't care what it is like, so there's a big part of me that is like trying not to like fall down laughing because it's the funniest thing I've ever fucking seen.43801:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.489Courtney Karnes: I love it. That's your.43901:09:35.490 --> 01:09:36.559The Alliance: Anyways, you had a question.44001:09:36.569 --> 01:09:45.899Courtney Karnes: Yeah. Yeah. Well, one, I want to correct something that I said in our 1st meeting, which was you asked me, do you want to build it yourself and like, go at it, solo. Or do you want to work with other people?44101:09:46.167 --> 01:09:49.109The Alliance: This is my question for you, too. Okay, answers, keep going.44201:09:49.109 --> 01:10:18.419Courtney Karnes: Okay. So, but my answer is, I don't need to build it myself. I want to build. I want to do something that's in alignment with my integrity and my values, but I think the beauty of it is working at it. Oh, my God! That your your polar bear that just passed by. How cute! I want to do something that that moves the needle on, what I care about, and I think it's most likely done with people, and that's where I get energized is with people who are kind of operating in similar, you know, frequencies. As I am. So I correct what I said before. That's 1.44301:10:18.629 --> 01:10:20.299Courtney Karnes: Did you have something? Because I'm going to.44401:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.429The Alliance: Yeah, let me. So here's my question. Comment44501:10:23.060 --> 01:10:45.660The Alliance: that there are. I can think of 2 other people that I've been on a call with who are sort of trying to do something similar. Right? They have different angles on it. Cooperation leaders like whatever. But there's like 3 people in the group who are all like, I like business. I like that world. I want to sort of do this this way, that way. And44601:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.190The Alliance: one I keep thinking.44701:10:51.180 --> 01:11:02.830The Alliance: Maybe you want to team up. Maybe you don't. I like it. Maybe the fits aren't there? But I don't know if people want me to play matchmaker or not, because it could be a disaster. Putting people together to work together. If it's not right, is a total.44801:11:02.830 --> 01:11:03.160Courtney Karnes: Yeah.44901:11:03.160 --> 01:11:26.560The Alliance: Disaster. But I will say there's a bunch of people in the group. We're wrestling with their version of this these kinds of questions. I seem to think you are farther along than some of the other people. There's a couple of people who already have frameworks that they like but, like I I like I so I don't quite know what to do with that one yet. I I didn't wasn't something I anticipated, but I have noticed it.45001:11:26.740 --> 01:11:46.400Courtney Karnes: I mean, you're you're cruising at a higher altitude than the rest of us, and you have the benefit of seeing down and through the group, and where there's strategic connection points. And because our connection as a group is so limited during this 4 month time, like once a month, or what you don't get to get raw like unless you're in person, which I think is significantly.45101:11:46.400 --> 01:11:55.472The Alliance: Yeah, like what I would tell you right now is you, Brian? And I'll I'll mention this tomorrow. People want to put you, Brian, and probably45201:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.340The Alliance: and it's wholly45301:12:01.530 --> 01:12:10.877The Alliance: are all Po. Your Anatoly's coming at it. He's trying. He's buying mid market companies and trying to upgrade them, but he's building an operating system for the upgrade.45401:12:11.310 --> 01:12:13.019The Alliance: doesn't. I don't think he quite45501:12:13.330 --> 01:12:40.160The Alliance: even understands what that means, let alone how to how to do it at a deep level but like he's doing something amazing, which is, Oh, fuck! I'm not gonna try to like sell companies. I ideas. I'm gonna fucking. Buy them and do read it like, that's a cool okay, that's a cool solution to cultural change that like solves a lot of shit. Right? I was like, wow! Nobody's. I've never heard anybody tell me that I was like, huh! Crazy idea!45601:12:40.220 --> 01:12:51.330The Alliance: That's cool. The other stuff you're talking about. You're not yet prepared to do, and I haven't said this to him yet, but I was like I was thinking. Brian, on the other hand, might have a system for you, and you might just want to talk.45701:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.540Courtney Karnes: Bryan's in, that's all I'm thinking45801:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.909Courtney Karnes: right. Brian and I hit it off at dinner. We sat next to each other, and45901:12:56.390 --> 01:13:02.720Courtney Karnes: someone who I'm interested in getting to know. I think it'd be if you drop those with other people, and there's interest. Make that connection.46001:13:02.720 --> 01:13:20.218The Alliance: Yeah, I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna raise it tomorrow in the digital and see like, if anybody doesn't want me to match make Ryan, and I'm happy not to. But otherwise I'm just gonna do it. And I may just like do it in class where I'm like you 3 people should talk like, you know.46101:13:20.510 --> 01:13:21.900Courtney Karnes: I love that. Okay. But.46201:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.160The Alliance: So you had one final question, and then I gotta go.46301:13:24.160 --> 01:13:41.589Courtney Karnes: How I mean we've I know that the nature of this is that we're here to like, advance me and get me blow in, but also like, how can I be helpful to you in this? You know I'm a fan of your work, you know. I've got a good network like I don't know if there's something that I can do to be helpful to you while I'm on this journey with you, but if so.46401:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.660The Alliance: Oh, I appreciate that.46501:13:44.390 --> 01:13:45.045The Alliance: I46601:13:47.200 --> 01:14:09.928The Alliance: So I will probably pick everybody's brain along the way about a couple of different book projects, because you always need allies to get books on the bestsell list, and because I have a new novel out, and I've never solved the novel Pr problem like I've never. I've had novels that have been bestsellers before, but, like all the voodoo doesn't work like, there's like, it's a storytelling problems, or whatever46701:14:10.540 --> 01:14:33.249The Alliance: but I'm trying like that's just a I'd like to. I'd like to. I really want to triumph as a novelist. I think it's the ultimate like I've tried in so many other categories. But like, I really want that that's, you know. And then there's a couple of other things. But the the truth of the matter is like, honest to God. The biggest value I'm getting out of you guys is what I'm already getting, which is like, here's like.46801:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.769The Alliance: Give me an it.46901:14:35.110 --> 01:14:49.219The Alliance: Here's something I learned, and I don't know what to do with this. Okay, so this is like, this is the question I'm faced with right now, which is, I have met with a lot of I met with more than half you, and I've hung out with you at the at the opening event, and47001:14:49.970 --> 01:14:56.879The Alliance: with you with a couple of other people. This is not surprising, because this is where you are in your journey with me, but a lot of these other people have taken lots of my classes and things like that.47101:14:57.410 --> 01:15:04.520The Alliance: What I learned was, yes. Can everybody benefit from creativity, Microdosing, for sure?47201:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.510The Alliance: Did you actually need an hour long lecture on creativity?47301:15:08.700 --> 01:15:22.720The Alliance: Probably not. Did you actually had probably like an hour on goal setting and all the stuff that I keep doing with everybody? Yes, that stuff is really like peak performance, one on one, and one of the reasons I47401:15:23.060 --> 01:15:28.170The Alliance: one. I shy away from it because it's a marketing nightmare, because goal setting is something. Everybody does47501:15:28.820 --> 01:15:49.810The Alliance: so like creativity. Nobody does. It's sexy. It's very steven. But it turns out like, no, everybody's got really sort of specific goal setting issues. And I'm very well suited for them. And it doesn't surprise me. My people dream big, and if you're not trained how to chunk big dreams into action plans.47601:15:50.060 --> 01:16:12.810The Alliance: You flounder. I am trained because a novel is or a book is a big dream, and if you can't chunk it into an action plan. You're fucked same thing with a company. I've started so many companies and written so many books I am really good at. I hard goals like they're not. But and it turns out, Wow, it's a real gap for all these ass kickers.47701:16:12.810 --> 01:16:13.130Courtney Karnes: Yeah.47801:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.780The Alliance: This is so like. Now my question is, do I47901:16:18.900 --> 01:16:44.880The Alliance: in round 2 of this like 1? 1 thing is clear, nobody should have to go through a full day of what you guys went through like. There's gonna be an event the night before we do some of it and introduce ourselves and get to know each other a little bit, and then we'll do a fire hose the next day. That maybe is spread out over a whole day. That is clear, because I saw the look on your face as you were getting into your car. And I saw the look at Sonia's face when I was done talking everybody was like, Oh, I hit them all in the mouth with a baseball bat.48001:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.559The Alliance: It's cool, but maybe it was too big of a bet, and I also.48101:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.649Courtney Karnes: Oh, go ahead! Go ahead!48201:16:50.650 --> 01:16:58.639The Alliance: And so the that the question, those are the questions I'm now starting to ask myself like, it's less fun for me to do goal setting.48301:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.100Courtney Karnes: Hmm.48401:16:59.100 --> 01:17:03.970The Alliance: Than creativity. Because goal setting is sort of really like.48501:17:04.220 --> 01:17:12.889The Alliance: okay, this is how we tie our shoes to me, and I'm good at it. I can really help people. It's not the sex. So like this is the like.48601:17:13.370 --> 01:17:24.850The Alliance: But the flip side is, I'm fucking, loving my group and working with people way more than I thought I would. You know what I mean. And so it's really exciting to be able to actually move the needle for people. And I don't like.48701:17:25.110 --> 01:17:45.360The Alliance: I was really worried. I was, gonna be useful. I was like, Are you gonna suck on these calls, man like, really, could you really actually do this? It was I mentor like 6 different people, and it was my mentores who convinced me they were like, you don't have to do anything. You just show up and do what you do with us. And that's fine. And I was like, Okay, I could. I got that now. But like.48801:17:45.360 --> 01:17:45.740Courtney Karnes: Like.48901:17:45.740 --> 01:18:03.199The Alliance: So I've got like, I'm like this part is going really well, that the actual curriculum training I was like, huh! That's interesting. I don't know what to do with it, so like those are the like, and I don't need an answer. I just like that's what I'm chewing on, and I don't know what is the right answer going forward, and it also.49001:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.820The Alliance: you know, the other question is.49101:18:06.500 --> 01:18:33.229The Alliance: if this should this be a monthly thing that people stay in until they're through their masterpiece. Is that the better framework? And we go really slowly? Instead of a 4 month sprint, and like we cap it at like 30 people in the monthly thing. And then once a year, I do a 4 month thing to onboard. A new group like those are the questions I'm trying to answer. Some of it is, hey? What's fun for everybody?49201:18:33.230 --> 01:18:41.328The Alliance: Right like, how do I? And and what's fun for me, and what and what works and what's actually, what do people really need? I49301:18:42.640 --> 01:18:56.489The Alliance: you know, some people I'm like, oh, I I can move. I can get you someplace really great in 4 months. And some people I'm like, Whoa, that's a big dream like you're probably. Gonna and you're starting from really back here, and that's like like I can help you. But it's gonna take a couple of years and like Whoa.49401:18:56.490 --> 01:18:57.740Courtney Karnes: Yeah, manage? The actual.49501:18:57.740 --> 01:19:01.959The Alliance: I. Those are like, those are my like.49601:19:04.110 --> 01:19:23.440The Alliance: They're not even there, I mean to me. And this is the we knew this like this was built to raise these questions to surface this information, to show me this stuff, and to get me into like, here, into these like this? Is I this was. It was built to do this so like it's right out of schedule. But now I'm like, Huh! Interesting. Not sure.49701:19:23.440 --> 01:19:35.809Courtney Karnes: I won't give you answers because you're not asking, but and nor do I have them necessarily. But I will say I did not feel like I got hit in the face with the baseball bat. When I left I was disappointed to leave, and I wish I knew.49801:19:35.830 --> 01:19:41.739Courtney Karnes: I wish I didn't have that other conflict, and I wish I could have immersed myself, which leads me to the other point, which is.49901:19:41.750 --> 01:19:54.190Courtney Karnes: when the group comes together, some coming from the Uk. Or whatever like. How do we optimize that time, and maybe take more of it, like the luxury of being together and unprogrammed togetherness like very important.50001:19:54.190 --> 01:20:17.530Courtney Karnes: And then the other piece that comes to mind for me is our next gathering is in person in mine and Brian's home city, so like, can I be helpful in hosting something? Are there other groups that we want to convene like? Does auric host a dinner for you and other thought leaders to like come together outside of that like, how do we make use of the movement that's already happening within the calendars to to really connect.50101:20:17.870 --> 01:20:21.310The Alliance: Oh, meaning like yo, you like you live in San Francisco. I forgot that.50201:20:21.310 --> 01:20:22.070Courtney Karnes: Yeah.50301:20:22.330 --> 01:20:23.710The Alliance: Coming to San Francisco.50401:20:23.710 --> 01:20:28.480Courtney Karnes: I'm south of San Francisco, and I'm up in the City weekly for meetings so like.50501:20:29.370 --> 01:20:37.669The Alliance: Yeah. So I was gonna come in the day before. And I can. And like the answer is.50601:20:37.830 --> 01:20:49.370The Alliance: you tell me like, yes, like, we'll figure it like, Yeah, I like, this is exactly like, yes, is the answer. And please don't make me have to figure it out. That's why it's no longer.50701:20:49.370 --> 01:20:50.115Courtney Karnes: Yes.50801:20:51.190 --> 01:20:53.050The Alliance: Like, okay. Bye, alright.50901:20:53.050 --> 01:20:53.600Courtney Karnes: I'm gonna come.51001:20:53.600 --> 01:21:00.229The Alliance: I'm usually I'm usually it. If if I could fit into my schedule. When am I coming in on the 17, th what is that.51101:21:00.230 --> 01:21:03.090Courtney Karnes: You're the 17th is the event, and then oh, my question is.51201:21:03.090 --> 01:21:03.740The Alliance: Oh!51301:21:03.740 --> 01:21:07.240Courtney Karnes: Do? Can we get past this for that whole week? I want to go to that whole thing. Can you.51401:21:07.477 --> 01:21:18.872The Alliance: Let me. Yeah, let me talk to let me talk to Nicole. What I'm gonna what I'm gonna tell her is, but we're coming in on the 17.th Can we show up on the 17, th and then come down the 18? th I'll talk to her about it.51501:21:19.110 --> 01:21:20.290Courtney Karnes: But let's think about.51601:21:20.290 --> 01:21:23.099The Alliance: You also. Here's the other thing is51701:21:23.360 --> 01:21:42.450The Alliance: you need to meet, and you will love and get to know Nicole Bradford, who's running the event. Who's my who's a really old, a dear and old friend of mine. She's a badass has done a lot of like. She built the Transpersonal tech conference she knows more about like the tech side of like51801:21:42.450 --> 01:21:57.920The Alliance: self hacking than anybody in the world, and she also used to run World of Warcraft China, and she was the 1st woman to run a gaming company in China so, and she's black, which is like amazing. They hired a black woman to run world of Warcraft in China, which is just fucking like51901:21:57.930 --> 01:22:10.397The Alliance: he's a badass, anyways, but she's doing her whole thing is is sort of the AI for good kind of questions as well, and she's in San Francisco, and you should meet her, and52001:22:12.570 --> 01:22:20.220The Alliance: sort of a community of the forming around the X prize that's asking similar questions. But I can't quite figure out if they're real or not. But52101:22:22.612 --> 01:22:29.887The Alliance: I need to get you at some point my book. If I haven't sent it to you in like 2 weeks, would you just ping me and say, Steven, book52201:22:30.790 --> 01:22:31.490The Alliance: Oh.52301:22:31.620 --> 01:22:39.430The Alliance: I need to get through this week with my editor and get it into like I'm still gonna turn. It's you're. I'll show it to you before, like52401:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.220The Alliance: you're gonna see? You'll see, it's not 1st draft. It's polished draft, but it's not like the final material. But I just want you to see it because it's gonna52501:22:49.490 --> 01:22:52.880The Alliance: bark so many things, and it's only 200 pages long. It's fast.52601:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.949Courtney Karnes: The energy of a manuscript is my favorite energy. So I'll read anything and I'm grateful. Thank you. Yes.52701:22:57.950 --> 01:22:59.890Courtney Karnes: Okay. Yeah. That.52801:22:59.890 --> 01:23:00.330The Alliance: You build it.52901:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.991The Alliance: I'll read anything because I'll give you my 1,000 page new novel, and we'll see how you do.53001:23:08.250 --> 01:23:12.160The Alliance: Don't ever say that to me I will abuse that privilege. Alright.53101:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.409Courtney Karnes: Let me- let me start the.53201:23:13.410 --> 01:23:18.720The Alliance: There. Yeah, there I there is a here's 1 other quick thing.53301:23:19.980 --> 01:23:28.800The Alliance: I need I. So I'm for my book on intuition that I'm starting to work on. I need stories about intuition, very, very, very famous people.53401:23:28.880 --> 01:23:44.750The Alliance: preferably a lot younger than me. I'm good at the over 45 crowd like I got lots of connections. They're all badasses. But I like, you know, I need a Dj. Who's in their twenties who's super famous. I need a video game person. I need a53501:23:44.750 --> 01:24:00.112The Alliance: female CEO, who is really great with intuitive decision. Making has some really cool stories. Who's a like? I really, I'd like to feature one. I would like to feature way more women in this book. My! My books, because the nature of sports have leaned a little male, heavy53601:24:00.970 --> 01:24:11.399The Alliance: And I'd like, you know, I'd like this book to lean female heavy. A little bit. So anyways, those are like, I didn't actually think I was gonna have an answer to how you could help me. I gave you 5.53701:24:11.400 --> 01:24:16.340Courtney Karnes: You need to. You need to interview the CEO of Canva Melanie Perkins.53801:24:16.990 --> 01:24:41.930Courtney Karnes: I don't have a connection to her yet, but I can see if I can find one for you. Maybe someone in your network does. But canva is like the creative design platform, you know, and she, everybody was like. There's no business here and now here she is. It's like a 42 billion dollars business that she's built. And she trusted her gut. She said, design needs to be more. I don't remember her quote, but it's like design needs to be more accessible for the masses, and she created a platform to do it. And now canva is literally.53901:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.260The Alliance: It's so it so that is54001:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.870The Alliance: awesome. That is perfect and canvas perfect for this54101:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.915The Alliance: sort of sort of thing. And54201:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.759The Alliance: I could probably get to her.54301:24:55.140 --> 01:25:08.129Courtney Karnes: Also like, Okay, so that's the thing I want you to think about. Like when you come to the wherever wherever we're going to meet up, or if we can like, orchestrate that alchemy together, she's 38. So she's under 40, born in 87.54401:25:09.100 --> 01:25:30.709Courtney Karnes: Let's assemble some tables to move, because your network and the network you need to reach is in line with my network that I need to reach for work and personal personally interested in that network so like if I could leverage the org, you know, corporate account to bring together interesting tables for dinner, to have you positioned as a thought leader, or a convener, or whatever like. What does that.54501:25:30.710 --> 01:25:35.809The Alliance: However, yeah, I'm interested. I mean, I'm interested in like, I like.54601:25:35.960 --> 01:25:42.290The Alliance: that's an interesting. It's an interesting question on what we're gonna point to, I mean, like, the next thing my company cares about is, you know.54701:25:42.410 --> 01:25:53.980The Alliance: we're launching for the 1st time ever we're doing flow writers live, which is always. It's 50, 60 people, but it caps there because there's it's interactive in the room, and I can't go much above it, or people feel left out.54801:25:54.790 --> 01:26:10.890The Alliance: But we're gonna do a flow for writers digital this year for the very 1st time, like, it's becoming a digital product. And the craziest thing about it is because the nature of the digital market is only $2,500 because you can't sell. You need salespeople. If you're gonna sell something that's over $2,500, and I won't put up like it's gonna be a funnel.54901:26:11.223 --> 01:26:31.230The Alliance: It's you're gonna get. You're getting like a $20,000 writing program for $2,500, which is crazy. But that's what my team cares about is like, how do you like? How? Who are like promoting and building up flow for writers. So that's their like. That's their question. My questions are always things like, like55001:26:31.270 --> 01:26:50.869The Alliance: I like. I've spent so much time lately redesigning the the flow research collective newsletter, and I fucking love it for the 1st time ever, or my newsletter now I wanna I want it to go everywhere, because I'm actually finally proud of it. It's not like it's it's so cool. So those are like, I'm just trying to solve those. You know, those standard problems. I don't know if that55101:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.342The Alliance: beats into anything but55201:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.090Courtney Karnes: Have to. Now that I have it in my mind, I can let.55301:26:56.090 --> 01:26:58.859The Alliance: The other. The other thing is, if you wanna like the55401:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.690The Alliance: have a conversation with Chase also on my team, because he's great at that stuff like I. You know I can.55501:27:04.690 --> 01:27:05.130Courtney Karnes: Yeah, what?55601:27:05.130 --> 01:27:16.669The Alliance: If you're if you want to think about it, you know what I mean. Ryan's really good at like this, but the planning with chase is really good at finding like alignments, and you know ways to maximize it for everybody. He's good that way.55701:27:16.670 --> 01:27:17.549Courtney Karnes: Yeah. He's cool.55801:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.900The Alliance: Okay.55901:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.390Courtney Karnes: I'll go. I'll reach out to him.56001:27:19.390 --> 01:27:25.489The Alliance: Cool. Good! I I know what your next steps are. And I will see you on Thursday.56101:27:25.490 --> 01:27:30.450Courtney Karnes: Okay, thank you. Can you share the recording of this? So I can go back to it. Is that something that can happen? Brian can help me with that.56201:27:30.450 --> 01:27:31.540The Alliance: Oh, the zoom!56301:27:31.650 --> 01:27:45.799The Alliance: Yes, I well, so here's what I you, you one or the other. My new plan is to take these have an AI. Transcribe them, summarize them, and get us both copies with my new.56401:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.100Courtney Karnes: Okay. Great. I don't want to watch.56501:27:47.100 --> 01:28:07.489The Alliance: Yeah, that's my, that's my new strategy. I just told Ryan I was like, I need to do this because I the other thing is this is how I'm gonna one. It's our personalized action plan. That's how we're gonna get. Like, if I fold this data in with what we're already measuring. We're gonna have good results. But I also realized that this is how I'm gonna figure out56601:28:07.640 --> 01:28:14.329The Alliance: what I actually need to teach next time I do this, or how like what the future this looks like. Alright.56701:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.210Courtney Karnes: Yeah, love. It. Okay.56801:28:15.210 --> 01:28:15.610The Alliance: We're on it.56901:28:15.610 --> 01:28:17.180Courtney Karnes: Steven, I really appreciate you.57001:28:17.180 --> 01:28:21.000The Alliance: You are welcome, and I'm gonna do a text intro to my friend Krista Stryker.57101:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.839Courtney Karnes: Thank you. I appreciate that you're welcome. Alright! We'll talk soon.57201:28:24.040 --> 01:28:24.820The Alliance: Bye. Courtney.
