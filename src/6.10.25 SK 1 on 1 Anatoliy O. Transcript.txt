WEBVTT100:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hello! Hi, Steven!200:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.769The Alliance: Hey? How are you?300:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.399The Alliance: I'm very well, thank you.400:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.110The Alliance: You.500:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.689The Alliance: So quick top, down over you to kick us off.600:01:32.010 --> 00:01:44.750The Alliance: Have you been working on the 3 flow triggers that we started out with. Have you added in a feedback shit list? Have you been drawing a couple of times a week, and have you been doing the meditation.700:01:48.990 --> 00:02:00.462Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I have been drawing a couple of times per week so a actually, what happened is that had a week off, and I didn't draw during that time, so I was800:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.529Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: on on a path for accelerated drawing. So I've been drawing a fair bit several times a day.900:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.530The Alliance: Awesome.1000:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.249Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And this has been very very cool experience1100:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.500The Alliance: Nice.1200:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.110Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: In a I was really surprised with how how quickly that helps1300:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.830Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like with a reset. It's like 10Êmin of drawing. And and it's like1400:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.789Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 2, 3Êh of stressful work and conversation before that. They're just gone.1500:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.760Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So.1600:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.690The Alliance: It's the it's sort of the amazing, you know, embodied1700:02:39.148 --> 00:02:51.560The Alliance: embodiment as a flow trigger. Right? When you pay attention with multiple senses at once. It pulls your attention to the present and blocks out the past, basically, in one way or another, it's gonna pull you into Alpha1800:02:51.560 --> 00:03:10.629The Alliance: right? Because there's no other. You can't do what he's doing. You can't like follow along with the dude and not do. It's instant I'm so psyched. That's so exciting to me you found exactly what I wanted you to find fantastic, fantastic. Have you been doing? Meditations at the end of the day?1900:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640The Alliance: At all? Have you been using the vipasta as a reset meditation?2000:03:14.640 --> 00:03:25.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No, I I was not doing the meditations but I was. I was following quite religiously the the wind down ritual and2100:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.500Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, being being very, very conscious around.2200:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know I have to stop at a particular time at a at a peak, not pushing myself beyond that, you know.2300:03:39.855 --> 00:03:40.260The Alliance: Good.2400:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.642Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: For making sure. You know it's an official, and then nothing comes afterwards.2500:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.299The Alliance: And there's a work. How is that working for you? What have you discovered?2600:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.010The Alliance: That's so cool.2700:03:51.640 --> 00:04:02.580Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, I I have been. I have been doing that. I've been trying to to do that, even even when I, when I was in the previous in a in a 0 to dangerous, and in the accelerator2800:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.253Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: what really2900:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.960Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: like? I have to say that within it was what? 3 and a half weeks, 4, 4 weeks since3000:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.760Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: since the since starting, I of that 4 weeks I had3100:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: one week off, and which was like completely off3200:04:24.046 --> 00:04:29.719Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and 2 weeks, which probably were the most effective weeks I can recall.3300:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.760Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Like, like properly3400:04:36.290 --> 00:04:49.789Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: one week was a little bit so-so and that's that's probably probably because it got over overtired. So they won those 2 weeks which were extremely efficient.3500:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.319Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It is like the re- Really, the 1st time I when I expected, when I kind of3600:04:56.750 --> 00:05:06.724Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: properly done everything, and still had kind of time for for other things without any any sort of3700:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.960Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Gilbert, when you know the time3800:05:12.090 --> 00:05:21.139Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you're done with the task, and you still have 10Êmin that never happened to me. You know it's usually overrun, overrun, overrun. So that that was really cool. And I I got.3900:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.835Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, really really jumped into that. And really, really, addicted4000:05:28.910 --> 00:05:36.819Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that was that was very cool, and I think the wind down is one of one of those important things just to sort of4100:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.600Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: structure. The day, despite the day and incorrect.4200:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.630The Alliance: And and you're setting clear goals at the end of the day around your wind down time.4300:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.430Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes, yes. So, starting with starting with deep work straight out of bed4400:05:53.230 --> 00:06:04.629Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Then another session, you know, mid morning and all sorts of catch ups and other things and meetings kind of during during the day, and that has been doing.4500:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.509Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, wonders I have to say so. I'm very happy.4600:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.876The Alliance: That's fantastic, Anatoly, if you4700:06:14.300 --> 00:06:22.270The Alliance: if you want to drop the vipasta meditation in. And I it it sounds like everything's full, but it will.4800:06:22.440 --> 00:06:45.929The Alliance: because of the style of meditation over time in the beginning it'll just calm things down a little bit more and help you sort of reset a little more deeply. But over time, as you get to the open senses, part of it like it'll start to amplify creativity even more so. It's sort of like the meditation works very well in conjunction with the drawing as sort of4900:06:45.980 --> 00:06:58.820The Alliance: co-stimulants, but if the drawing and stuff is working really well for you. Keep going with it this month. We switch to the to the writing. Steal your style writing stuff. I don't have you experimented with that so far.5000:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.775Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And then no, not yet again. I have this. I have this thing where5100:07:04.970 --> 00:07:15.190Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I've done all the drawing, but I didn't submit the things on time. 1st I was a little confused on how to do it. Then I was traveling, and all of that. So I'm kind of5200:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.459Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: have this crazy goal. I need to do all the classes and submit. It's a big.5300:07:19.460 --> 00:07:32.830The Alliance: That's all that totally fine, like, totally fine. I just want, like we're progressing that way. But as long as you're doing creative stuff between tasks. You're getting what I what I want the the5400:07:32.980 --> 00:07:54.150The Alliance: you'll start to flex different creative muscles along the way, and it'll feel different. And that's really what you want to test, because you want to figure out at the end of the program which one's the one that's really right for me. But that's where we're going with that. Okay, so that's awesome. That's really exciting. Tell me, what can I help you with today?5500:08:08.060 --> 00:08:20.459Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: So it's not. It's not sort of on a, on a, on a, on a personal flow. But just thinking about about my my business idea I came to5600:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.270Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: last 2, 3 months I have been working on5700:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: the very detailed articulation of what will be going on starting from.5800:08:33.980 --> 00:08:43.860Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know, the financial model, the business model equity story, all of that stuff. And now gotten to a part where I really want to think about the educational program.5900:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.270The Alliance: Pardon me.6000:08:47.610 --> 00:08:53.850Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And I have been taking a lot of a lot of the feedback on board, including including yourself, that6100:08:54.290 --> 00:09:02.828Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you need to. You need to get people in the mood, so not in the mood, but sort of when people are entering6200:09:03.870 --> 00:09:30.620Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: entering this path of of transformation, and a lot of them are going to be closed, and a lot of them are going to be overworked, and it's the 1st step is to take it easy and and just get them decompressed into into sort of an open mind, and then start start working working without. So those kind of tips also understanding that it has to be a very.6300:09:31.170 --> 00:10:00.180Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: not overwhelming start with a few with a few particular very practical, practical things that people start engaging and get, understand the benefits of it. I've read also in this flow team flow book a lot on how how they advise. Well, actually, not a lot. It's it's it was. It was a chapter, but I think it was very useful, but they basically advise how to set it up and start the conversation. The conversation within the team.6400:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.610Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But I've never6500:10:03.200 --> 00:10:16.500Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: taught anything in in my life like I've never been a teacher or or a coach, or anyone like that. And for me, one part of this equation is the content. But it does sort of the6600:10:16.710 --> 00:10:23.260Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: figure the part which can be figured out. I think the different part is the delivery of it right? How to6700:10:24.590 --> 00:10:33.080Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: not overdo it and or maybe how to6800:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.530Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: be strategic about structuring that, and how to get to that6900:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.825The Alliance: So let me7000:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.420Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: That doesn't doesn't make sense what I what I'm trying.7100:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.589The Alliance: No, no, totally does let me read it back to you, and let me add one thing in, let me make sure I've got it. So there's the content piece.7200:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.090Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yes.7300:10:51.490 --> 00:10:58.837The Alliance: And you said you're comfortable. You're you're comfortable with that which would which is awesome, though I7400:10:59.888 --> 00:11:03.601The Alliance: I would, I would say that.7500:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.959The Alliance: you have to remember that to deliver content.7600:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.520The Alliance: It's really a story.7700:11:12.630 --> 00:11:30.699The Alliance: You're delivering a story. Otherwise it's not gonna stick deep enough. So it's way one is determining the content. And 2, I think that it's flowing into a story, a narrative that is, gonna make sense to your audience is 1, 2 delivery. And really, what you're talking about is curriculum pacing, I think.7800:11:30.750 --> 00:11:56.629The Alliance: And the thing I wanna mention there that that I want to caution, not caution. But I wanna put into your head is something we've noticed. Because you're right when when we train clients, especially in more corporate environments. Also, we see the same thing. People are freaking, burned out. You gotta start them by, you know. Let it get enough sleep at night and getting them, you know, a release activity or a recovery activity.7900:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.430The Alliance: for sure.8000:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.260The Alliance: But here's the downside.8100:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.920The Alliance: They will not do that8200:12:05.510 --> 00:12:23.620The Alliance: on its own. You have to tag team that with something for performance. So like, do this. Do this get better, more, because it's just if they know the recovery stuff already. Very few people don't know the recovery stuff already. Very few people are like, oh, really, I should sleep.8300:12:23.750 --> 00:12:35.909The Alliance: You know what I mean. Maybe they don't know the exact numbers, but people sort of get that stuff. They're not doing it. That you have to figure that out. The 3rd category that I believe you're completely missing, and I'll give8400:12:36.150 --> 00:12:56.639The Alliance: us as an example is accountability. So this is a long standing, real issue. It's why I've got Ryan talking to you guys on the back end of it. It's why we're meeting 3 times a month, one way or another. It's actually 5 times a month, really and let me8500:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.820The Alliance: mentioned that we're meeting 5 times a month.8600:13:00.270 --> 00:13:25.940The Alliance: and you're really down with the program. But you skipped the recovery active of a positive recovery activity completely. And you took a week off in in the middle and then overburdened yourself another week. So that's that's not unusual. That's just sort of right. That's sort of average for people, because life gets in the fucking way, and8700:13:26.060 --> 00:13:42.619The Alliance: nothing makes as much sense to them as it does to you. So there's huge drop offs like I can tell out all of you people in the Alliance, for example, that hey? You should do all this stuff at once. It's literally designed to work synergistically, and you're gonna get much bigger benefits.8800:13:42.620 --> 00:14:01.970The Alliance: But it's gonna take you a while to believe me and get there, and sooner or later you know what I mean. You'll start to get your kind of results, and you're like, holy shit. This stuff is really working. I should layer in it right. And that's the path that everybody takes. That's not unusual, as far as I could tell. That's the path that everybody takes, like even your dream students. So you have to have8900:14:02.120 --> 00:14:25.209The Alliance: accountability metrics built in. Basically, you need babysitting metrics, because otherwise people are not going to get there. What's challenging about babysitting metrics is in today's world. If you text people all the time. If you email them all the time. If you bug them all the time, they will tune you out. That's spam, and we tune out spam. So it's this really complicated9000:14:25.280 --> 00:14:48.339The Alliance: balance that you will absolutely run into. And if you don't get out ahead of it before it starts, you're gonna get. You're not gonna get the results you want, right? Which is, gonna kill your program before it can get off the ground. But I think there's 3 prongs. There's this content storytelling piece. There's a curriculum pacing and delivery, and there's accountability. The only thing I will tell you about9100:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.200The Alliance: 2 and 3,9200:14:51.320 --> 00:15:00.899The Alliance: and then I'll shut up content. You can sort of. And I want to say, 75. You're gonna come up with a hundred percent of the content. You're gonna be right about9300:15:01.790 --> 00:15:30.390The Alliance: 50 to 60% of it. Because, as anybody knows, in product development. And this is true with curriculum, too, it always takes 3 iterations to create the product you want. Right? First, st you create the product you think you want, then you get your feedback from your customer to figure out how you broke it, and then you fix it right, and that's pretty much curriculum in my experience as curriculum, too. So the real question is not just content, you know, not just these 3. It's9400:15:31.010 --> 00:15:59.839The Alliance: what's the what's my minimal viable product, right? Like, what are my mechanisms for these things? So I could then take it into the real world and start to test it. And how do I design a piecemeal testing strategy that allows me, you know, a couple of weeks between iterations to iterate a little bit and think about this stuff and fix because all it's you know, this is especially curriculum when you're playing with live humans in a very specific field. And you've never done this before.9500:15:59.910 --> 00:16:12.589The Alliance: Areas got a plan until you get punched in the mouth right? You're gonna get punched in the mouth by your plan a bunch. There's no way around it. You should expect it. You should enjoy it. You know what I mean you should grow from it, but you should also, perhaps9600:16:15.070 --> 00:16:23.871The Alliance: not dismiss the entire like art form known as coaching and educate. You know what I mean like9700:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.590The Alliance: you're going to have to get9800:16:28.230 --> 00:16:34.029The Alliance: really good as a storyteller, and you're going to have to get a lot more patient9900:16:34.420 --> 00:16:46.829The Alliance: with your pupils. I would guess. I I'm just tell like I see a little bit of me and you and these are shit things I had to do like I was like, Come, the fuck on! What do you mean? You're not like what? What fuck you?10000:16:47.390 --> 00:17:07.699The Alliance: You! You go home. I'm going to the circuit. You know what I mean like, and and that doesn't do anybody any good. But I was like so shocked along the way at how little people are willing to actually do, despite big changes ahead until the big changes show up. Once you start producing flow, once the compound interest compounds and you start changing, then10100:17:08.079 --> 00:17:16.530The Alliance: your work is, then it's then then it's self generating, and you don't even have to drive it. But until you get them to the point that there's real results.10200:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.579The Alliance: They're not producing the accountability, the the motivational neurochemists.10300:17:25.220 --> 00:17:33.629Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Understood and guess within that early, straightforward wins are are very important to. To.10400:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.090Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: to get to that self reinforcement, self reinforcing stage.10500:17:38.090 --> 00:18:03.310The Alliance: Yeah. That's why that's why I don't think you could just go with sleep and recovery right off the bat. You gotta get like you got your early self reinforcing wins in my stuff 2 ways. You got them through because clear goals, such a big lever. And if you actually like. If you couple clear goals with a decent recovery, you know a couple of those things, you'll get it. But also we layered in drawing, which is10600:18:03.310 --> 00:18:14.230The Alliance: doing a bunch of stuff, including priming the brain with some dopamine like there's a bunch of different levers in there that I got to pull with. You guys. That are harder to pull in corporate environments.10700:18:15.460 --> 00:18:22.565Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Hmm! Well, and and I just so that no, there's no misunderstanding. I'm not planning to be10800:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.469Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: to be a coach, or the person sort of delivering the content. I don't10900:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.199Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: exclude joining some of that every, every, every, every now and then, or.11000:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.210The Alliance: Oh, so you're gonna hire for that. You're hiring for that.11100:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.050Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I want to create.11200:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.149The Alliance: Oh, excellent! Excellent! Okay, that's perfect. That's even better.11300:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.710Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, because I I don't think I'm you know.11400:18:43.240 --> 00:18:55.680Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I would probably enjoy it eventually. But also it it has to serve a purpose. And there are people who are good at this, and it's it's a matter of building a business for me rather than me.11500:18:55.680 --> 00:19:18.099The Alliance: Then that's perfect. That's great to know. I think you probably would get good at it. Over time, like I I think you would probably be a really cool teacher over time, but I think it would take a while to get there, and possibly not be worth your time. But I definitely think you I like I you know I could be totally fucking wrong. What the hell do I know? I don't have some 6 cents for educators. But you know.11600:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.910Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, cool.11700:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.619The Alliance: What what else does that make sense.11800:19:26.110 --> 00:19:33.010Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, that makes sense. And and listen, I'm really starting here from a blank page. Right? I've never had11900:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.949Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: any experience like that. I.12000:19:37.380 --> 00:19:54.510The Alliance: So let me let me give you a simple exercise to move your content ahead. Because once you get so you can't actually figure out what your pacing is until you lay out your content. But this is this will be fairly simple for content. Think of everything you're doing as12100:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.730The Alliance: like12200:19:57.670 --> 00:20:11.160The Alliance: poison. Is it a half hour module, followed by you know, a half hour breakout, group discussion, kind of like whatever it is, and each module is probably going to be 10 to 20 slides a Powerpoint12300:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.350The Alliance: right?12400:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.640The Alliance: And12500:20:13.780 --> 00:20:27.769The Alliance: or you know what I mean and do it that way, and think about each of those slide decks as a story, right? So are you gonna start with a story right to capture people's attention and go into a point. And then.12600:20:27.770 --> 00:20:51.119The Alliance: you know, go into a practice. However, you're gonna do it. Figure out what like, what's the model? Right story into whatever, into whatever. Or maybe, you know, make case study from business into whatever, into whatever you know what I mean. I vary it right. Sometimes I lead with a story, sometimes I lead with a science experiment. Sometimes I leave with a case right? Whatever whatever you think. And it's really about who's your customer?12700:20:51.120 --> 00:21:00.290The Alliance: Who's your audience, or that right? That's the question you're trying to like solve with that. But if you could build sort of like a loose formula for it, you can build your modules.12800:21:00.350 --> 00:21:10.059The Alliance: and once you could build your modules you could start thinking about delivery. What's the homework for each module? How much is too much? You know what I mean and12900:21:11.170 --> 00:21:20.739The Alliance: no no matter what, it doesn't matter how much you tell people. Most people have 3 slots in their brain for working memory. And that's about all they're gonna hear13000:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.229The Alliance: in any given time frame. You know what I mean.13100:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.923Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Do you? Do you talk about the the goals for for the transformation upfront, or that's not13200:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.910Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: not critical.13300:21:36.040 --> 00:21:45.020The Alliance: Oh, I think it's so both to sell a program and to hook a customer. You have to give them a vision of13400:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.120The Alliance: where they're gonna be. You have to point. You have to help them see their pain13500:21:50.550 --> 00:22:06.112The Alliance: because we have lots of defense mechanisms. Freud wasn't wrong. So they got to sort of see their pain, and then you gotta. They also have to see the promised land. This is at every level in this process. This is marketing. This is sales. This is content. Delivery.13600:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.599Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I. I have to say that that I when I went into into say 0 0 to dangerous.13700:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.600Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I wasn't entirely sure what I'm getting into. I I have to say, there was.13800:22:21.710 --> 00:22:31.320Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: There definitely is a very efficient pointing to the pain. And there's definitely is a promise of the Promised Land. Yes.13900:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.119The Alliance: So let me let me, Anatoly, one of the reasons that I stopped selling 0 to dangerous.14000:22:36.220 --> 00:22:49.449The Alliance: and I pulled. It is because of that, I think re end. When we redesigned the program, broke the front end a little bit and it always bought. It always bothered me. The problem is14100:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.719The Alliance: to fix it. You have to decide.14200:22:53.920 --> 00:23:15.130The Alliance: where is everybody starting from? So in the alliance, right? Like, you guys are, start. And you guys were pretty and selected to be close to the same starting point. And you guys are really all over the map. And we tried to get a group that's as close to the same starting point as possibly could. And you guys are still really all over the map. So14300:23:15.730 --> 00:23:23.309The Alliance: we made a decision in 0 to dangerous that with knowledge workers that they're so burned out. We're gonna start there. And what14400:23:23.410 --> 00:23:48.389The Alliance: we stripped out was was enough view of the Promised land. And I think it so. I think we made some errors with. We tilted slightly, and when I redo it, that's what I'm doing. If we weren't off that by that much. But I think it was like a 20% direction alteration that really hamstrung people's results. Anybody went all the way through the program.14500:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.540The Alliance: got14600:23:49.880 --> 00:24:03.679The Alliance: 70, 80% boost and flow because it we like, we know that. But the motivation to get people to go all the way through the program that was lacking, because we broke it on the front end, and we could never quite fix it, because we couldn't14700:24:03.850 --> 00:24:30.539The Alliance: figure out how to do a choose your own adventure kind of thing at the scale. We were trying to do it with coaches and everything else. So that's 1 of the reasons I pulled. I like. I think if you're going to do a choose your own adventure, you can't have coaches, and if you're gonna have coaches, you can't do a choose your own adventure. It's an either or and that depends on what scale of business you're trying to build and who you're trying to help. And when and that sort of stuff. So these are, you know, things not. These are14800:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.599The Alliance: issues I haven't solved for myself entirely yet, but they're there.14900:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.790Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay, understood.15000:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.180Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Thank you.15100:24:45.180 --> 00:24:56.679The Alliance: But I do. I do, I do think, starting to like I would. I look at curriculum sort of like a book outline. You know what I mean. There's an introduction. There's 10 chapters, and there's a conclusion.15200:24:56.980 --> 00:25:11.099The Alliance: Okay, cool. I've got so my bed, 10 big slots, say, or 8, or whatever it is right and then it's break it into like, okay, each of those things is probably a story, a point, a story, a point homework15300:25:11.370 --> 00:25:19.130The Alliance: story, a point story, a point home. Right? So you could very easily start building that15400:25:19.930 --> 00:25:30.819The Alliance: and then making decisions about cause. I think the other stuff pacing delivery accountability will flow from once you get sort of start getting the curriculum I like.15500:25:31.275 --> 00:25:36.799The Alliance: what you said was starting with group flow. As well. I'm not necessarily certain like.15600:25:37.610 --> 00:25:45.914The Alliance: is it like recovery? Practice, like, you know, is it recovery, practice, sleep, and a discussion about collective15700:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.290The Alliance: goals?15800:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.270Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Remember.15900:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.130The Alliance: Perhaps16000:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.610The Alliance: so. What do you? What what? What else is going on? What else can we? What else can we push across the line.16100:26:06.450 --> 00:26:23.240Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: that I mean, it's an extremely busy time for me. I I've got 2 injuries in the last 2 weeks, so I've at least stopped training for for a marathon for some time, but even without that, that's like proper for 14Êh 14Êh, days.16200:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.678Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: so a lot going on. And I think the more16300:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.710Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: The most important thing which I feel is to kind of keep that16400:26:34.500 --> 00:26:47.869Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: consistently, consistently going, because I'm 1 who sort of can easily stay, you know, until 4, and then fuck up the week the week past that. So for me, kind of making sure that16500:26:48.080 --> 00:27:13.499Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: I am operating efficiently day after day after day after day, without kind of big ups and downs that's kind of really on on top, on top of my mind, and and also that I'm moving like very, very many agendas forward. Right? And that also means you've you've blinked, and some things is sort of behind so that really.16600:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.689Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: really, really is is on top of top of kind of thing for me.16700:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.480Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And I have to say that you know the past.16800:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: This past couple of weeks16900:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.969Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: were really really encouraging, and I was I was really happy with with how things are working out.17000:27:32.769 --> 00:27:45.149Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: One thing before be before they the end of the end of our call. I wanted. I just thought that I would share this with you. It doesn't have to have anything to do with business. But it's basically17100:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.920Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: a17200:27:48.450 --> 00:28:03.550Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: friend of mine. Someone I knew from like 15 years ago invited me to participate in in in an interesting activity. It's basically 20 people who don't know each other, but who all share kind of common17300:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.668Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: connection somewhat so they would probably know each other within like 2 handshakes or something like that, maybe one17400:28:11.886 --> 00:28:18.810Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: they they get into a house together with a modern musician.17500:28:19.230 --> 00:28:26.550Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: musician and composer who does like somewhere on the verge of classics and electronic music.17600:28:27.240 --> 00:28:35.300Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And they leave in that house for 5 days with the idea to create music, while17700:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.559Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: none of them, except for the guy, are actual musicians or or composers17800:28:42.190 --> 00:28:50.209Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: with an idea to, you know. Finish that 5 days with some musical product, and get17900:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.470Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: people without direct, everyday knowledge of how to do it into the creative process of18000:28:56.930 --> 00:29:04.680Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: of of music creation. So that's something I will be doing later later. In the summer.18100:29:05.298 --> 00:29:19.619Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: It it is, you know, intended to be intended to be like a vacation with a degree of this of this activity. So it's not sort of a hardcore, hardcore type of thing. It's, you know, intended to be fun more than anything else.18200:29:20.250 --> 00:29:25.049Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: But I think it's a very unusual experience, and very much looking forward to that.18300:29:25.980 --> 00:29:31.289The Alliance: 2 things I could tell you off of that. So I just got back from Summit a Summit event.18400:29:31.480 --> 00:29:49.439The Alliance: They do that every single night. They have a band room with musicians, where they literally bring in non musicians. Teach them all a little something, and get them all playing together, and people fucking rave about it. I've only participated a little bit, because usually it's late night, and I18500:29:49.440 --> 00:30:17.819The Alliance: tired like I don't want to be in a loud like. I might want to stay up and hang out and talk, but like being in a really loud room with the that's not my jam. At the end of the night, but people rave about it, I mean, we rave about it every. I was just at a summit event like I, my friend Amy came up and was like, I've got a tambourine lister on my thumb, and it was so fucking fun and so the other thing. If you want to check it out out of curiosity. You could find this, I believe, on itunes.18600:30:17.820 --> 00:30:23.329The Alliance: So a bunch of years ago, a bunch of my friends who were in a bunch of bands.18700:30:23.350 --> 00:30:29.989The Alliance: the Maroon, 5 phantom planet Gomez, a couple other bands.18800:30:31.190 --> 00:30:47.900The Alliance: a couple of guys from Disney, who are Disney Imagineers, and my friend, Chris Mccann, who's a photographer, took over a Treehouse hotel in Hawaii somewhere. I think not. The big island, one of the Oahu, no, not Oahu, one of the Kauai Kauai, took over a treehouse hotel.18900:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.390The Alliance: moved in, wired the entire place for sound.19000:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.749The Alliance: built instruments out of ship. They found19100:30:56.980 --> 00:31:05.900The Alliance: and recorded an album that's called operation. Aloha! That's beautiful, like it's really pretty. That you could find on itunes19200:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.400The Alliance: operation, Aloha.19300:31:11.460 --> 00:31:33.070The Alliance: and you could find it on itunes. And it's like Maroon 5 phantom planet Gomez, and a couple of people, a couple of the bands that I can't remember. And then there's a bunch of weirdo creatives taking over a tree house to make music for, but I think they did it for like 2 weeks, too. I think that's a great cool thing to do. I think that's I think that's gonna that's a perfect vacation.19400:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.330Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, very, very much.19500:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.910Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Looking forward to it.19600:31:38.740 --> 00:31:48.688The Alliance: That's really a cool. That's really a cool thing. I'm loving the progress you're making. This is really exciting. Thank you for diving in. Thank you for. Thank you for trusting me and19700:31:51.710 --> 00:32:00.839The Alliance: keep up with the consistency. I'm so psyched that peak exits. Did you actually run the clear goals, exercise and count how many things you could be excellent at in a day.19800:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.239Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Well, I sort of have a target of19900:32:09.290 --> 00:32:14.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: 3 3 major major business goals.20000:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.220Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Okay?20100:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.510Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Oh, and20200:32:17.690 --> 00:32:26.975Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: or maybe not major business goals, but 3 major things across business, and say, say sometimes in something else,20300:32:27.920 --> 00:32:38.450Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: and a few smaller things, and a bit of sports and and drawing. If that all comes together that's like perfect. But that is already20400:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.270Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: very challenging.20500:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.264The Alliance: Yeah, I know. like that.20600:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.129The Alliance: it's about my goal every day, the sort of the way I get.20700:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.060The Alliance: I think the way I get over with it when I when I hit it, is20800:32:58.910 --> 00:33:07.599The Alliance: because I live in the mountains, and because I have to hike my dog every day, and I do weight vest hikes when I know I can't get to the gym or go skiing.20900:33:07.900 --> 00:33:16.020The Alliance: I I put on. I put on my 20 pound 30 pound weight vest, and I just dash up the mountain and come back down, and21000:33:16.260 --> 00:33:27.030The Alliance: and if I move it, a pretty good clip in, like, you know, 1520Êmin going uphill, my dog, and you know I can get a little bit like that's how I sort of like21100:33:27.420 --> 00:33:55.829The Alliance: figured it out on the busy days, and I think that's the way I can sort of balance it. And because I do my meditation in a sauna when I also read at the end of like my recovery thing is like end of day. Get in the Sauna. Meditate for 10Êmin, read for 10Êmin, or 20 and 20 kind of thing brunch them together. It allows. That's the only way I can do it, because I'm like you. I get up at, you know, 4 o'clock in the morning I go to, so I've got 1415Êh days every day.21200:33:56.252 --> 00:34:01.450The Alliance: So I gotta sandwich it together when I'm not, you know. There.21300:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.308Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: And and one thing, one thing which I've got a lot of21400:34:07.010 --> 00:34:14.870Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: out of the the super efficient past few weeks I've started to do a lot of getting a lot of stuff done on the go.21500:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.809Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: which was my thing. But but really now, when it's clear, when it's bite size when sort of I am in the in the drive. I'm getting things.21600:34:24.330 --> 00:34:36.170Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: you know. 3, 3Êmin walk, 4Êmin walk I get, you know, 2 text, or like an email out and and stuff like that, and that feel that that's really energizing and and also re21700:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.150Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: reinforcing.21800:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.539The Alliance: Yeah, that's the so you you could.21900:34:41.849 --> 00:34:46.539The Alliance: You might notice at the end of a deep work session, right? When you're coming out22000:34:46.679 --> 00:35:03.069The Alliance: I will sometimes stack like those little tasks. I'll do like 5Êmin of emails right then. So I get like all my deep work done. And then I get the the little goal shit of like. Oh, I got 5 things off my plate, and next, and then I'll then I'll transition.22100:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.020Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: Yeah, cool. That's.22200:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.250The Alliance: Alright. Will we see you? Are we gonna see you on Thursday?22300:35:11.470 --> 00:35:17.619Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: No you so sorry on Thursday. Yes, but I'm not gonna go to to.22400:35:18.003 --> 00:35:18.769The Alliance: San Francisco.22500:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.530The Alliance: Okay.22600:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.100The Alliance: Okay.22700:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.590Anatoliy Otchkovskiy: What gonna be the the other in person? Meetings.22800:35:27.843 --> 00:35:29.010The Alliance: We are22900:35:29.480 --> 00:35:38.290The Alliance: talking about it right now. We're looking at ryan was taking people's pulses. We were looking at 2 options. One was a possible23000:35:38.300 --> 00:36:01.680The Alliance: journey up to Mount Hood in July. That'll be like the 15, th 16th of July just through like a 2 day. Little ski meet up Mount Hood's really a mellow mountain, so like there's no, there's no nar up there. It's just an intermediate sort of mountain with a Terrain Park, and then in August we were talking about23100:36:02.130 --> 00:36:16.319The Alliance: possibly getting a pause. You wanted to go see Lincoln Park in either Nashville or Chicago and I don't know where we are on those decisions. And if either of those things fall through.23200:36:16.570 --> 00:36:35.159The Alliance: probably just gonna show up in Los Angeles, and we'll have dinner one night right?
