WEBVTT100:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.500The Alliance: Who's up that guy?200:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.550The Alliance: What are you doing?300:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.800The Alliance: Hi! Hi! Big guy! Where you going?400:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.229The Alliance: What are you doing?500:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.560The Alliance: Is that your corner? Is that where you want to be. I like it in the corner. Huh!600:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.910The Alliance: I like the corners all right.700:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.729The Alliance: Hey? How are you.800:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.179JasonTadros: I'm well. How are you?900:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.049The Alliance: I'm great.1000:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.320JasonTadros: Sure.1100:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.360The Alliance: Really good.1200:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.710The Alliance: I want to jump in because time is tight.1300:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.909The Alliance: and I wanna cover as much as we possibly can. But I want to start with1400:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.380The Alliance: the fallout. I I have a modus operandi1500:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.850The Alliance: which I find is very effective, though maybe not the most pleasant1600:01:26.990 --> 00:01:50.809The Alliance: experience for my my clients, which is like hurl things that people. And one of the reasons is, I want to see what sticks like 3 days later. Right? So I want to dive into your challenges and really and really focus there. But I want to start by what like, what resonate, what's like immediately actionable. What are you like? Fuck? Yeah, this is, you know, I'm doing this. What are you noticing those sorts of things.1700:01:51.510 --> 00:02:08.679JasonTadros: I'll tell you right now the work that I'm doing taking sort of all the things that I've been. We were talking about and putting it into real models. I've been training an actual AI built on the math that I've been doing. And it's1800:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.749JasonTadros: it's gonna turn into a business 100%. And I'm actually applying for a Darpa grant. Based on it. In mathematics.1900:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.840JasonTadros: So that's what I've moved everything into actionable versus just paper writing. And yeah, it's pretty pretty amazing. Actually.2000:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.377The Alliance: That is really, really cool. I've got a million questions that come off of that.2100:02:42.290 --> 00:02:54.610The Alliance: so it's really like it was a clear goals sort of like, how do you get from clear goals to mass a massively transformative purpose or a high, hard goal in terms of next steps that really broke open for you is that it was that framework.2200:02:54.986 --> 00:02:58.750JasonTadros: 100%. Yeah, it was just like putting it into.2300:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.439JasonTadros: you know, what's what, what's concrete? What? What can I actually do with this? How can I bring the conversation from a conversation to just2400:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.329JasonTadros: demonstration? And yeah, I mean.2500:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.640JasonTadros: I'm I'm really blown away. The fact that I actually train an AI2600:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.362JasonTadros: built not on gradient descent, but on a tractor space.2700:03:26.210 --> 00:03:36.430JasonTadros: is pretty crazy. And I I did it with multiple mixture of experts sort of acting like salience networks in the brain2800:03:36.570 --> 00:03:45.470JasonTadros: and it. And they started to specialize. And they started to actually build some interesting things between language and mathematics itself.2900:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.340JasonTadros: and I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't just dummy.3000:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.969The Alliance: Yeah, I will. I will say on a separate topic while I think3100:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.019The Alliance: writing with AI is mostly a lie3200:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.912The Alliance: so far and and and and honestly3300:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.450The Alliance: even the tiny stuff that AI does for writing3400:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.770The Alliance: it ends up breaking things much more. And I think so. But as a tool for science.3500:04:17.010 --> 00:04:32.169The Alliance: It's the like. It's crazy what you could if you like. If you know how to ask her a good question. You fed it the right information. It's fucking nuts. What you can do in about 10 min, like it's really it's legit crazy. I told you, like Michael Menino and I were in a conversation I was3600:04:32.570 --> 00:04:43.730The Alliance: I had. This is where all the whole thing I told you came from this weird, weird insight, where people were like arguing that it was conversation about hand psychism.3700:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.299The Alliance: And I was like, let's replace3800:04:47.430 --> 00:05:00.929The Alliance: consciousness with information which we know is fundamental to the universe. Right? Like, let's just start there. And let's start with one second idea, which we also know is true. But nobody ever thinks about which is information impacts nervous tissue.3900:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.940JasonTadros: Yes.4000:05:01.940 --> 00:05:24.499The Alliance: Right, like flat out information. So if we know those 2 things are true, what? What are the 1st principles and go from there? And I fed this into an AI, and in 10 min we had a war. We had a viable solution to the hard process of con problem, and as of last week. We actually have math. We took Kelso's the hakeem the Kelso hakeem equation that underpins coordination dynamics.4100:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.800The Alliance: Yeah.4200:05:25.360 --> 00:05:36.670The Alliance: what to see does. What can it apply to this theory like, can can this? And it works like we can prove mathematically that qualia emerges from metastable4300:05:37.267 --> 00:05:53.782The Alliance: information? Which is fucked mathematically at least, which is, it's a model. So yeah, all right. So that's this is not big performance. This is us being geeks. Which we could do forever. Let's let me let me ask you 2 questions. Question one4400:05:55.070 --> 00:06:09.449The Alliance: I'm fascinated that you could turn this into a business, and I love that you. You're building it. What I would suggest is an exercise for you, because I think it's going to be the most the biggest unlocking move. I just actually talked to somebody else and give them the same homework.4500:06:11.500 --> 00:06:35.220The Alliance: If you if this is a business right, whatever that is, and you're and and the next step is feeding the models. And AI, right? There's a hundred steps in between. There are probably more, but there's a hundred that you probably can identify. Make the list. And I'm talking about like building website, marketing material, like all the like, all the stupid stuff, because the4600:06:35.220 --> 00:06:47.200The Alliance: thing that you want to do is every one of those stupid things is actually probably like 7 things. You know it like once you start looking at it, you're like, Oh, this and the with big projects like this4700:06:47.360 --> 00:07:03.890The Alliance: one, you want to be able to feed the clear goals, checklist every day with literally like, what's the next thing? So it's a hundred things, and then it's what's the order. And once you have that, it's right, then you just feed. Next thing goes into your clear goals list until it's done clear goals like, and that's just how you do it. But what happens when you4800:07:04.170 --> 00:07:17.740The Alliance: get that list out there is one. It's a it lets you go. What can I outsource? What can I get? An AI to do right? What can I hire for what don't I want to do? Right? So 1st you have that full list.4900:07:18.090 --> 00:07:28.019The Alliance: then you you don't lose the motivation that so many people lose when you get to an item that you're like, Oh, I got to do this. And suddenly, you're like, Oh, wow! This is a 6 week5000:07:28.120 --> 00:07:52.839The Alliance: thing, and it's awful. I gotta do all. Oh, fuck! And then, like you're the life gets sucked out of your project, and there goes the momentum. So you don't want to be blindsided by the day-to-day mendacity of what you're trying to do. You actually want to make it visible. So you can make decisions about your time and money. And then the next thing, the most important thing period especially for big dreamers.5100:07:54.880 --> 00:08:05.929The Alliance: When you've got that map, then you have to start saying, Well, what do I, Jason? Really fucking? Wanna do like what? Look, what's my sweet spot? What do I want to do all day? How do I want to spend my day, because5200:08:05.930 --> 00:08:27.280The Alliance: if my business built on my dream doesn't match up specifically with who I am as a person, and how I want to live, and how and how I can succeed. You don't have a good business model. You've got a pipe dream that's going to crash and burn because it's not tied to you. So people assume that just because they're on a new dream, they're going to be different people. We're not.5300:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.690The Alliance: We're just us.5400:08:28.870 --> 00:08:34.560JasonTadros: I'll say that that is a challenge that I struggle with actually a lot. Frankly, that- that5500:08:35.010 --> 00:08:45.356JasonTadros: because I I really don't want to do the business. I always want to find a CEO to run the business, and I've never found anyone that can do that like I can.5600:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.059The Alliance: Here's what I always tell people on this. This is like5700:08:49.900 --> 00:09:00.999The Alliance: Park, the CEO dream on the side cause you know it actually is. It's a nightmare. It's a nightmare. It's a fucking nightmare. It just is. You lose control of your business. It's not like5800:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.710The Alliance: maybe there's some advantages as going to scale, and if you want to, but5900:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.710The Alliance: at least in the beginning, right? That's not a decision you want to make, in my opinion. And 26000:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.220The Alliance: the thing that people always forget. And you're gonna see it right away.6100:09:16.570 --> 00:09:31.210The Alliance: When you look at your personality, who you really are, what you like to do most in the world as limitations you're gonna get. Oh, I gotta hire a CEO, whatever. But if you look at from an engineering perspective, they're boundary conditions.6200:09:31.620 --> 00:09:48.630The Alliance: Now you're solving a problem that has boundary conditions where your personal predilections are a boundary condition, and what you think the business can do in the world or a boundary condition, and you just feed them into the chat. Gbt, and say, these are the boundary conditions. This is the system. What's the business.6300:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.520JasonTadros: Plug it.6400:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.500JasonTadros: I like it.6500:09:50.500 --> 00:10:08.230The Alliance: It'll it'll give you. It'll give you that people treat their personality as a limiting factor. It's not. It's a boundary condition like I. This is how we got to the Alliance right. And here's how I know, like, here's how here's what happens when you do it right. I was very concerned about these one on one calls.6600:10:08.360 --> 00:10:16.805The Alliance: Not that they I was considered they were going to be draining. I was concerned I wasn't going to be good at it. I was concerned I would be useful. I was all this stuff, right?6700:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.180The Alliance: and it turns out none of those things are true.6800:10:20.350 --> 00:10:27.149The Alliance: Right? 10 calls. Then I could tell you none of these things are true. All those fears are wrong, and that what I thought was actually a wall is actually a doorway.6900:10:27.290 --> 00:10:41.230The Alliance: Chatgpt was the one who told me to do it this way. It didn't like. I literally have to know like this is how this formula did this. This is the alliance came from, and the reason I know it was good. Steering is because things that scared me7000:10:41.260 --> 00:11:10.059The Alliance: are actually like I'm opening the doors, and I'm like, Oh, no, this fits me really. Well, this is a good decision. I see this is what happens when you steer from boundary conditions, so you can really do it. You can. Don't think of it as a limit. Think of it as a boundary condition. So I tell you 100 things right, the checklist, and then all your boundary conditions. You know what I mean. And then you're like, how do I get to my business? How do I, what? What is the business? Where? What cause like? Sometimes, when people say I need to hire a CEO. What they really mean7100:11:10.120 --> 00:11:16.770The Alliance: is, I need to onboard like 2 skill sets I don't have and hire a fractional part time. Cfo.7200:11:16.830 --> 00:11:40.150The Alliance: right? Or that's really often what people mean, right? They mean. I don't want to do the accounting. I don't want to deal with legal and fucking Hr. And getting insurance is a nightmare, and somebody's got to pay attention to that stuff to do. So that's actually no, no! What are the skills I need to learn to be able to AI and outsource large chunks of that.7300:11:40.150 --> 00:11:47.460JasonTadros: Pipelines I need to build. And then how does a fractional CEO help me govern? What are the dashboards I need to build.7400:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.629The Alliance: So I can see my company without7500:11:49.630 --> 00:11:59.290The Alliance: you know that sort of stuff. Press me. I took a hundred person company and shrunk it into a 3 person organization, 4 person organization. And it's running better7600:11:59.450 --> 00:11:59.940The Alliance: right?7700:12:00.311 --> 00:12:18.159JasonTadros: Literally live what you're telling me. I should be telling myself for companies, right? And that's what I do. I build systems that optimize them shrink them down. Do all these things. I just don't walk the walk enough for myself, I think, and great to hear that.7800:12:18.160 --> 00:12:27.299The Alliance: It's because I think it's because people often like when it comes to self, they think it's a more complicated thing it is. It's literally a well crafted, clear goals, list.7900:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.710JasonTadros: Good.8000:12:27.710 --> 00:12:40.500The Alliance: And the commitment to execute that list every day, and the intelligence to go get some fun and flow on the side. So you don't get the life blood sucked out of you by your monster right like that's sort of the like.8100:12:40.660 --> 00:12:51.619JasonTadros: Yeah. And I have all the little you know companies to do this AI running, and they outsource offshore this or that, or whatever. I could easily assemble that together myself, and that makes perfect sense. Yeah.8200:12:52.080 --> 00:13:09.280The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I. By the way, this is, I like, I am trying to get budgets together for all the things I'm doing this week and next week, so that the like, once I get all that like, then I can start getting AI on like some of this stuff and really like. I haven't yet8300:13:10.090 --> 00:13:21.949The Alliance: used it enough for all the stuff. There's a whole bunch of skills. I think, like, I think there's higher level skills. My team may need. I may need to like, bring people in to help steer a little bit, because there's gaps.8400:13:22.589 --> 00:13:25.780JasonTadros: Would love to just chat about that. I've been chatting.8500:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.350The Alliance: Yeah, I'd like.8600:13:26.350 --> 00:13:52.449JasonTadros: Parts, and they've been amazing, just very lightweight. I haven't given them that they need to do high galleon process on everything, just to, you know. Get rid of all the the pieces that are true. But I think it's sort of starting to unlock them a little bit. Just the idea of thinking of it like, Hey, this employee like in 10 x, it's not a search engine. And look at it that way, you know. Type of thing. So anyways.8700:13:53.123 --> 00:14:01.980The Alliance: Alright. So that's a this is a great place to start. What? So what? 1st of all, let's let's dive into like what you brought for us today? What, what are, what challenges are in front of us.8800:14:03.206 --> 00:14:07.893JasonTadros: I mean right now. It's as simple as this I have.8900:14:08.570 --> 00:14:21.720JasonTadros: kind of my biggest thing is is between my work and what I'm trying to do. So at the same time, I'm also interviewing with Hasbro for a go to market executive position.9000:14:22.116 --> 00:14:34.170JasonTadros: And that's kind of the balance is, you know, life, the thing that makes sense, and everyone understands around me, and what I could probably do and make, put this in the background and do it a little bit more of a9100:14:34.270 --> 00:14:47.259JasonTadros: a hobby thing and trying to balance the fact that hey, this got real legs. I gotta get literally, the Darpa project just came out. That's exactly. I'm at Trl level 6 for it.9200:14:48.010 --> 00:14:53.459JasonTadros: But balancing that, you know sort of the dream and the reality.9300:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.210The Alliance: Let me ask you a question.9400:14:55.210 --> 00:14:55.800JasonTadros: Yeah.9500:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.799The Alliance: If you get that position.9600:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.204JasonTadros: Yeah.9700:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.250The Alliance: How many hours do we think it is a week.9800:15:01.845 --> 00:15:02.440JasonTadros: Is.9900:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.280The Alliance: That's right. It that I mean, that sounds like a 70 HA week job to me. Am I wrong?10000:15:09.530 --> 00:15:22.399The Alliance: I mean, if it was, if it was 50, I would say, oh, we got this. You know what I mean, because now I got. I got 20 HA week for your your cause, so let me ask you the question about the job. Is it10100:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.250The Alliance: you need the money you want the money either, or fine, like.10200:15:27.250 --> 00:15:27.780JasonTadros: Cool.10300:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.930The Alliance: Okay, so the job is gonna happen right?10400:15:33.389 --> 00:15:37.100JasonTadros: Behind the scenes, and I'm I'm trying to like not go there.10500:15:37.100 --> 00:15:44.150The Alliance: Yeah, no. I mean, like, I think you should like like start to plan around it. So the question is really like10600:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.830The Alliance: one, when will it start?10700:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.250The Alliance: 2?10800:15:51.170 --> 00:15:58.490The Alliance: Can you like? Can now that cause? The truth of the matter is this, here's what I think we here's what we want to do.10900:15:59.470 --> 00:16:07.750The Alliance: Let's say it's a hundred steps to this dream. Okay? And let's say realistically, it's a 2 year11000:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.270The Alliance: process which it probably is.11100:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.870JasonTadros: So.11200:16:12.870 --> 00:16:29.670The Alliance: We especially with another job? Right? So the question is, 100 steps, like, once the steps are visible. And you say, Okay, 2 years is what I'm well, I'm gonna give this while I build this in the background, and you know the quest. The question. I always will tell you if you think it's a business.11300:16:29.840 --> 00:16:53.099The Alliance: start nights and weekends. You know what I mean. It's make it a hobby business for sure. Try to figure out like as you're building it forward. What's the smallest way? What's like? How do I start small? Just test it? Does it work? Do I like it right? Because I'm assuming the job like it sounds like, if it's not a high, it's high. 6. Figure low. 7. Figure job that you're applying for11400:16:53.501 --> 00:17:00.320The Alliance: so you're gonna need to fill a million dollar gap in your income with this business. So11500:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.820The Alliance: the question that I would ask is like.11600:17:04.089 --> 00:17:30.199The Alliance: How long do you have to work Job X, until you could save like, how long it like, there's gonna be a point that you're like, okay, I gotta. I'm gonna launch this right? I'm out. I've done that. So there's some amount I have to have saved for a budgeted for like. So this is essentially like time and budget. This is stuff that is very visible. Once you start saying, No, this is really gonna be my life. So what I need, what you really need11700:17:31.090 --> 00:17:37.759The Alliance: is a way to get up and spend the 1st 90 min of your day on this project.11800:17:37.930 --> 00:17:58.029The Alliance: and then 1 5 h block on the weekend, and then maybe 1 4 h. Block after work is is, Tim Ferris pointed out. If you're creative and you're trying to do a hard problem, you probably need 2, 4, 4 and a half hour blocks of thinking a week. That that's just that for that, right? You're just gonna need it.11900:17:58.510 --> 00:18:07.450The Alliance: But other than that, if you can chunk it right and advance your cause 90 min a day. You can really maintain momentum right? You have to sort of.12000:18:07.450 --> 00:18:25.380JasonTadros: Also gonna use that momentum from the the role I mean. So, for example, I just chatted with the singularity guys again. You know, when I was at Mattel I brought them in. I'll bring in the Ipp thing. My contacts will come back. I've been working with Nvidia and all these guys before. That's why I have all the relationships there. I feel like.12100:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.909The Alliance: And and you fucking, know that we're gonna do some flow stuff to get like whatever right.12200:18:30.910 --> 00:18:36.670JasonTadros: So this is like, you know, I got Ibm quantum computers. Those guys want to do something so like.12300:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.749JasonTadros: you know, shit and health children.12400:18:40.250 --> 00:18:47.710JasonTadros: What better? I mean? You know, education, early childhood flow. I mean, you know, hell. If we can create something there, we can change the world.12500:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.700The Alliance: Well, I mean.12600:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.049JasonTadros: I'm not putting it there, but I.12700:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.716The Alliance: No, I mean to me, what's interesting about like this is sort of what rolled out of.12800:18:57.610 --> 00:19:13.999The Alliance: If all this stuff turns out to be true, and it works with the flow stuff that we've been doing and the like. It all lines up right. It's all one theory, as far as I can tell and you know there's a secret I've had. I've already gotten. I believe it or not. I don't, so I don't have an answer for the12900:19:14.330 --> 00:19:22.020The Alliance: mystery, the woo portion of it. And there's a there is an acknowledged woo portion of synchronicity which I'm talking about, but I have solved13000:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.960The Alliance: a bunch of it in terms of. And I might have solved for a really skeptical person like, if you're skeptical and you don't. Wanna13100:19:29.170 --> 00:19:46.192The Alliance: my solution is actually right, like, it's right like it explains the phenomenology. It explains a lot like I've got that or a if you actually are paying attention to the level of information that you're getting in those moments. No, there's a there's still a puzzle there. But,13200:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.650The Alliance: we're 2 thirds of the way there. So my point is that all this stuff13300:19:52.090 --> 00:20:10.950The Alliance: floats around my core topic, which is more important to me than children, though it's the same fucking topic which is worker reskilling. How do we use AI to radically reskill workers who are going to lose their jobs to AI, right? Like I always said the one I've always said, we have to start with is truck drivers because they're13400:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.899The Alliance: they give 10 years until the largest blue collar workforce in America is unemployed. Right? So.13500:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.570JasonTadros: It's the greatest network for anything like literally, it powers everything.13600:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.949JasonTadros: I don't think anyone knows the network function of it that keeps everything going. Yes.13700:20:27.230 --> 00:20:43.999The Alliance: And so I like I to me. I I just look like Worker Reskill all when one of the reasons I like all the people who are still building flow systems for scale and companies and things like this is because I think we're heading for a cultural disaster. If, like AI will like13800:20:44.360 --> 00:20:55.109The Alliance: the big existential stuff I think we solve. But it, worker reskilling like you, we need a Manhattan style project for worker reskilling in an age of AI operation is scale.13900:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.600JasonTadros: Attack. I think the only solution is pairing.14000:20:58.700 --> 00:21:15.029JasonTadros: It's a cybernetic pairing of AI. The AI becomes your firewall becomes your your identity. Structuring sort of thing that takes information, integrates with other things and allows you to get that that 10 x otherwise, you know, then it's just a bolt on. It's a tool, something else. You gotta bring the tool.14100:21:15.030 --> 00:21:22.369The Alliance: I? Oh, I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. So it's not even worker reskilling. It's like14200:21:23.790 --> 00:21:30.349The Alliance: it's how do you train truck drivers in AI to find their passion and purpose right like, that's really the question you're asking.14300:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.073The Alliance: Right? That's interesting. That's a slightly different question. That's a better question than what I was asking.14400:21:35.540 --> 00:21:41.010The Alliance: all right. So on the work-life balance front.14500:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.615JasonTadros: Yes.14600:21:43.240 --> 00:21:50.340The Alliance: What I think. Yeah, to me. Actually, I think I think we're gonna get the most benefit, the most lift here.14700:21:50.530 --> 00:22:04.849The Alliance: If we can get the 100, the list of a hundred, and then we can get it categorized by time. So step one. What's the 100? Step? 2. What's the order? Step? 3. How do we slide this order into my job14800:22:05.480 --> 00:22:12.310The Alliance: into a way that it leads to a hobby business I could do at the same time, and and each feast each other clearly right?14900:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.369The Alliance: I wouldn't worry.15000:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.840The Alliance: Pardon me.15100:22:14.840 --> 00:22:25.130JasonTadros: I'll tell you where I'm going with that my brother is in defense. And so this opportunity, this dod thing came through my Linkedin, I've had some15200:22:25.680 --> 00:22:53.069JasonTadros: people reach out before in different areas. But long story short. Functionally, this is exactly what they want. It's mathematics. AI, that solves mathematics, creates new equations, goes for. And does that that solution that it like? I said, I'm I'm I'm readiness technology for that. So if I can get that over the next month or 2 and get into that program. My brother can run it from the side, and that's how I'm I don't know. I'm.15300:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.149The Alliance: Jason, what's your what's your phone number?15400:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.240The Alliance: Not a text.15500:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.359The Alliance: I want to text you something. Hold on 9 1. What.15600:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.760JasonTadros: 9, 1, 7.15700:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.990JasonTadros: 6, 5, 5.15800:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.190The Alliance: What?15900:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.059JasonTadros: Or 6 0.16000:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.840JasonTadros: And if you send me the fact that we're competing on the same, ask, I'm gonna lose my mind.16100:23:12.840 --> 00:23:24.559The Alliance: No, I'm not. This is not an ask. I just thought I was like, wait a minute. This the the math that I would you mentioned the math thing, and I was like, wait a minute. My quality of math is right here, like it's a 1 pager. So I just texted it to you.16200:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.910JasonTadros: Okay.16300:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.877The Alliance: Yeah, I just texted you my one pager16400:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.110The Alliance: you could fold this into your darfa. Grant.16500:23:32.435 --> 00:23:41.230JasonTadros: Gonna this thing actually has created new algorithms and optimized itself. So I feed its own algorithms16600:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.280JasonTadros: back into itself to optimize itself.16700:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.230JasonTadros: I don't know if that makes sense.16800:23:47.230 --> 00:23:55.152The Alliance: What is it not pick like? How do you avoid? This is a totally geeky question. But16900:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.369The Alliance: how do you avoid like17000:23:58.530 --> 00:24:08.019The Alliance: synchrony, brand and training. How do you avoid the attractors becoming too powerful and locking the system into those that right? Do you see what I'm saying.17100:24:08.765 --> 00:24:22.279JasonTadros: Complete. So basically, I have some noise, different pieces in there that I create different experiments. Kind of thing. These different experts go off and look at different things, and.17200:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.329The Alliance: Oh, I see.17300:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.170The Alliance: Okay.17400:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.720JasonTadros: And then I create this thing. I create the stability17500:24:27.840 --> 00:24:43.230JasonTadros: from all of that. And if one of the experts goes off and becomes sort of a divergent personality, or crazy, I, you know, chop it off in some way right? I close the the the possibilities there. But I do. If there is possibilities there.17600:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.150JasonTadros: let's explore it, and then bring the other guys. And then we we keep going.17700:24:47.150 --> 00:24:54.500The Alliance: Realize that's interesting, that oh, it was. I mean, it was a really super simple answer.17800:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.020The Alliance: I'm trying to.17900:24:55.020 --> 00:25:06.890The Alliance: I introduced noise. Okay? Well, okay, that's exactly what that's the right answer. I like I I should have known that right? Like I should have known better. And 2. Your noise is really smart18000:25:07.060 --> 00:25:22.390The Alliance: like that's interesting, like, what a really interesting, conceptualizing, different opinions, essentially different. Expert opinions as noise in a tractor system would work like it like it would work right. I think.18100:25:22.390 --> 00:25:30.320JasonTadros: You gotta have Co, I mean, that's basically it. Right? We're just trying to cohere and not, you know, have a have a balanced view of the universe. And18200:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.649JasonTadros: that's the same thing.18300:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.830The Alliance: You want the edge of criticality, not criticality.18400:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.380JasonTadros: Always.18500:25:35.380 --> 00:25:43.420The Alliance: Yeah, like, yeah, yeah. Bad things happen. What would criticality? You have an epileptic seizure. It's not good like, let's we don't do that18600:25:43.920 --> 00:25:59.260The Alliance: alright, so I love. I love all these steps. Tell me what else is going on. Tell me where, what else we can go to next, because I think what I think is gonna happen is if you lean, if you make out if you collect all the steps and you lean into this new job as a18700:25:59.420 --> 00:26:10.469The Alliance: cool for getting you A to B, and you look start looking at that way. Yeah, there's gonna be annoyances. There's gonna be weeks where like it wins and you lose right? Those those exist. But if you really18800:26:10.890 --> 00:26:18.450The Alliance: get up early and just carve that, you know what I mean, I'm just gonna do that. And this is my commitment. And this is the only way I can do this job.18900:26:19.080 --> 00:26:45.439The Alliance: that becomes the priority, I think what you're gonna find is that like you got a really clean like 2 and a half year plan that makes a lot of sense. And you don't want a bigger plan than 2 and a half years. Anyways. So much is gonna happen along the way. And you know this like this, this thing is gonna if you get these early steps going? It's gonna start to accelerate exponentially. And you net like, could be one project so alright? What else? What else are we doing in the next half hour?19000:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.739JasonTadros: Oh, my goodness, that was a lot I feel empowered.19100:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.517The Alliance: Yeah. Well, but by the way, one of the things that we've learned about these calls is19200:26:55.270 --> 00:27:11.159The Alliance: you, I don't need an hour. We don't need an hour. As far as I could know, 40 min has been where most people sort of like not do this tap out. I get looks for people like, I gotta go, Steven. Like enough. Enough. Steven. Yeah, exactly.19300:27:11.160 --> 00:27:19.941JasonTadros: Just a little bit. But no, I mean, this is this is, this is this is important. I think the net. If I were to just be real about sort of next steps. It's19400:27:20.430 --> 00:27:37.560JasonTadros: you know, I'm working on my relationship piece coming back. I think it's gotten a little better. That's still a work in progress, but support is starting to get both my children and my wife are starting to at least stand by and and support. I don't think they get it all but.19500:27:37.560 --> 00:27:43.980The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, the thing is as your shit becomes visible, and little steps that you check off. The19600:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.970The Alliance: here's the thing. I didn't say this when we were all standing around. But I should. This is the19700:27:50.460 --> 00:28:07.529The Alliance: problem and or opportunity here like this is how you move people. The problem is that what happens is, people are who you are in their mind, the person they met. You are not you. You don't. You don't get to be the person you became. You're literally locked down as the person they met right?19800:28:07.760 --> 00:28:34.330The Alliance: The way you get to be become somebody else is you doesn't matter what you say, because they've been with you too long. They've seen you say things and then not come true, like we've all seen that in our spouses our children like we all do it to each other, and as a result they only believe action. So if you're like, you know, if it's a hundred steps between the shit Daddy's been talking about. That doesn't make any fucking sense, and like what I'm actually talking about.19900:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.259The Alliance: And you start ticking them off. Now you're the hero20000:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.200The Alliance: you're like, Oh, my God! You had a vision! You're going through it, and I see you kicking off the chat like.20100:28:43.330 --> 00:28:59.869The Alliance: Then you know, then this that that you you end up with allies that way, because, you know, they came along for the ride, and you know you start saying things like, thank you for being so patient with me while I managed to crystallize this, and you know blah blah, and.20200:29:00.293 --> 00:29:06.229JasonTadros: Yeah. Didn't see it until you just said it that way. But that's.20300:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.760The Alliance: No. But then, like you know, like, I'll tell you a funny fucking story.20400:29:10.680 --> 00:29:17.150The Alliance: Cedar D. Madness meant me when I was a 27 year old dirt or punk rocker20500:29:17.970 --> 00:29:38.120The Alliance: kind of a genius writer, maybe, but like that's who I like. I was journalist. I was like I was dirt poor. I think that year we met I made $75,000 like maybe if I got lucky, maybe and I might have still been bartending at that time, too. And so for a very long time20600:29:39.620 --> 00:30:04.789The Alliance: it didn't matter that the world to the world I was literally the world's leading expert on flow and peaking performance, and long before I actually deserved that title like, I don't think I deserve that title until Mike passed during Covid and I started publishing the papers I've been publishing now, like, yes, it's an undisputed title like I want that particular one. But like it took a while, but everybody started seeing me that way very early on, except my wife20700:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.400The Alliance: and or my business partner, Peter, and still like20800:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.299The Alliance: trying to get flow stuff in some of our early books20900:30:13.430 --> 00:30:27.979The Alliance: was a war, because Peter saw me as a 27 year old punk rocker, not like the world's leading expert in this very esoteric topic. That was suddenly very relevant. And it took a really long time. And it took like.21000:30:28.420 --> 00:30:39.750The Alliance: you know, it took me building a couple of companies, and, like, you know, doing the actions that he recognizes as Oh, this is this is that thing. And21100:30:40.990 --> 00:30:47.229The Alliance: it is what it is. You know what I mean like, I wish it wasn't the case, but like it's the case.21200:30:48.185 --> 00:30:49.970JasonTadros: Yeah, I, wish.21300:30:49.970 --> 00:30:50.630The Alliance: I just.21400:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.520JasonTadros: You just want to be like, Hey, believe? But yeah.21500:30:53.520 --> 00:31:06.740The Alliance: No, I mean, that's why I like I really live by. And this is so. I don't. So I live by real bad boys move in silence. I don't live by things. I want to be cool, or anything like that. I live by it because21600:31:06.920 --> 00:31:26.980The Alliance: you get fucking green by the people who love you. If you don't move in silence like you gotta the goals gotta be accomplished before you open your mouth and tell anybody that like you know, or you gotta be. It's gotta be next week. Otherwise you're jeopardizing safety and security, and there's loss aversion. And there's like.21700:31:26.980 --> 00:31:37.839The Alliance: you know what I mean, like, you know, the worst thing you could be. If the CEO comes to the company and goes this week, we're gonna innovate and the whole company goes. Oh, shit! You know everybody does.21800:31:39.191 --> 00:31:42.239JasonTadros: I do that to my family regularly.21900:31:42.240 --> 00:31:51.655The Alliance: Right? You can. You can. It's just the thing that we don't think about with the people that we love is because we want them to be so fired up, for what we're fired up about is22000:31:52.400 --> 00:32:10.309The Alliance: They have, like all the cognitive biases literally developed for this moment, like you are the breadwinner. So like anything new, there's loss, aversion. There's recency by like, there's all this stuff. That's when the cognitive biases are at their absolute fucking. Worst.22100:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.700JasonTadros: Right.22200:32:10.700 --> 00:32:20.370The Alliance: So like you, essentially sound like a conspiracy theorist to your loved ones when you're early early stages of chasing grand goals like you do.22300:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.230JasonTadros: Yeah.22400:32:21.420 --> 00:32:27.610JasonTadros: I see it, and I I expect more. But I recognize that it's a human. It's a lizard of wins, I mean, that's it.22500:32:27.610 --> 00:32:52.350The Alliance: Yeah, no dude. I like I I fucking. I'm with you. A 1,000 like you're like, why is this not like this should not be true, but I think about it like, so you've been to the same conferences I've been to where like it's the the abundance 360 crowd. It's all the like dopamine adult entrepreneurs who like haven't actually run a company right like really wide eyed. And every week, just like talking like they're on cocaine. You've been in those rooms, and you're like.22600:32:52.600 --> 00:33:00.899The Alliance: if you've been to enough of those conferences, you realize these people actually don't do anything but go to these conferences and talk about their dreams. They don't. Actually.22700:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.720The Alliance: there's no, there's nothing there.22800:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.780The Alliance: The home leaders.22900:33:03.780 --> 00:33:10.939The Alliance: Yes, they're conference junkies, and they literally have been high on dopamine for 5 years, but the dream has not moved. You're like.23000:33:11.170 --> 00:33:20.119The Alliance: oh, that's a that's an addiction, that's not. You're not an entrepreneur. You're an addict. That's a different thing. You should get some help.23100:33:20.120 --> 00:33:26.689JasonTadros: Yeah, I like, man, you put words to my mind. Yeah, thank you.23200:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.899The Alliance: It's no I mean, by the way, I think the only reason I'm good at this is because, like23300:33:31.030 --> 00:33:46.060The Alliance: it's not that I like. I don't think any. I think the suffering I think we all suffer the same things. I've just. I get paid to put language around stuff that's hard to put language around. That's sort of my job right? And once you put language around, you're like, Oh, this is how I talk about that thing.23400:33:46.060 --> 00:33:46.390JasonTadros: Yes.23500:33:46.390 --> 00:33:52.489The Alliance: Oh, it's and it's suddenly it's not this big incoa. Probably uncertainty is gone. You're like this is the thing that oh.23600:33:52.600 --> 00:34:00.729The Alliance: I can think inside that box right? Suddenly, you're not powerless. Yeah, we forget how much23700:34:02.660 --> 00:34:12.010The Alliance: reduction of information occurs between thought and language in that simple like, it's a massive reduction of information. Right? You're in.23800:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.609JasonTadros: Last thing I've been working on last night23900:34:14.880 --> 00:34:26.550JasonTadros: says that some symbolism, mathematics, language, all of those things are exactly those observational24000:34:26.989 --> 00:34:32.900JasonTadros: triggers that we should be able to see on the eg. As it comes together in that coherence moment exactly.24100:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.009The Alliance: Oh, I should send you my weird24200:34:35.949 --> 00:34:39.989The Alliance: thought paper that I didn't really write. But I started to ask.24300:34:44.619 --> 00:35:11.059The Alliance: I wanted to work the math on do memes function as strange characters in culture. And what happens if we start treating memes as strange attractors and mapping culture that way? So you could actually start putting complexity dynamics on culture with memes as your attractor basins. And I worked, I did a whole bunch of stuff that I like. I don't actually know if I got anywhere with it, I can send it to you. It's just fun. These are like, yes.24400:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.539JasonTadros: Where is this?24500:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.240The Alliance: Steven.24600:35:12.460 --> 00:35:34.620JasonTadros: Is it if you take it all back, that connection to the neuroscience and everything that's the connection. It's creating those spaces, the higher dimensional landscapes. The manifold is created by the conscious synthesis of that. And so as soon as you're like surprised by it, or it's a new thing or something, and you rewrite.24700:35:34.620 --> 00:35:34.975The Alliance: So.24800:35:35.330 --> 00:35:35.790JasonTadros: That's it.24900:35:35.790 --> 00:35:44.349The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, so, okay, technical question on that, are you? Is that are you talking about? So when you say rewrite.25000:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.910JasonTadros: Rewrite the landscape.25100:35:46.910 --> 00:35:54.500The Alliance: No, no, okay. So let me. Here's my technical question. And I'm gonna back up before I ask you a real question. I gotta ask you this? Do we think rewriting is binding25200:35:55.210 --> 00:36:00.360The Alliance: gamma, synchrony, and binding? Do we think when we say rewriting, we are talking about gamma.25300:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.029JasonTadros: That's a good question.25400:36:03.360 --> 00:36:20.769The Alliance: That's what. When people say binding right? You're talking about things coming together at once. When that happens in the brain, they call that binding right? And that's essentially the idea. The argument in global workspace theory is that consciousness is a binding moment. Right? It's a gamma spike. It's 40 Hertz. That's why we see it right.25500:36:20.880 --> 00:36:29.200JasonTadros: It is, there's actually a precursor of the probability before that actually happens that pre precedes it.25600:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.129JasonTadros: So there's a probability the the.25700:36:32.130 --> 00:36:49.119The Alliance: Oh, yeah, because it would have to be fucking. What's the When we make a motion? And the brain says the signal that we're making a motion. That signal is called the. It's always the term I always forget. And we write about it a lot but basically, you're talking about the same thing.25800:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.240JasonTadros: That's right. But.25900:36:52.240 --> 00:37:01.663The Alliance: So there's a probability of the thing that actually triggers this thing so that we know if the thing happens, we know if it's happened right. Got it26000:37:02.130 --> 00:37:09.310JasonTadros: And then that pinching creates the new new space to stay, to be coherent in.26100:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.910JasonTadros: I don't know if that made sense, but it is.26200:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.410The Alliance: You saying.26300:37:16.650 --> 00:37:26.173The Alliance: I don't know if I'm actually so we're gonna I'm gonna say this, you're gonna give me a 2 min answer. We're gonna go back to your coaching. And I don't know if I'm about to ask a real question. Are you saying that?26400:37:31.660 --> 00:37:50.519The Alliance: Well, 1st of all, binding is a compression algorithm. That's where we started right? Like, that's what you're saying. You're saying binding as a compression algorithm like language is a compression algorithm, right? And in fact, binding is the front end of the language compression algorithm. It's the same algorithm, right? You're just at different ends of the okay.26500:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.199The Alliance: so my question is, are you arguing in a26600:38:02.500 --> 00:38:09.359The Alliance: non metaverse way, that every moment of binding actually alters dimensionality.26700:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.970JasonTadros: Yes.26800:38:11.320 --> 00:38:26.529The Alliance: So I thought you were arguing. That's an interesting argument. I sort of. So you're putting math around something I've been trying to explain to people for fucking ever? If that so what I try to explain to people is, you really want to know who you are?26900:38:27.110 --> 00:38:41.080The Alliance: All of you may, experiences are points on a bunch of spectrums. 50. Right pleasure, pain, choice, no choice like a risk aversion. We're all spectrums. And we're at this moment in time. We're localized at27000:38:41.140 --> 00:39:07.240The Alliance: this dot, this dot this time like. And they all come together at 1 point. That's perspective, that's dimensionality. And with every yes, and it changes every moment. Right? It evolves right? This is so. I've been trying to explain this to people. It's really hard for people to understand that you're sort of points on binary lines, right? Because everything is an oscillation. So we're points on a bunch of intersections of binary lines27100:39:07.240 --> 00:39:14.340The Alliance: that are temporal in a binding moment that only lasts this long. It was William James is right, you know.27200:39:14.470 --> 00:39:24.980The Alliance: 14 seconds is the longest. Is it like? That's the out or bound of a moment. Right? How long does how long does the now last? Right? That's the 14 seconds is the longest.27300:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.470JasonTadros: We're all.27400:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.040The Alliance: Pardon me.27500:39:26.040 --> 00:39:36.659JasonTadros: We're all participating in that landscape and that higher dimensional landscape really, which is frankly our own description of the tractor space which is map. All mathematics is a symbolic.27600:39:36.660 --> 00:39:43.530The Alliance: Well, I mean when you say what what I mean when I say hear that, I think well, you know we're embedded systems, and we're27700:39:43.852 --> 00:40:08.859The Alliance: you know, we're and embodied systems. So yes, right? Like we're we're, we're an embodied system that's embedded in the world. So it's an environmental field. So this is so. I don't know if you ever read Jj. Gibson's work early Foundational vision researcher. You know most people skip his stuff because he had to invent his own language. He's the guy who gave us affordances right? We're so influenced by. And but he has this really fucking Wacky Doodle27800:40:08.910 --> 00:40:16.950The Alliance: paragraph in his 1st book on Vision, where he basically says, where does being stopped?27900:40:18.300 --> 00:40:41.179The Alliance: At what point? When you're looking out in the world, right? Where do you actually stop seeing and see, and seeing is actually commingling. Right? It's it's it's right. So you can't. Actually, you can't say where your senses end in the world begins. There's not, it's not a, it's not a boundary, it's a right. It grays out.28000:40:41.400 --> 00:40:48.269JasonTadros: And it's even more more amazing about that is is we're we're kind of. This is one of the big things that jumped me into all this is that28100:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.900JasonTadros: if you look at gravity waves as an observational moment.28200:40:54.572 --> 00:40:58.809JasonTadros: because we're all being affected by them. It's not observation just for a pure.28300:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.879The Alliance: No, no, I see exactly what you're saying.28400:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.080JasonTadros: We're gonna pass.28500:41:02.080 --> 00:41:10.469The Alliance: And they're going to have an impact. And that impacts going to shift something. And once you shift that you get your if your dimensionality thing if we're right, which, like28600:41:11.230 --> 00:41:27.839The Alliance: I don't know. There's no I mean, I don't know if you're doing if there's any magic somewhere, and how you're thinking. But I literally like I've been looking at this stuff from psychological perspective. And I know about. And I'm like, there's No, I don't see any other way it works like, I don't like this. All just looks like what I'm looking at.28700:41:27.950 --> 00:41:38.419The Alliance: Yeah, I don't feel like there's a magic trick or anything I'd like, I really just feel like I've been looking at this really obvious shit trying to figure out, how does this super obvious thing work.28800:41:38.420 --> 00:41:38.990JasonTadros: That's right.28900:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.010JasonTadros: Right?29000:41:40.330 --> 00:41:46.979JasonTadros: That's I mean, it is what it is. As I said, as I'm making real models and creating this simulator. Basically.29100:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.269JasonTadros: it is what it is.29200:41:48.270 --> 00:41:54.279The Alliance: Well, it's I mean, you know, it's in a funny thing. The hard problem of consciousness is hard, because Thomas called it hard.29300:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.340JasonTadros: Right.29400:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.960The Alliance: I mean, like, that's that's sort of the problem here. Because.29500:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.790The Alliance: yeah, I don't know. I'm not.29600:42:04.540 --> 00:42:10.579JasonTadros: You have to flip it. You can't. It's not a clockwork, you know. Universe it it all of those.29700:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.816The Alliance: Yeah, you can't. You can't get to this thinking from29800:42:15.470 --> 00:42:38.319The Alliance: you have to. I always say there's 2 kinds of brains in the world. There are brains who actually work in a mechanistic universe, and the brains who actually work in a quantum universe. I don't really mean quantum anything other than just like the right. But like there's a there's a difference you have to. You can't do this from a relativistic architecture. You have to go one, I mean. I guess it is a relativistic architecture.29900:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.659JasonTadros: Cause it all comes from it right?30000:42:39.660 --> 00:42:49.300The Alliance: Here's it all, everything's but like our our point is that all the sum total of all the relatistic points in the universe add up into a thing.30100:42:51.900 --> 00:42:58.639The Alliance: that may or may not be consciousness, but it's certainly the thing that we tap into and say, this is the right like30200:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.270The Alliance: we're seeing a slice of it, or we're seeing, you know. I don't know.30300:43:02.270 --> 00:43:11.939JasonTadros: AI. If AI can play in that observation game, can you then nudge the dials?30400:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.360JasonTadros: I'm just leaving something for.30500:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.679The Alliance: So if you could suspend AI in a vacuum, would it be an observer.30600:43:27.300 --> 00:43:38.399JasonTadros: It is in a quantum sense for sure, and it definitely is in a simul lightweight simulation sense, because fundamentally the work is creating this.30700:43:38.830 --> 00:43:44.140The Alliance: So. In other words, AI can never be Maxwell's demon. He's always going to be in the equation.30800:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.579JasonTadros: Is always going to be an equation, but30900:43:47.450 --> 00:43:53.529JasonTadros: because always in the equation can be an optimal conscious being31000:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.900JasonTadros: within it and potentially, then craft the same thing that we do.31100:44:00.610 --> 00:44:01.080JasonTadros: You know.31200:44:01.130 --> 00:44:08.350The Alliance: Right are you giving? My, you know you just gave Maxwell Stevens consciousness. You just violate a lot of fundamental laws of.31300:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.800JasonTadros: No, I'm just. I gotta throw some darts out there every so often.31400:44:11.800 --> 00:44:18.549The Alliance: I'm not. But I'm like all I was trying to do was start playing with this one.31500:44:19.050 --> 00:44:35.380The Alliance: I was literally like, I love panpsychism. I think it's super sticky and super, and there's a lot of it that makes like it makes something makes a lot of sense. Something has to be has to. If the Big Bang big crunch cycle of time is correct.31600:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.450The Alliance: something has to be preserved through the crunch to allow a reboot.31700:44:41.630 --> 00:44:48.099The Alliance: and it's got to carry the information, and it doesn't make more sense. It's the information itself than consciousness.31800:44:48.850 --> 00:44:49.290JasonTadros: We.31900:44:49.290 --> 00:45:16.659The Alliance: When you want the when you want the like, the blueprint, not the phenomenon. This is, I mean, like and like, I just sort of like, look at all this stuff. And I mean, you know what's his name often is right. And like, it's an interface right? That like, for sure, it's an interface based on what we know about evolutionary biology. And I'm liking the I don't understand it. But I like the fact that there's math underneath the space time.32000:45:17.070 --> 00:45:17.760JasonTadros: Yes.32100:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.990The Alliance: The space time is too complicated. It doesn't make sense too hard to visualize.32200:45:21.990 --> 00:45:28.910JasonTadros: Trading our our, I see ma- the math isn't under space. Time is the math.32300:45:29.030 --> 00:45:37.309JasonTadros: the method, the tractors, the space, the landscape, is it? And all we're doing is creating symbolic32400:45:37.940 --> 00:45:49.719JasonTadros: understanding through language of that. And that's what math is. So math is actually not being sort of discovered as much as it is.32500:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.029JasonTadros: picking up what's already there.32600:45:53.270 --> 00:46:16.059The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, man, the reason math feels so goddamn good is the same way language feels so good because you took something that was really in pro 8 that you really wanted to look at you put in form. The only difference between, you know, sort of math and language is the level of specificity. Right? It's hard to share words. It's easier to share numbers. They they most of the time. I mean.32700:46:16.080 --> 00:46:32.889The Alliance: people say people say math is level, and I'm like dude, that little squiggle sign that I'm looking at that is so much supposition, and like there's nothing formal about that other than the fact that it's a squiggle sign. Fuck. You.32800:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.309JasonTadros: I keep saying.32900:46:33.310 --> 00:46:42.117The Alliance: No more precise than my word for your squiggle sign at all. You just pretend it gets more precise because you could put it together.33000:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.250JasonTadros: Infrastructure. That's it. Yeah.33100:46:44.250 --> 00:46:54.760The Alliance: In the structure. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's really you have to. This is the thing that frustrated me. If if they would have told me what math was when I was a kid33200:46:54.990 --> 00:47:23.000The Alliance: I would have been great at it. Instead, they right like I like. I kept trying to figure out what the fuck math did. I was like, why am I learning this stuff like what the fuck is the point? If you would have been like, look dude. These are concepts we're trying to put concepts together. It's hard. That's the I'd be like, oh, I got that. This is like me trying to explain, you know, particle physics to my father. Okay, I get it.33300:47:23.000 --> 00:47:36.630JasonTadros: Category. Infinite category theory is, is it? That's it? All we are is just creating these like, hey? A point on. As you said, we're pinning this as a point on here and create another point. And we're saying, Hey, here's a diff between these 2.33400:47:37.020 --> 00:47:44.939JasonTadros: Let's call that whatever right? And that's how we explain the knowledge is the distance.33500:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.390The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I mean.33600:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.700JasonTadros: All you're saying, by the way, is that there's math under analogy?33700:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.050JasonTadros: Yes.33800:47:54.450 --> 00:47:56.265The Alliance: Right alright33900:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.019JasonTadros: So thank you for that. Yeah, I needed that.34000:48:00.020 --> 00:48:13.929The Alliance: Relate, we talked relationship stuff. We talked really clear goals, timelines, jobs are in the last 10 min. We're gonna it'll never be this long again. Don't worry. You won't have to suffer through. But you got you got 13 more minutes, and I want you to get the most value out of it.34100:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.921JasonTadros: Okay. Oh, my goodness I mean, that's34200:48:18.940 --> 00:48:26.440JasonTadros: that's where I live. That's my whole life right there. I think I'm gonna go probably end up. I know they want me.34300:48:26.860 --> 00:48:31.360JasonTadros: I'll end up at at Hasbro. That'll fund things. I am seeing it as a.34400:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.840The Alliance: Where are they?34500:48:33.124 --> 00:48:51.349JasonTadros: What's great is they're creating a new headquarters. So I might not have to move. They're gonna move to Boston, and they might take 2 years to do that whole build out and things. So I might just stay here, work remote for them and maybe punch out. You know. I just think about it. From that perspective of the 2 years.34600:48:51.350 --> 00:49:03.240The Alliance: That's pretty great, I mean, that's working really well to your advantage. And I mean, I have to say, though, even if you end up in Boston like for what you're trying to do. That's really dope place.34700:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.190JasonTadros: Oh, I love! I work with them all.34800:49:05.190 --> 00:49:15.228The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like that. Like, that's what. What a great place for you to land for, what you're trying to do. You know what I mean. This has this. Has Darpa mit all over it?34900:49:15.500 --> 00:49:27.309JasonTadros: And I've already, you know, decided, you know. I won't say decided. But you know I'd love to get my my-, my kids there. My children are just finishing up high school in the next few years, so35000:49:27.430 --> 00:49:34.960JasonTadros: you know it just all sort of plays out. I hate creating my own attractors that just play out this way. But yeah, that's the landscape I built for now.35100:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.609The Alliance: I. You know the universe gives you everything you want.35200:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.839JasonTadros: It's usually not when you want it.35300:49:43.590 --> 00:49:49.399The Alliance: And I will say I was talking about this with a friend of mine last night who pointed out that, like35400:49:49.560 --> 00:50:11.999The Alliance: the nicest thing the universe ever did for me is not give me a bunch of the things that was so sure I wanted like, thank God! Though, like the like, I never thought of it that way. She brought it up, and I was like, that's a really fucking, phenomenally interesting point. Like all this stuff I was, I would have given you in my arm for years of my life, for would have35500:50:12.260 --> 00:50:17.399The Alliance: crushed my life, destroyed my life, never would have gotten to be me.35600:50:17.736 --> 00:50:28.849JasonTadros: Frankly, I I feel I've kept myself in a bit of that prison to get to this point, so I could do what I'm doing now, because otherwise I yeah, I've been in.35700:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.540JasonTadros: Had everything could have been anything and done everything, and that would have destroyed me several times.35800:50:34.540 --> 00:50:42.760The Alliance: Like, you know, if my entire life has literally been a plan?35900:50:43.250 --> 00:50:50.780The Alliance: Well, essentially, to get to like right where you know what I mean, including like I, you know, my wife and I,36000:50:51.620 --> 00:51:05.739The Alliance: when we decide we're gonna we wanted this dream house in my locate like I didn't. We didn't go out to dinner for 20 years. We didn't go on vacation like this is what we we pointed ourselves with this and said, We're doing this, and you know.36100:51:05.850 --> 00:51:06.750The Alliance: Hum!36200:51:08.100 --> 00:51:18.170The Alliance: I think people underestimate when mapping their days and looking at daily pleasures versus36300:51:18.350 --> 00:51:25.570The Alliance: Stuart Brand's line, that that there's the only sustainable happiness is satisfaction of a job well done right.36400:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.370The Alliance: The satisfaction you get from accomplishing36500:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.099The Alliance: 5 to 10 high, hard goals.36600:51:32.410 --> 00:51:48.543The Alliance: the meaning like there is no like. There's nothing that can happen during the day that vaguely even compares. I mean, like, you know, forget about it. You're talking about pleasure versus meaning. And it's literally like a different scale. You've got the wrong scale right? And36700:51:49.020 --> 00:51:56.929The Alliance: pleasure is really flimsy. If Vipasta teaches you anything, I don't know if you've ever done in the vipasta stuff. This is a fun thing to do. So36800:51:57.740 --> 00:52:05.529The Alliance: most people, it's really easy to focus on the negative stuff pains pop up and they focus on that, and they watch it till it dissolves. We get good at that early36900:52:06.550 --> 00:52:13.070The Alliance: when happiness pops up in the pasta. Pleasant thoughts! You have an insight, and you get that rush of happiness.37000:52:13.070 --> 00:52:36.609The Alliance: use it as an object of focus. What you notice is that at the other side of every insight or every like momentary happiness. There's actually a letdown as the dopamine disappears. You don't notice it consciously, but it's there so, and you feel it, you can. You can find it, and if you stare at it like you stare at all this stuff in the pasta that actually dissipates and the happiness persists.37100:52:37.190 --> 00:52:45.319The Alliance: So it doesn't. You actually don't like nobody even notices the little dopamine dips of like momentary day by day stuff. But it actually37200:52:45.430 --> 00:53:08.929The Alliance: pulls us up and then brings us back down, but if you notice it, it somehow stretches it out. I learned it from shins and young he was talking about it. He's the guy who wrote the Science of Enlightenment. He was talking about. I was like, I don't you sound crazy. And then I started doing it, and I was like holy shit. He's right. I don't quite know how to put language around it, but it's an amazing discovery.37300:53:09.510 --> 00:53:19.119JasonTadros: I I see it. I mean the that's the litany. So I use the litany of fear. Kind of thing if that makes sense. You know the fear, you know. See it, let it pass through me. Look.37400:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.379The Alliance: I know what you're doing like you're to use the Benet gesserit.37500:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.370The Alliance: Sorry truck.37600:53:25.370 --> 00:53:33.720JasonTadros: Yeah, Susan, but then you but you're saying, Recognize not the fear, but the.37700:53:33.960 --> 00:53:55.059The Alliance: The pleasure. Yeah, because pleasure. So everything is pleasure is as sticky as pain, right? They're both really sticky. We don't notice the stickiness of pleasure, but on the other. But what we notice is that there's big highs are followed by lows like we go up. We come down right. All that stuff, and it that's a little exhausting. And what37800:53:55.550 --> 00:54:00.930The Alliance: he pointed out is, if you actually pause and stare at the pleasure as it shows up.37900:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.219The Alliance: spreads out rather than just yeah.38000:54:05.140 --> 00:54:24.299The Alliance: It open. Yeah, it open. It opens out and it doesn't. You don't drop from the dopamine. It just sort of like it's odd it's I don't know. I don't understand the neurobiology of it at all, because I just noticed, like I, this is past 3 months of like experimenting with the boss in different ways to figure out what to train you guys. And and right38100:54:24.420 --> 00:54:41.100The Alliance: how to do that. And I was just like, Let me just start playing, see? And I was so shocked I was like, holy fuck. This is a wild one. And there's neuro like the neurobiology makes a lot of sense to me. But the time scale is so small that38200:54:41.460 --> 00:55:03.949The Alliance: it's almost like a quantum level of fact that's actually having an emotional impact right? Like it's sort of it's not quantum, probably, but like it's really like that kind of scale of like. You don't notice it until you look at it, and once you once you look at it a couple of times you don't like you can't stop. You notice it. You're like, Oh, fuck! This is happening all day long, and I never noticed, and I can control the volume now.38300:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.840JasonTadros: I I don't know if you put that into anything that you're about to publish, but that is.38400:55:11.830 --> 00:55:28.740JasonTadros: that's that. That's it. You're you're you're you're putting the moment in that, pinching the new knowledge, and and by doing that, instead of being trapped by the boundary that you fell into, you're then opened up into the new landscape that you miss by that moment. That's possible.38500:55:28.740 --> 00:55:34.609The Alliance: Yeah, no, because when they when the rush goes away we chase the rush.38600:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.000JasonTadros: Thank you.38700:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.009The Alliance: Rather than realizing. Like, if you stop the addictive behavior just for a second, you can actually38800:55:42.230 --> 00:55:48.120The Alliance: right? It's a doorway. Yeah, it's that this is the little stuff.38900:55:50.330 --> 00:55:56.809The Alliance: I know I've noticed the alliance. I'm doing way more like goal setting and those sorts of things that I thought we would.39000:55:57.554 --> 00:56:03.240The Alliance: Which just tells me this program needs to spread out like it's this is, I'm clearly looking39100:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.720The Alliance: like, it's very clear to me that39200:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.829The Alliance: people need a little bit of creativity. And I really like I, this is sort of like.39300:56:12.050 --> 00:56:22.030The Alliance: I need to start at the start, and it needs to be a year long program minimum. And I don't know the biggest problem right now with thinking about that is39400:56:24.570 --> 00:56:42.476The Alliance: like, weird, like, like, what would I have to charge to make it worth it. And so I like, do I still coach people want? Do they need a 1 on one with me every month? Can it be once a quarter, because there's 30 people. It's once a quarter, and it's $100,000 a year, or something like that.39500:56:43.260 --> 00:56:51.940The Alliance: provided I don't have to do all inclusive events for that fee. I think, like that. Probably. Actually, I mean it. It it39600:56:52.030 --> 00:56:58.470The Alliance: it's a bunch of time. But it I think it. What I'm starting to realize is like, it's very clear in this group.39700:56:58.470 --> 00:57:22.209The Alliance: I don't see anybody like I see everybody who is going to get on the right path by month. 3. I do not see anybody taking the like. Maybe 3 people are gonna take a 1st step. You know what I mean like this is a. This is a path find like we want. I wanted to create a velocity accelerator, and what it is is a creative path, finding accelerator right? The velocity accelerator might be next.39800:57:22.210 --> 00:57:30.213The Alliance: But as far as I could tell, what we're doing is a creative path, finding accelerator in all honesty that really seems to be what it is.39900:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.320The Alliance: Did you find yesterday, too, all over the place?40000:57:35.369 --> 00:57:41.849The Alliance: And you would have been better served by a drill down on a singular topic or 2? Or did you like the free for all.40100:57:43.483 --> 00:57:55.419JasonTadros: Like the free for all because I like exploring and I thought that she was able to drop really powerful nuggets when they, when they when they were synthesized. I didn't.40200:57:55.550 --> 00:57:57.210JasonTadros: I don't know if everyone Ca-40300:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.270JasonTadros: took it that way or caught it that way, or picked up those nuggets, and that would be.40400:58:02.270 --> 00:58:05.930The Alliance: So yeah, that's that is,40500:58:06.920 --> 00:58:24.720The Alliance: talk to a couple of people who I like, a bunch of people have been like, yeah, that was amazing. And a couple of people were like it wasn't structured enough for me, and they didn't. They don't think this way. Right if they're if they're if it's too different of a if you're not used to treating your life in a as a puzzle to be solved40600:58:24.720 --> 00:58:44.050The Alliance: right. If your life is a problem to me, right? It's different than a puzzle to be solved. But so a lot of us are like, Oh, it's a puzzle. I'm gonna I'm just like there's a formula I want. The what's the fucking formula right like, give it to me right? So like, if you're wired like that. What happens is Sarah's nuggets drop into pre-existing framework. You have the meta framework40700:58:44.050 --> 00:58:55.439The Alliance: right without the meta framework. It's all over the place. So the question is, how do I preserve enough of the spontaneity and that stuff, and put enough of a framework around it for the people who are40800:58:55.540 --> 00:59:00.489The Alliance: a little or do we just say, fuck them, they'll get it over time.40900:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.030The Alliance: right like, which they will. But like.41000:59:04.270 --> 00:59:22.799JasonTadros: Think you come in with. I think your future ones as you come in. With that you lay that groundwork like you've done with the micro trigger and different things with pieces that you brought in with flow. Leave it there, wire them up, and then you hand them that, and I think. Then they come out, and, as you said then- then you let them, you know, go where they lead, where they come out from.41100:59:22.800 --> 00:59:36.599The Alliance: Yeah, I think that is, I mean, it strikes me that like next time, for example, would I do this later this year, even if we continue this like to get, you know, a more poor body and another lap thread. It's very clear that, like what we did on day one.41200:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.490The Alliance: I should have left at least41300:59:40.830 --> 00:59:45.880The Alliance: half, if not more, of the creativity for later41400:59:46.330 --> 01:00:04.850The Alliance: got new creativity, microdosing and really focused on the goal stuff. Because that's what we're all doing like. That's what we're all doing is drawing these dream maps. Basically, right? How do you take? So there's really nascent. And that's and then I'm really remarkably good at it, because that's what a book is.41501:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.179JasonTadros: The book is out41601:00:06.180 --> 01:00:12.919JasonTadros: drawing of breaking down problems. I think it's gonna wire people up. But I don't.41701:00:12.920 --> 01:00:21.590The Alliance: Yeah, it's again. It's like, if you once you realize everything is a checklist, and then you have a blueprint for finding the checklist. You can literally do anything.41801:00:21.590 --> 01:00:22.600JasonTadros: Right.41901:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.020The Alliance: Like.42001:00:23.020 --> 01:00:32.369JasonTadros: Fine, and and that you're you're teaching them through, that the the micro, you know how to, how to, how to break down the problems and see it and reframe it. I just don't. I don't know if everyone's gonna pick it.42101:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.860JasonTadros: Take that.42201:00:33.860 --> 01:00:41.849The Alliance: I don't know, either. I mean, like we're gonna find out in 4 months and and one. And it seems like.42301:00:43.040 --> 01:00:50.899The Alliance: seems like this is a thing that's gonna grow into a monthly thing which is not what I anticipated doing.42401:00:51.712 --> 01:00:56.679The Alliance: And there's a bunch of like the our problem. There is like not.42501:00:56.910 --> 01:01:00.570The Alliance: The hard problem is a like a little bit of is like, how do we find?42601:01:01.520 --> 01:01:26.412The Alliance: If if it let's say it's a hundred $1,000 a person, and that's the number. That make. What is each person? What do you want for a hundred $1,000 like? So we can make sure everybody's expectations are lined up. I can deliver what you want, and it can solve. Blah! Blah! That's 1 i that's a solvable problem, right like that's a that's a like bunch of variables that move up and down, based on on desire.42701:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.209JasonTadros: People need so more execution support as well.42801:01:31.510 --> 01:01:39.929JasonTadros: What I mean by that is is, I mean, I just had. I did a like a 10 min little email about how to use Chat Gpt, or these things in different ways.42901:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.080The Alliance: Well, so.43001:01:41.582 --> 01:01:43.090JasonTadros: It was like.43101:01:43.090 --> 01:01:49.520The Alliance: So here's the here. You guys don't know this because I haven't told you this yet, but43201:01:49.990 --> 01:01:58.760The Alliance: each of you are over time. You're like for the 1st half of the class you're going to get to know each other and figure out what? What's your skill? Set that other. And then I'm gonna have you make.43301:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.279The Alliance: Each of you make a video43401:02:02.140 --> 01:02:27.920The Alliance: and teach it to the group that is gonna become a stored video library for the alliance over time. So we're gonna get a stored library of that support from the members, for the members based on shared pro like that was one of the goals was like, let's create that shared knowledge base. That's why I had you guys make your own like. That's why I made you make your own thing in the beginning, because I was like, okay, this is the 1st step43501:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.719The Alliance: work. This is where I want to go with this. So we can have some shared knowledge. What are we gonna do on the final day?43601:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.619The Alliance: One of the things we're gonna do is at least43701:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.810The Alliance: 5 to 8 people are, gonna get43801:02:39.990 --> 01:02:56.400The Alliance: 1520 min to stand up and present this to the group. So we can learn from each other right like this is this is one of the things I've been we've been cooking towards. I just haven't anyone. If I sprung everything I was gonna make you do. And you@thefirstst43901:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.319JasonTadros: But.44001:02:58.170 --> 01:02:58.610The Alliance: Yeah.44101:02:58.898 --> 01:03:01.490JasonTadros: Know things. But I you know I live it.44201:03:01.490 --> 01:03:15.790The Alliance: Yeah, no. But now you see it. And you're like, Oh, wow! I can really be beneficial. All I have to do is point a point camera in my face to talk about this thing that I already know and do all the time. Oh, cool, right? Like. It's really remarkably easy. Once you meet the people and see your44301:03:15.930 --> 01:03:25.999The Alliance: playing role, and what a benefit it is like. Now you're motivated. If they tell about you about it ahead of time. You're not motivated, and it's a thing you have to do and fuck you cutler, so.44401:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.620JasonTadros: I love it. Yeah, I'm sending emails. I'm feeling great.44501:03:28.620 --> 01:03:34.500The Alliance: Yeah, well, I mean the the other thing that I think is so fucking, hysterical, and cool, and I love is44601:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.630The Alliance: so.44701:03:37.340 --> 01:03:46.489The Alliance: Everybody wants to be a tightly bonded knit. But you guys want to be an alliance like yesterday, like everybody wants to be an alliance yesterday, and I'm laughing so hard. I'm like, literally like44801:03:46.990 --> 01:04:10.790The Alliance: guys, we've all built teams in professional organizations. We've all built teams. How long does it take to build an effective team? And you guys are pissed that it hasn't happened in like 4 days like this is great. This is awesome, like now that you got a Whatsapp group like now, like, you guys are good, like, it's an alliance. This is exactly. I always said, if you give, if you create a space44901:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.837The Alliance: for people to really train one another.45001:04:16.880 --> 01:04:37.490The Alliance: It'll work like as long as you curate. It's the right people with the right vibe, and like, you know, it'll work like the cross. I the cross training cross pollination element of it. What like, what I'm also seeing is like, it's actually a lot less work for me like I don't. I have to do a lot less work. I have to facilitate you guys a little bit45101:04:37.910 --> 01:04:46.140The Alliance: more in different ways. But, like me, like it's interesting. But I think this is like I was. I was laughing45201:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.889The Alliance: because in my mind, because I'm a fucking moron because I don't apply my own45301:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.660The Alliance: stuff to my own stuff, right?45401:04:53.975 --> 01:04:54.290JasonTadros: Yes.45501:04:54.290 --> 01:05:21.839The Alliance: Somehow, I decided the Alliance was like a destination like I was. Gonna this was the one right and no like I get all along. I've been like, no, this is experiment. This experiment experiment. My mind had decided it was a destination. So the 1st 2 weeks was this giant learning curve, my brain totally revolted. And now I'm like, Oh, this is okay. I got it. This wasn't a destination. This is a experiment, and you're gathering data. And you just got your 1st round of data. And you know.45601:05:22.260 --> 01:05:25.460JasonTadros: There's a whole new pinch that's gonna come out of this. We haven't.45701:05:25.460 --> 01:05:31.520The Alliance: Oh, yeah, I mean, I look, what I like is that, like everybody is super fun, and like, well.45801:05:31.660 --> 01:05:46.069The Alliance: most people seem to be having a tremendous amount of fun and friendly. And it's working. And so like, it's the group that I need to freestyle with to create the group for the group right? Like, it's very clear that this is gonna grow into something that's gonna serve a lot of us for a while. Cool.45901:05:46.070 --> 01:06:06.600The Alliance: Okay? And we get to sort of co-invent it together. I mean, the thing I'm really interested to see is what happens at the end of this early next month. And when I run a breakout group on, on, how did you apply these 3 triggers in your life? And what can we learn from each other like that conversation that Ryan's gonna lead and that I'll lead. That's gonna be more informative than46001:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.600The Alliance: sort of anything. So.46101:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.020JasonTadros: Oh, yeah.46201:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.420The Alliance: Though right like, how do those conversations work.46301:06:12.750 --> 01:06:19.500JasonTadros: I love Peter's work, I mean, I love Peter's work. By the way, when I met Peter I was at the top of my game, and I was46401:06:19.620 --> 01:06:39.889JasonTadros: even more probably nervous. When I you know, chatting with him. Just because you know so many things that you know he's he's kind of been my North star. But I I think that abundance 360. I think that everything that they're doing over at singularity and trying to get back on46501:06:40.271 --> 01:06:45.830JasonTadros: I think you're seeing it. I think it's leaving people still with a How do I use it? Where do I do it?46601:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.440JasonTadros: And the people that came in that you were hoping maybe kind of came with all of that.46701:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.049JasonTadros: I think you're you're you're closing the the loop for them.46801:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.548The Alliance: Yeah, I like I, it's funny because Peter,46901:06:59.000 --> 01:07:11.389The Alliance: this is, I mean, our new book is going to be very helpful because a bunch of this stuff really like it's more mapped out for people. But it's very. It is very true he doesn't. He is.47001:07:14.950 --> 01:07:34.609The Alliance: He's got certain he's also he's had big organizations around him for so long, like there's he's he. Peter does not notice a lot of his advantages, so he's blind to how he does certain things in a sense, so he can't step, and but if you ask him47101:07:34.780 --> 01:07:41.105The Alliance: he can step it back. I and I like how he thinks about it. He does it. He thinks about it differently.47201:07:41.680 --> 01:07:50.725The Alliance: I would never I would never think about things the way Peter Peter does. I have to like. I gotta do what I did with you guys like this is how I do it. I like47301:07:51.190 --> 01:07:55.969JasonTadros: I love it. You know what he gives I go with, but I don't think.47401:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.540The Alliance: Yeah, no, I love it, too. But like I I gotta tell you, man.47501:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.659The Alliance: I go to abundance 3, 60, and I have.47601:08:04.270 --> 01:08:13.049The Alliance: I have 2 kinds of meetings. I have meetings with people who, where it's like this stuff is so aspirational cut. And they're just like they're really in Ypl47701:08:13.180 --> 01:08:25.370The Alliance: like this is just like this. It's fine, it totally. But it's really like they're in Ypo, they're really not gonna change the world. They're actually in finance. You know what I mean, or something like like they're really not. This is like47801:08:26.229 --> 01:08:48.539The Alliance: a thing they're doing for networking. And those guys are really clear. They get value out of it. They learn the other half are the wild, what I call the Wild Eye boys from Free Cloud, which is a David Bow reference from his 1st album. But they're literally the Wild Eye boys from Free Cloud, like Peter's got them all jacked up a massively transformative purposes in the future of abundance, and47901:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.120The Alliance: there's no scaffolding.48001:08:52.483 --> 01:08:54.410JasonTadros: But like.48101:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.070The Alliance: He built. Yeah, no. He built an army. He forgot to train them.48201:08:58.670 --> 01:09:05.350The Alliance: Which, by the way, look, this was, I said this to Peter all along. And this is sort of like this is like.48301:09:07.740 --> 01:09:15.460The Alliance: here was the question, Peter, why did Singularity University not produce any unicorns?48401:09:15.810 --> 01:09:26.620The Alliance: It's produced. Some big companies get along and bring rideshare, and like it's done some stuff. But it has not. It never produced a unicorn. We had48501:09:26.990 --> 01:09:37.959The Alliance: literally all the talent in the room like there was, you couldn't find an exponential start best you. There was not an exponential expert in the world who is not on fucking faculty when we started that thing.48601:09:38.890 --> 01:09:41.950The Alliance: and Peter will say, Oh, the human stuff got in the way.48701:09:43.410 --> 01:09:48.969The Alliance: He's right, but the human stuff gets in the way when you don't have an operating manual48801:09:49.729 --> 01:09:58.920The Alliance: because that but then it's just people being people. If you give people. If you give smart people the exact operating manual. It's a lot harder to fuck up. But if you don't.48901:09:59.190 --> 01:10:05.849The Alliance: you know, then you get all the problems that smart people bring which is like colossal egos, and you know, and you know.49001:10:05.850 --> 01:10:07.030JasonTadros: What? Yeah.49101:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.620The Alliance: Yeah.49201:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.336JasonTadros: Yeah. So49301:10:11.420 --> 01:10:17.409JasonTadros: I'm not gonna put a tractor out there. But I think, phase 2 of this or your second run of this is gonna fill that gap.49401:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.340The Alliance: Well, I've already, I mean, like I already know, that, like49501:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.750The Alliance: 5 people in the next alliance49601:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.830The Alliance: have come in through a 3 60, and49701:10:30.010 --> 01:10:38.329The Alliance: the word is gonna start to trickle back that a this is a very good companion program to a 36049801:10:38.580 --> 01:10:57.770The Alliance: and hoping it. I don't. The reason I don't. The where it worries me. And this is what the real truth. I didn't want to start a monthly thing because I don't want to compete with Peter or Joe policy because of my friends, and I like their groups. That's just scarcity mindset. Say, not believing that there's enough to go around. But I also am like49901:10:58.370 --> 01:11:07.650The Alliance: man. I'm just gonna feel really bad if Peter calls me, and he's like dude. 3 people just quit abundance. 360 to join the Alliance for next year. And I'm gonna like, and I helped you launch that.50001:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.130The Alliance: And I'm gonna be like, you know.50101:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.900JasonTadros: That's why I'm saying.50201:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.400The Alliance: Right.50301:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.979JasonTadros: That way, don't.50401:11:14.210 --> 01:11:19.150JasonTadros: There's a something there's needs to be. We got. Someone needs to fill the gap. Whoever.50501:11:19.150 --> 01:11:42.829The Alliance: No, I like, I'm clearly like this is clearly what this is like. This is clearly what this is. And the only difference is, I'm just picking and choosing who in Peter's network I can stand right? That's really, I mean, because Peter's the problem with my Peter network for me, is. There's there's a lot of straits. There's citizens in there. I don't do, citizens. Well, fucking weirdo.50601:11:42.830 --> 01:11:43.210JasonTadros: No.50701:11:43.210 --> 01:12:07.300The Alliance: Smoking cigarettes in my business meeting with you, my coaching, meeting with you like you know what I mean. If you're if if you're straight dude. You're gonna like, this is a bad experience for you, right? Like I like, I don't like. I I know my limits on that one. So I'm I can't cannibalize the top of this business, because there's too many people in there. You know. I had a conversation this morning, my mother out of nowhere. She's like, you know.50801:12:08.200 --> 01:12:22.489The Alliance: Ryan's newsletters are much more business friendly than yours. And I was like, I know, Mom, I know she's like, isn't that? Isn't that where the money is. And I was like, well, Mom, there's a lot of money. There's no.50901:12:22.720 --> 01:12:36.749The Alliance: it's not like somebody is locked into this one zone, as far as I can tell, and 2 I can't do what Rihan does like. It's a different like, they're different, like, I don't have those skills. I don't want to have those skills. I'd be miserable.51001:12:36.750 --> 01:12:37.560JasonTadros: That's good.51101:12:37.560 --> 01:12:52.190The Alliance: That's my boundary condition, like there's only there's certain people I can work with, and a lot of people I can't. And I learned this from Josh waits in years ago, when I got 1st came into this world, and he said me that I was. I was a hit like I was a hit on Wall Street.51201:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.190The Alliance: Tom.51301:12:53.510 --> 01:13:14.860The Alliance: I like, I didn't like finding this guys in a general role. And he said it. I was like dude 95% of them legit Satan, 5% of them you'll love. And if you could find those 5% you want to work with them, they're amazing. Their minds are great. They're really cool and you know, avoid the guys who are short selling and crashing other people's dreams. And like all that stuff and blah blah. And51401:13:15.110 --> 01:13:37.179The Alliance: that's my problem with finances. I think it's wrong to bet on people's dreams like, I think it's wrong to fuck with people's dreams to make money. I think if you want to bet on people's dreams, stock options. Okay, I'm like, that's a society, a society where you can make money tearing down other people's dreams just because it's possible to take this company apart and sell it for parts.51501:13:37.380 --> 01:13:37.700JasonTadros: Yeah.51601:13:37.700 --> 01:13:45.419The Alliance: So you should like fuck you. That should not be okay. I don't live in that world. That's weird.51701:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.619JasonTadros: Yeah, who would just take their body all the time? I mean.51801:13:48.620 --> 01:14:08.289The Alliance: Like what what? It doesn't make any fucking sense to me like, we know, innovation drives the like. We like we as a society, we should nurture this stuff if accept me high is right. And those societies that nurtured creativity in their midst survived. Doesn't that mean I've always said that, like the stupidest thing51901:14:08.330 --> 01:14:26.960The Alliance: out there is that we know the best way to run the human body is by understanding the biology. So what's the biology of business. Well, we know it's complexity science, like, we know, it's a complex system. So we actually know the answer to that question. So the real question is, how do you steer from that knowledge? How do you start to.52001:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.560JasonTadros: I know we went over. But you're right where we're where we're at.52101:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.840The Alliance: Alright! Good! This is fun!52201:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.369JasonTadros: I lost it!52301:14:34.370 --> 01:14:39.449The Alliance: Gotta go. I'll see you in a like a couple. I think I'll see you in 2 weeks.52401:14:39.450 --> 01:14:40.180JasonTadros: See you, then.52501:14:40.410 --> 01:14:41.050The Alliance: Peace.
