WEBVTT100:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.879The Alliance: Test, 2, 3.200:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.730Geoffrey Garth: Okay.300:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.209The Alliance: That work. I've got you clear.400:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.600Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, pretty much.500:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510Geoffrey Garth: You're not saying anything, so it's hard to tell.600:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.540The Alliance: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want me to just keep talking? Is it working now? Is it working now? It's not too annoying, is it?700:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.499Geoffrey Garth: Can you hear me now? Yeah, no, I think we're we're this is much better.800:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.716The Alliance: Okay, cool900:01:32.570 --> 00:01:42.930The Alliance: So I wanna this is sort of your time to focus on on wherever you want it to go. But as a as a way to kick us off.1000:01:43.990 --> 00:02:12.220The Alliance: You know me, I my, I tend to fire hose information at people. And one of the reasons I like to do that is, I think that what lights people up and what really sticks with them like a couple of weeks later is always a really telling sign, a good point to start, and it it certainly amplifies learning, cause you've already. So what caught you? Anything in in our time together. Catch you? Has it been immediately actionable? Have you1100:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.840The Alliance: taking the bull by the horns? Any of those things.1200:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.803Geoffrey Garth: Well, the1300:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.959Geoffrey Garth: The information I felt like was.1400:02:27.190 --> 00:02:43.850Geoffrey Garth: you know, pretty much all known to me, I mean the nitty gritty of the the chemistry. You know. Sounds like, maybe things have come along a bit, and I was interested to see the paper that you and Michael had done but1500:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.590Geoffrey Garth: you know it it.1600:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.933Geoffrey Garth: I didn't feel like I was getting really new information, and I was1700:02:51.820 --> 00:03:01.419Geoffrey Garth: I was a little surprised, I guess, to realize that, and maybe I'm wrong, but that everybody had been in 0 to dangerous. Is that accurate.1800:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.470The Alliance: Now I want to say, well, there are.1900:03:09.820 --> 00:03:30.125The Alliance: It was like 5 people I want to see who's never trained with me before, so they've taken nothing. But a couple of them were not in the room, so Rick Watkins, a couple of other people weren't in the room and no, the the people had taken. People had taken something flow for right. A couple of those people had taken flow for writers.2000:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.080Geoffrey Garth: Okay.2100:03:31.280 --> 00:03:41.810The Alliance: Had full been taken seriously dangerous bunch of them had just taken our coaching certification. So people are sort of all over the place in terms of where they were coming from.2200:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.635Geoffrey Garth: Okay? Well, the2300:03:48.680 --> 00:04:01.270Geoffrey Garth: What what struck me about the day up there was the have the conversations with with2400:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.179Geoffrey Garth: with the AI guys.2500:04:06.086 --> 00:04:09.629Geoffrey Garth: And that was that was just2600:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.392Geoffrey Garth: they were operating. They were talking at a level that was so far over my head. That2700:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.491Geoffrey Garth: you know I had really2800:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.860Geoffrey Garth: I had to work to keep up with it.2900:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.280Geoffrey Garth: which you know usually. Well, you know, I've been finding that3000:04:29.580 --> 00:04:53.113Geoffrey Garth: to be the case in some situations, I don't know whether it's just that I'm getting older, but I'll read some article and I'll read some sentence in the article, and it just doesn't make any sense to me. And I'm going like this is published in a journal or in a magazine or something. It must make sense, but it doesn't make any sense to me. And at some point I just like, well, you know, get on to the next thing. So3100:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.742Geoffrey Garth: I don't know.3200:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.685Geoffrey Garth: I'm3300:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.230Geoffrey Garth: I my my big.3400:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.230Geoffrey Garth: My interest in getting involved was to what it's always been was to, you know, meet new people and try and see if there were3500:05:13.550 --> 00:05:28.949Geoffrey Garth: things that would get prompted for me in terms of you know, product ideas, because that's what I feel like. I'm sort of missing in in my life right now, and while, you know, retiring, being retired has some good parts about it.3600:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.070Geoffrey Garth: I really miss the intellectual side of product development?3700:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.588Geoffrey Garth: So yeah, I didn't. I didn't feel like3800:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.853Geoffrey Garth: The information you were providing.3900:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.224Geoffrey Garth: was particularly helpful in in that area. But4000:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.019Geoffrey Garth: I continue to have my fingers crossed.4100:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.500The Alliance: Why do you feel that way.4200:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.459Geoffrey Garth: Why do I feel.4300:05:57.460 --> 00:06:13.019The Alliance: Yeah, I mean that that's that's interesting, because everything we were talking about was how to generate new ideas. And you were surrounded by a group full of new people. And I saw you. You were interacting and you were laughing and you were engaged in conversation. So I'm not. I'm4400:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.469The Alliance: like those are all the ingredients in innovation, correct.4500:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.429Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, yeah. Well, the the issue for me is having a need is identifying a need.4600:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.003Geoffrey Garth: And you know, you call a massively transformative4700:06:32.670 --> 00:06:46.340Geoffrey Garth: goal. But you know for me it kind of well. And then I started asking myself, well, maybe you should be trying to, you know, prevent another lost generation from the AI. That's coming.4800:06:46.821 --> 00:06:53.490Geoffrey Garth: I think a couple of people mentioned that. And I was like, well, that's a worthwhile goal. But4900:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.160Geoffrey Garth: kind of didn't resonate for me because it didn't feel like it.5000:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.179Geoffrey Garth: It played to my skills, you know.5100:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.930Geoffrey Garth: So that's the the issue for me is is identifying a need that5200:07:10.022 --> 00:07:13.039Geoffrey Garth: aligned with with my skill set.5300:07:13.970 --> 00:07:24.060Geoffrey Garth: which is kind of hands on physical stuff, that I can go down into my shop and and invent, you know. So I designed a piece of furniture the other day, and it just got delivered. It was.5400:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.420Geoffrey Garth: you know, that was really satisfying.5500:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.580Geoffrey Garth: But you know that was independent of of the Alliance.5600:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.585The Alliance: So.5700:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.329The Alliance: that's that's awesome. I mean, that's so. Let me ask you. Let me ask you a question.5800:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.920The Alliance: The I mean, this sounds like5900:07:48.100 --> 00:08:12.399The Alliance: this is, in a sense, a goal setting problem. Right? The tools, the tools. Right? Yeah. I mean, in a sense, like we. And and by the way, you're giving us great boundary conditions right from an engineering perspective. These are some great boundary conditions. One you sort of like. You don't have to worry about that. You're looking for a mission level thing. To really capture your attention right? And.6000:08:12.400 --> 00:08:12.970Geoffrey Garth: Right.6100:08:12.970 --> 00:08:38.320The Alliance: You want it to incorrectly so like brilliant, because I can't tell you how many times this week I've had to teach this to people that you want it to be able to filter through who you are, what your talents are, what your life is, what you like to do right, which you have to do otherwise you end up. You know people. I say this all the time people have this mistaken impression that once they find a massively transformative purpose. They're going to become a different person.6200:08:38.799 --> 00:08:51.860The Alliance: And that doesn't happen at all. Right. We're just the same people, with with a bigger mission. But I like the the passion recipe is literally developed to do this. It says, look, start with6300:08:51.990 --> 00:09:17.830The Alliance: 25 things you're curious about, and start hunting. The intersection of curiosities and playing there just a little bit over time and over time, because a single curiosity, as you pointed out, doesn't have enough juice for you. But if you can find 3 or 4 places where your curiosity intersect and then bump into a major problem in the world like the AI uprising. Now, you're really cooking with fire.6400:09:17.920 --> 00:09:41.780The Alliance: That's a stand, you know. That's a that's that's sort of what the passion recipe is designed to do is just give you away. Give you a framework for that, and you know, with Chat Gbt. And all the other Llms. Helping us find, you know, to convergent thinking between things. It's a lot easier to find the nexus of curiosities. Have you done those kinds of exercises before.6500:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.220Geoffrey Garth: Well, you know, as you say, that I feel a little bad because6600:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.409Geoffrey Garth: I did it when I read.6700:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.550Geoffrey Garth: I guess it was in6800:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.160The Alliance: Are impossible. 1st time I laid it out.6900:09:54.160 --> 00:10:09.430Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, yeah, and and I, I did a little bit of it then, and then you talked about doing it again now, and I have not, so I will go back and and diligently apply myself to to that.7000:10:09.430 --> 00:10:29.683The Alliance: Let me let me just walk you through a couple of things that I think are really important here, because you'll get this immediately, and it'll track well for you. What you're looking for is just, you know, start by like 25 curiosities like, if I if I could stop timing at a free week. I could learn this, you know, I'd go to 10 lectures. I'd watch 5 videos. I'd read 6 books, whatever right about this thing.7100:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.360Geoffrey Garth: Right.7200:10:30.360 --> 00:10:41.139The Alliance: And just start hunting the intersection of a couple of them. And when you find an intersection play there, do some research. If that research is leading to more questions.7300:10:41.150 --> 00:11:03.260The Alliance: Fantastic right now you're now. It's right. If it's if you're running out of questions, that's not sexy, look for a different connection play there right? Once you start finding like places where it's actually 2 or 3 things. See if you could turn it into a tinkering project in your lab of some kind just to play. This is all experimental. The problem people run the passion recipe is they think it's gonna work7400:11:03.260 --> 00:11:25.859The Alliance: like in 2 weeks. I maybe it can for somebody. I've not seen that. You know what I mean. I do this all the time when I need a new direction, or I need a book idea, or whatever in my experience, it's a 4 to 8 month sort of process to really get to a purpose that you can sink your teeth into deeply. That's that's me. But that's been my experience with it. But I like it seems like that.7500:11:26.204 --> 00:11:47.289The Alliance: Cause what you you know you start by the the 1st Level is like, you know. Just look for the intersections of curiosities. All that stuff. Once you map that onto a purpose. The next filter is your life. This is who I am. This is what I do. This is how I can make the difference. I want to make kind of thing, and once you have that map you got a pretty good direction of where to go next, and hopefully7600:11:47.490 --> 00:11:55.140The Alliance: it'll have like some, you know hopefully, you'll be able to go into your basement and tinker along the way, and it'll be, you know, you'll find fulfilling puzzles.7700:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.250Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.7800:11:58.970 --> 00:12:06.449Geoffrey Garth: Yeah. Well, that sounds really good. And I'm gonna I'm gonna work on it.7900:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.859Geoffrey Garth: Go ahead.8000:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.130The Alliance: No, you go ahead. Go ahead. It's interesting.8100:12:18.022 --> 00:12:22.846Geoffrey Garth: I was you know. I came back from the8200:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.589Geoffrey Garth: from the session, and it was like.8300:12:26.720 --> 00:12:42.959Geoffrey Garth: What what are you gonna do here what we you know. I I had a little bit of trouble getting into the vault of things, and it was like I was somewhat expecting more direction. Do this, do that. Spend 20, you know. The only thing I saw really was.8400:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.180Geoffrey Garth: you know. Do8500:12:44.370 --> 00:12:52.519Geoffrey Garth: try drawing, and you know I I spent a few minutes doing that. But you know there's a part of me that's like I know how to draw.8600:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.426Geoffrey Garth: you know. But I that's not kind of the point. So8700:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.305The Alliance: Well, so so, Jeff, I will. So to me it's 2 things so like8800:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.679The Alliance: the the I what I wanted to do8900:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.970The Alliance: there was, give you the full menu of tools to apply to the problem9000:13:13.220 --> 00:13:39.632The Alliance: on these one, on one calls I wanted to 0 in on, hey? I think these are the tool. That's why I was asking what? Stuck in what didn't, and it seems like the password recipe is the clear next step for you. Simultaneously. You said something so interesting. It just caught me, which is identifying a need that you can. You can make a difference to. And the need is, I mean, there's, you know, there's a million needs in the world.9100:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.670The Alliance: your ability to make a difference is interesting, because my question is like.9200:13:46.160 --> 00:13:56.179The Alliance: where does that process stop for you? Do you want to be the inventor of the technology? Do you want to be the guy who builds the business around and brings it to scale. Do you like? Where do you play in that.9300:13:57.820 --> 00:14:04.380Geoffrey Garth: Right, you know I thought a bit about how it?9400:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.869Geoffrey Garth: Well, you talked about it. Do I have the energy at 50, something to start another company.9500:14:10.220 --> 00:14:16.300Geoffrey Garth: And I've asked myself the question. You know, yeah, the energy at 72 to.9600:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.909Geoffrey Garth: you know, start another company. And it's like.9700:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.394Geoffrey Garth: well, if it was really, really, really compelling.9800:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.419Geoffrey Garth: you know, the way I started the 1st company was, I just did everything. I mean.9900:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.629Geoffrey Garth: it was the quintessential Bootstrap, so I wouldn't do it that way.10000:14:34.630 --> 00:14:40.449The Alliance: Are you talking about the the brace? You really did do everything, man, you were like the ultimate one man shop.10100:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.329Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, so you know, were I to do it now, I would.10200:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.890Geoffrey Garth: you know, bring on some team members, you know, way earlier, and you know but10300:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.949Geoffrey Garth: But I had this idea the other day the young kid10400:14:57.090 --> 00:15:02.710Geoffrey Garth: showed up in my life the other day, and from India, who's like 22. And10500:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.900Geoffrey Garth: he he! He made an Etsy10600:15:06.130 --> 00:15:14.589Geoffrey Garth: for people in India to sell their stuff online and sold the business for high 6 figures when he was 19,10700:15:15.210 --> 00:15:21.380Geoffrey Garth: and now he's over here, and he showed me this 5th10800:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.080Geoffrey Garth: app, that is, a patent.10900:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.480Geoffrey Garth: Excuse me a patenting app.11000:15:28.210 --> 00:15:33.519Geoffrey Garth: and so you go in there and you give it the idea. And it just11100:15:33.880 --> 00:15:39.249Geoffrey Garth: starts prompting you and asking you questions. And pretty soon it's crafted claims.11200:15:40.160 --> 00:15:48.211Geoffrey Garth: And I, yeah, I I was pretty wowed by it, too. But my sense is that11300:15:49.321 --> 00:16:01.688Geoffrey Garth: Jason would be like, well, sure, no, no problem. I mean. That's you know, that's been known, you know. I could have done that 10 years ago. Sort of thing. But I really like Jason, but he was so far out. But11400:16:02.410 --> 00:16:10.449Geoffrey Garth: I so I I had this idea the other day because I got this new faucet for my sink, and11500:16:10.880 --> 00:16:23.230Geoffrey Garth: it's really hard to titrate the amount of water that comes out. It's got this throw on the on the lever that's about 3 inches long, but only about a half of inch is actuated.11600:16:23.490 --> 00:16:34.429Geoffrey Garth: you know. I mean the the last 2 inches. It's been on full already. So there, you know. But to try and get it just enough water to come out11700:16:35.024 --> 00:16:52.079Geoffrey Garth: to wash your hands and not be spraying all over every place. And so the thought occurred to me. Well, you know saving water is a big deal, and it's not a this wouldn't save a whole lot of water. But why not have a faucet that has a 2,11800:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.610Geoffrey Garth: 2 2 flow rates, you know, one that's11900:16:56.810 --> 00:17:03.500Geoffrey Garth: designed to be small enough to, you know, large enough to wash your hands, but no more than that.12000:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.389Geoffrey Garth: and then the other one would be full, and you could have.12100:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.349Geoffrey Garth: you know, adjustment in in the full one. But you could, you know. So I.12200:17:12.359 --> 00:17:34.529The Alliance: I don't. I don't know if we're saving the world here, but I gotta tell you that's a crazy good idea. I mean, it was a toilet revolution right like, if it doesn't exist yet in the world like that's going to exist sometime in the next couple of years, because it's like. It's right there. It's 1 of those good inventions that you know. It's fucking obvious. And you're sort of like, wow! Why am I the 1st person who thought of this? That's cool.12300:17:34.800 --> 00:17:46.920Geoffrey Garth: You know what the worst thing in that one is is that Toyo makes a toilet, that instead of the water coming up and filling into the water cabinet in the back.12400:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.040Geoffrey Garth: It comes up a spigot, and it.12500:17:50.680 --> 00:18:02.370Geoffrey Garth: if you can wash your hands because it's flowing onto a small basin that feeds into the water cabinet. So rather than it being invisible. And you know, being of no use12600:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.740Geoffrey Garth: after you've gone to the bathroom, you can wash your hands right there.12700:18:06.910 --> 00:18:17.929Geoffrey Garth: and I was like that. That's been there for 20 years. I saw that when I was in a toy company in Japan, and I asked the people here at a trade show, and they're like, Yeah, no, there's no market for it in the Us. I was like fuck.12800:18:18.060 --> 00:18:25.960Geoffrey Garth: But so, yeah, and and and what I thought about with this was like, well, I don't have the wherewithal to12900:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.380Geoffrey Garth: to.13000:18:27.950 --> 00:18:42.970Geoffrey Garth: Well, I could build a prototype, but you don't need a prototype. I mean, it's so understandable that it's like Look so my thought was, boy, it would be nice to go license that to somebody, you know I did what I'm good at, and let them13100:18:43.130 --> 00:18:51.549Geoffrey Garth: who make faucets, you know, aunts growing, or, you know, goal, or whoever you know. So so that.13200:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.969The Alliance: Can I ask a weird question, Jeff, in listening to you.13300:18:55.575 --> 00:18:56.180Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.13400:18:56.924 --> 00:19:01.789The Alliance: I mean I I have 2 questions that are forming in my head. One is.13500:19:02.210 --> 00:19:24.800The Alliance: I mean, I've been around you for a while now, but and every time around you this is what you do. You like you you come in and you're like, I don't know what I do next, and by, like 10 min, you lay out like 3 or 4 things you're looking at that are all like viable. So my question is, and viable, and like, I'm not saying like, viable like these are good for the world. Kind of cool ideas.13600:19:24.800 --> 00:19:48.360The Alliance: why don't you? But you don't want to be you may want to be the guy who designs it 1st iteration, but you know not. Why don't you join somebody else's like innovation shop? Now, I'm not talking about like as a way to get to your high, hard purpose. But as a way to like, keep the ideas flowing because these are like you're, this doesn't stop with you13700:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.990The Alliance: in a great way.13800:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.669Geoffrey Garth: Well, you know, that's that's interesting. Because13900:19:54.010 --> 00:20:04.370Geoffrey Garth: I met a guy who runs an industrial design office in town here. When I was trying to do a couple of other things, and I was gonna hire him when I was still working.14000:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.040Geoffrey Garth: working, and14100:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.459Geoffrey Garth: the thought occurred to me, it's like God! It would be fun to be coming in here one or 2 days a week.14200:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.490Geoffrey Garth: You know, and to have some involvement.14300:20:16.280 --> 00:20:16.790Geoffrey Garth: It's.14400:20:16.790 --> 00:20:30.649The Alliance: I mean, it sounds like a like I mean it anywhere from there to like a Disney imagineer, I'm thinking. So. I got a friendar. He was the head engineer on Craig breed. Love's Spirit of America right then.14500:20:31.386 --> 00:20:32.730The Alliance: Right, remember that. And.14600:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.060Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.14700:20:33.060 --> 00:21:02.600The Alliance: On Peter's. He was part of Peter's xprize. So anyways, he's like, and he's an inventor of a flying motorcycle like he's a wild ass inventor, and he now has a job in Burbank for a company that basically does water features all over the world for Vegas and whatever. And he works on his stuff all the time. But he's just he's like, it's really fun, because their projects are so like absurdly diverse. And they're just like these weird engineering puzzles like.14800:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.210The Alliance: How do you get water to write the word fuck in the sky?14900:21:06.290 --> 00:21:32.580The Alliance: You know what I mean, like crazy stuff that people come to them with, and he's like it's it's enough to keep my engines going, and I do my stuff sort of on this, and he's full time there. You wouldn't have to be full time in a spot like that, but it would just. It seems like it might feed you in a way that that you're hungry for, and I like, and you and it seems like Jesus, man, your brain is a they could be a shame not to plug you into something with that brain of yours.15000:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.609Geoffrey Garth: Oh, yeah, that's a that's really interesting observation.15100:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.520Geoffrey Garth: I'm doing right.15200:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.900The Alliance: A connection seems like.15300:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.409Geoffrey Garth: Lunch with this guy runs this, I.15400:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.789The Alliance: You totally should. It seems like you have twin problems. Jeff. One is this like15500:21:54.050 --> 00:22:21.280The Alliance: bigger problem. I want something to really sick my teeth into. I got. Maybe I got one big project left in me, and I want it to fucking matter. Cool. The passion recipe will get you that answer. It's just not an immediate process on the more immediate front, especially if you're not being able to perform as an athlete at the level you want. You want the flow of innovation and innovation. So you got to play, plug yourself into something that's doing that at speed, I think, just for like, just to keep the motor running.15600:22:21.990 --> 00:22:27.810The Alliance: or we gotta keep sending you into the basement every 2 weeks with a new assignment like it's 1 or the other man.15700:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.830Geoffrey Garth: Yeah. Yeah.15800:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.029Geoffrey Garth: That I think that's good. I'm a little distracted because I15900:22:38.612 --> 00:22:42.409Geoffrey Garth: I'm not quite sure where my doctor's office is. This is my last16000:22:44.540 --> 00:22:50.750Geoffrey Garth: my last appointment with this guy. He's retiring and but16100:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.070Geoffrey Garth: I've I've got plenty of time, so I'll find it.16200:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.689Geoffrey Garth: What I need to do.16300:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.080The Alliance: Okay.16400:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.159Geoffrey Garth: Even his.16500:22:58.690 --> 00:23:11.170Geoffrey Garth: Oh, over. Oh, I I think I'm finding it here. Let me just put in one thing. It's cause alright. It's on my phone. Let me put you there. Let's see.16600:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.310Geoffrey Garth: Oh, come on!16700:23:18.180 --> 00:23:24.350Geoffrey Garth: Oh, I didn't hit that. Oh, well, fuck16800:23:24.850 --> 00:23:30.810Geoffrey Garth: alright, I'm gonna have to pull over and figure out what the fuck I'm doing, so I don't drive into somebody.16900:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.057The Alliance: Do you? Do you?17000:23:33.290 --> 00:23:38.020The Alliance: Do you want to get off our call earlier, or you do you just want me to chill for a second, while you figure that17100:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.170The Alliance: either. I find I'm chilling.17200:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.573Geoffrey Garth: Good, good, good, all right. Let me17300:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.040The Alliance: You do what you need. I'm footnoting a book and go crazy.17400:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.110Geoffrey Garth: Good gonna pull over here.17500:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.050Geoffrey Garth: Alright. I think I'm back.17600:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.260The Alliance: Figure out where you're going.17700:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.360Geoffrey Garth: Okay, yeah.17800:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.430Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.17900:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.240Geoffrey Garth: Hmm.18000:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.779Geoffrey Garth: Well, yeah, that sounds sounds like a place. But18100:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.755Geoffrey Garth: you know, I had one project that I mentioned to Clint, and18200:25:21.170 --> 00:25:28.349Geoffrey Garth: he came over when we were at dinner at some point, and said, Hey, you know my daughter's doing this, and18300:25:28.550 --> 00:25:44.389Geoffrey Garth: she'd be really interested in that beach cleanup thing that you've been that you talked about. And you know I was like, Oh, cool. Okay. Unfortunately, when I came back I disciplined myself to say, Look, go! Spend 10 min on the next step.18400:25:44.905 --> 00:25:54.149Geoffrey Garth: Which is to go test the last, the most recent prototype, and unfortunately it was not a successful test, and I learned something that18500:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.822Geoffrey Garth: you know I hadn't really anticipated.18600:25:58.650 --> 00:26:06.140Geoffrey Garth: So I'm back to like thinking about it. And I realized that I had gone to see this industrial design guy, because I had 218700:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.679Geoffrey Garth: products that I was thinking about. And neither one of them18800:26:12.870 --> 00:26:18.150Geoffrey Garth: panned out. I I went ahead and built one myself, and18900:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.318Geoffrey Garth: it worked pretty well. But19000:26:21.350 --> 00:26:28.409Geoffrey Garth: You know it was a child carrier that didn't hurt your back. And you know I do this because what happens is19100:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.499Geoffrey Garth: the world catches up to me. I see some need, and I19200:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.350Geoffrey Garth: come up with a solution. But you know, by the time19300:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.570Geoffrey Garth: by the time I get it built and whatnot.19400:26:42.740 --> 00:26:50.709Geoffrey Garth: I can look around and see that other people maybe not as well as I had, but other people have figured it out too.19500:26:50.830 --> 00:26:59.430Geoffrey Garth: and so there's no opportunity from a business standpoint for it to go further. So I have a number of, you know.19600:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.389Geoffrey Garth: failed if you will19700:27:01.840 --> 00:27:16.209Geoffrey Garth: prototypes down in my shop that worked fine. It's just that there wasn't any interest in it. I don't know if you happen to look at the this little slide show I threw together at the last minute because I needed to have something.19800:27:16.760 --> 00:27:30.050The Alliance: No, it's it's I. Because I'm finishing this book. It's what I get to do at the end of the day. Today it's my like reward for or tomorrow. When I turn in my new book, I get to go through everybody's stuff. I haven't. I haven't let myself go there yet.19900:27:30.310 --> 00:27:35.280Geoffrey Garth: Well, I this is a fun story. I'm watching my wife20000:27:35.410 --> 00:27:42.100Geoffrey Garth: with our new baby in this rocking chair, and she's please.20100:27:43.580 --> 00:27:54.329Geoffrey Garth: He's expressing milk for a with some machine while he's holding the baby and rocking the baby. And I'm like looking at this, and it's going, and I'm like20200:27:54.670 --> 00:28:01.740Geoffrey Garth: fuck. There ought to be a way that I can combine the motion of the rocking chair.20300:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.549The Alliance: Yeah, that's exactly what I was. Gonna say, is, you totally can use the rocking chair. That's funny. Okay, keep.20400:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.302Geoffrey Garth: Right. And and so20500:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.830Geoffrey Garth: so I I thought about it, and I, you know, kind of figured it out. But it20600:28:15.730 --> 00:28:23.990Geoffrey Garth: what I ultimately in thinking about it. Further, I realized what you're talking about is the power takeoff unit for a rocking chair.20700:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.390Geoffrey Garth: and you, familiar with the power takeoff.20800:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.390The Alliance: No.20900:28:29.250 --> 00:28:37.939Geoffrey Garth: In farm equipment. You got this tractor that you spend all this money on, and there are times when you need to run some big pump or something. So you just21000:28:38.050 --> 00:28:44.729Geoffrey Garth: disassemble the drive shaft assemble that you know it's very easily done because it's designed for this. You assemble21100:28:44.860 --> 00:28:50.040Geoffrey Garth: the pump on the the and you power it with the motor from the21200:28:51.640 --> 00:29:07.700Geoffrey Garth: from the tractor, and so that's called a power takeoff and you can use it, for you know, whatever it is that the Tractor Company has built units to to go. So what I said was, Look if the market for21300:29:09.140 --> 00:29:14.943Geoffrey Garth: for kid products, because I'd already tried a kid product that hadn't worked out well.21400:29:15.450 --> 00:29:22.730Geoffrey Garth: what would you really like to do if you could do a power takeoff, and I was like, Well, I'd like to get a back massage.21500:29:23.340 --> 00:29:32.000Geoffrey Garth: And so that became the the what I did was I? I developed this thing and built the back masseuse21600:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.952Geoffrey Garth: program into it.21700:29:34.590 --> 00:29:41.529Geoffrey Garth: And I built it. I started with a rocking chair, but ultimately I went to an air on chair. You know the air on chair.21800:29:43.910 --> 00:29:49.419Geoffrey Garth: And so I think there's a picture in there of the Aron chair that I.21900:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.770The Alliance: Oh, cool! Oh, cool!22000:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.120Geoffrey Garth: And and I got it. It works. It's in my, it's in my shop. But22100:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.830Geoffrey Garth: it was one of the last things that I tried to license to somebody, and22200:30:02.190 --> 00:30:13.651Geoffrey Garth: you know it. It didn't go. Well, everybody was real excited about it. But you know I it's a bad story. I won't even bother to go into it anymore. So22300:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.390Geoffrey Garth: But the idea of recognizing that22400:30:19.780 --> 00:30:28.500Geoffrey Garth: most ideas don't make it. Most toys don't make people thought it was great fun to be a toy designer. It's like, Yeah, you don't understand how often22500:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.429Geoffrey Garth: you develop a toy and take it all the way22600:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.209Geoffrey Garth: to ready, you know, to film a TV commercial. And and then then the marketing guys drop it.22700:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.360Geoffrey Garth: So you know the fact that this this22800:30:43.670 --> 00:30:49.969Geoffrey Garth: shop back to clean the beach. May not work, you know well, well, may not work.22900:30:51.460 --> 00:30:58.050The Alliance: Well that I mean, you know to me it's only it's only failure if you don't learn from it, and it doesn't lead any place.23000:30:58.614 --> 00:31:18.130The Alliance: Yeah, I also I there. And there's a caveat to that, Jeff I like sometimes that doesn't mean like, Oh, I gotta rebuild my beach vacuum cleaner today. So that means like, I'm gonna park that failure information in my brain. And I know that sometime in the next 10 years it's going to become useful because it always does. That's been my experience.23100:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.860Geoffrey Garth: I completely agree with that. And you know that's23200:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.729Geoffrey Garth: it. That idea has been parked, and it made a little23300:31:26.970 --> 00:31:33.312Geoffrey Garth: progress where I was able to buy the tool that I needed to build the next prototype. And so yes,23400:31:33.770 --> 00:31:41.619Geoffrey Garth: That's why I keep these things around, because it's like I'm not willing to completely abandon it, you know, but I used to.23500:31:42.100 --> 00:31:56.400Geoffrey Garth: I would tell the guys that work for me. Look, when you're buying pieces of supplies buy extra because that stuff is going to be laying around. And then, you know, it's gonna inform you on the next product. How many times23600:31:56.820 --> 00:32:05.789Geoffrey Garth: is something that I bought for one purpose being used in a subsequent development project. It happens all the time. So yeah.23700:32:11.900 --> 00:32:21.160The Alliance: What, by the way, just a a curiosity on on the back end of this we talked about this a little bit when we started. What's a win for you? What? What is a win for you? Is it23800:32:21.280 --> 00:32:28.310The Alliance: fulfillment? Is it a massively transformative purpose? Is it collaborative fun?23900:32:33.890 --> 00:32:34.620Geoffrey Garth: Well,24000:32:36.590 --> 00:32:41.860Geoffrey Garth: A win for me is making something that other people are impressed by.24100:32:42.580 --> 00:32:49.189Geoffrey Garth: You know it's that you know. Appreciation. For my creativity.24200:32:49.710 --> 00:32:55.339Geoffrey Garth: I got it from my mom. I remember I came home with some piece, and I was built, turned it in24300:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.779Geoffrey Garth: to a whole airplane. It was one. And she's like, Wow, so24400:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.980Geoffrey Garth: when your gets home, you know, you gotta show that to him, you know. And that was just like24500:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.696Geoffrey Garth: that was as good as it gets and24600:33:10.430 --> 00:33:29.329Geoffrey Garth: you know. That's why I would enjoy as you'll see the Halloween costumes, because, you know, I get to knock these things out in a couple of days and go out on Halloween night and have everybody be just like blown away. You know I want $10,000 with my Halloween costumes over time.24700:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.239The Alliance: That's cool. That's cool.24800:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.889Geoffrey Garth: And24900:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.940Geoffrey Garth: So25000:33:35.270 --> 00:33:50.820Geoffrey Garth: you know, it's it's it's having my creativity appreciated. I finally finished the video of a safari that I took with my girlfriend last year, and you know I was just like really happy to one have it completed.25100:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.919Geoffrey Garth: you know. Pretty much to my satisfaction, and25200:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.125Geoffrey Garth: and then, to, you know, share it with some people. I'm still waiting to get some feedback25300:34:01.550 --> 00:34:09.690Geoffrey Garth: because the you know, I didn't have a dropbox account for it to go to blah blah. So that's you know, that's and then and then.25400:34:10.340 --> 00:34:17.292Geoffrey Garth: you know, if it's something that makes a difference in the world. Now, now I'm really getting somewhere, you know.25500:34:17.810 --> 00:34:24.839Geoffrey Garth: the but people would talk to me about the neck brace and say, Well, you know, that must be25600:34:25.090 --> 00:34:29.822Geoffrey Garth: terribly satisfying. I was like, well, yeah, it is. But at the same time25700:34:30.420 --> 00:34:38.040Geoffrey Garth: you know, if it if I'd started in on a sporting piece of sporting goods or something. I just want to be an inventor.25800:34:38.190 --> 00:34:44.536Geoffrey Garth: And the fact that you know the need that was identified for me was25900:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.840Geoffrey Garth: was a medical product that was gonna save people's lives and make me a lot of money.26000:34:50.820 --> 00:34:58.410Geoffrey Garth: Well, how great is that?
