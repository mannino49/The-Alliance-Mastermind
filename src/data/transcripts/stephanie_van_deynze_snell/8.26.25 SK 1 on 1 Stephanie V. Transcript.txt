WEBVTT100:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.590Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hello!200:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.750The Alliance: How are you?300:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.130Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh my goodness.400:00:23.360 --> 00:00:32.620Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: just been summering hard. I'm good. I feel really good, but I also feel like I need school to start in 2 weeks, because it's just been, likeÉ500:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.099Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: all over the place.600:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.639Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: My life feels completely chaotic right now.700:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.290Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But I also feel really good, soÉ I don't know, that was one of my things I was gonna ask you. It's like thisÉ800:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.330Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, like, I feel if I could summarize the last900:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.839Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: even, like, 2 months, it's definitely been, like.1000:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Primary flow, and lots of active recovery.1100:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.350The Alliance: What's wrong with that?1200:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.439Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: nothing's wrong with it, but then at the same time, I'm like.1300:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.820Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Well, what I find really interesting is that normally.1400:01:09.850 --> 00:01:18.209Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: when I would go through time periods where it's like, you know, the kids are home, and it's, like, lots of just, like, being with the kids or doing stuff, you know, that's not, like, work.1500:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.049Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I would have a lot ofÉ like, a lot of guilt and shame.1600:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.729Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right, so that I'm not really enjoying anything.1700:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.989Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But this time.1800:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.840Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I actually don't really feel any guilt and shame. I'm like, no, September will come, and I know once I really get, you know, kind ofÉ1900:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.500Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: really going with, like, all the stuff I have planned that's waiting for me, once I can get home and get some free time.2000:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.419Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: that it'll move really fast, you know? So, I don't know, I've never felt like this in my life.2100:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.329The Alliance: So, É Let me just ask a couple of questions.2200:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.150The Alliance: So, if I was to give you a quick and fast and dirty diagnosis, I would say.2300:02:03.370 --> 00:02:17.670The Alliance: This is somebody who has managed to internalize enough of the compound interest to flow that you understand that in September, you'll get back into the workflow and you'll kick ass.2400:02:17.950 --> 00:02:29.519The Alliance: That usually allows people to start recovering without guilt or shame, because they have theÉ this guilt or shame is usually a cover-up for2500:02:29.520 --> 00:02:40.570The Alliance: I'm scared of the future, it's uncertain, and I want to micromanage my state through micromanaging the future. Usually it's some version of that one, right?2600:02:40.600 --> 00:02:52.629The Alliance: Or I want to get ahead of the overload that's coming. Now you're like, oh no, I got the overload, I don't have to, right, so I can prioritize what is actually going to allow me to, you knowÉ2700:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.290The Alliance: hit the ground running in September. It's sort of like when people look at me, they're like, well, do you have any ideas for your next book? And I'm like.2800:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.100The Alliance: Well, no, but I got a bookshelf filled with 10 books I haven't read, and I've got 2 months coming.2900:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.159The Alliance: Ask me in 2 months, and I will absolutelyÉ I'll have 4 books, right? I'm gonna fill up my brain.3000:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.210The Alliance: let it percolate into the unconscious, and then when I roar back, I'm gonna roar back, and I've done it for decades, so I know3100:03:24.210 --> 00:03:38.930The Alliance: Completely, this is the process, so it doesn't change the fact that sometimes the anxiety still pokes itself into my consciousness, or something like, why am I not feeling guilt? Or why am I not feeling shame? Or should I be more concerned? Like, all that stuff.3200:03:38.930 --> 00:03:56.960The Alliance: But I canÉ I have a negotiation tool. I'm likeÉ and I always, likeÉ I always sort of respect my fear. I'm always like, okay, thank you, I see that you're warning me about the future. Open question. It seems like I can move at speed, it seems like I've gotÉ done all the things. Is there anything you're seeing that I'm not seeing that is an open loop?3300:03:57.240 --> 00:04:08.510The Alliance: And, like, if there's no answer, then I justÉ I'm sort of done with it, you know what I mean? And I think you're at the front end of that process, is the first thing I would say. The second thing is.3400:04:08.860 --> 00:04:18.789The Alliance: it strikes me, and this is after, sort of reviewing the notes from prior calls with you and Ryan and other things, right? And it seems like3500:04:19.490 --> 00:04:26.540The Alliance: And this is alwaysÉ this is a big saver for people during summer times, is as long as you maintain your flow rituals.3600:04:26.730 --> 00:04:37.420The Alliance: You're sort of maintaining a thread to the version of you that can jump back in to superpower you. Where it gets weird is if you take a vacation and you stay out of flow.3700:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.549The Alliance: And then you're trying to remember, oh, I'm gonna get this state in the future that's gonna amp me up. But if you're getting into flow along the way, you're like, oh.3800:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.859The Alliance: this is what's coming, I got this. Does that make sense? Is that helpful? Is that what you're experiencing?3900:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.440Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.4000:04:52.680 --> 00:05:11.009Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, it does, and my computer's doing this thing. If I look like I'm funny with just my black screen, but I can still hear you, but I can't see you. Oh, now it's a white screen. Oh my goodness. I'm having the worst time with tech here, too. I smashed my phone, and I'm at the lake, again, with all the kids, and I, like, ran home from the beach.4100:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.829The Alliance: I can tell you that I see you perfectly, your camera's.4200:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.590Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Good.4300:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.010The Alliance: There's no glitch, there's no delay, there's nothing, I can't tell. So it's on your end.4400:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.839Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, so I just can't see you, or myself, soÉ.4500:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.270The Alliance: Do youÉ I mean, do you wannaÉ should we hang up and try to dial back in? Would that be better?4600:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.830Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It'sÉ I, like, I can't even do anything. My screen is just black, and IÉ I can'tÉ so I don't even know if that will help.4700:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.040Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Unless I, like, yeah, like, force close my computer, but I know we only have a few minutes, so IÉ well, I couldÉ yeah.4800:05:43.210 --> 00:05:52.980Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And if I could call from my phone, I'd be like, well, that's a good backup, but I smashed it the other day, and that's also not working, and I'm at the lake, so I can't even get it fixed until later this week.4900:05:53.370 --> 00:06:02.269The Alliance: Okay, we could just, it's fine, like, yeah, I could turn off my camera on the phone, andÉ5000:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.810The Alliance: Will that work for you?5100:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.970Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, orÉ.5200:06:05.970 --> 00:06:16.519The Alliance: Whatever's easy. If you want to hang up and try to dial back in, see if it comes back, force quit, totally fine. I've got theÉ I will give youÉ I've got an extra 5 minutes, it'llÉ you know, we can goÉ.5300:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, let's do that quick. Okay, I'll do the forest closed, and we'll see.5400:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.300The Alliance: Alright.5500:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.839The Alliance: The item via text.5600:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.940The Alliance: Find a moment where you guys canÉ Commune.5700:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.209The Alliance: And I think Evan's had someÉ5800:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.869The Alliance: somewhat intense interactions with Peter, where he had to kind of wake Peter up out of a slumber.5900:07:22.480 --> 00:07:31.869The Alliance: I think some moment where Peter was likeÉ Kind of stood up andÉ held a boundary thatÉ6000:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.990The Alliance: Of their light to be heard.6100:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.699The Alliance: So, it might require a new level of6200:07:40.090 --> 00:07:50.619The Alliance: intentionality and skill on your part to hold a boundary, so new mental scaffolding, but that scaffolding is going to serve you everywhere, and in some way, Peter is a gymnasium.6300:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.269The Alliance: A dojo set by the universe, custom-crafted to build Your emotional musculature.6400:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.240The Alliance: So, see him as curriculum.6500:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.720The Alliance: Whatever you're struggling with Peter.6600:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.370The Alliance: you're gonna struggle with everywhere in your life, so if you learn this.6700:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.760The Alliance: Now, your whole life upgrades in every dimension.6800:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.720The Alliance: So let'sÉ let's really look at this as a workout.6900:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.710The Alliance: Go ahead.7000:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.899The Alliance: Anyway, let's go. Let's go.7100:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.010The Alliance: Harvey.7200:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.300Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hello.7300:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.150The Alliance: Aye.7400:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.640Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, I'm hopeful.7500:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.289Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: It's like, when it rains, it pours. It's okay.7600:10:21.740 --> 00:10:39.669Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, exactly like what you were saying. I think it'sÉ it's, like, understanding as well that, how my biology works. Like, I'm not gonna be as productive as I want to be anyway if I'm always, like, living in, like, shame and guilt like I used to be, because I used to let myselfÉ7700:10:40.000 --> 00:10:59.160Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like, I was very motivated by fear, you know, feeling like, oh, I'm horrible, I have to, like, do all these things so that I, you know, I'mÉ that I matter, or I'm worth something, or whatever, and then that's, like, where, obviously, I got so burnt out and kind of depressed, right? And, like, the anxiety and everything, soÉ7800:10:59.870 --> 00:11:09.039Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, IÉ was it last night or the nightÉ yeah, the night before last night, whatever it was, I was laying down to go to sleep, and I was like, whoa, I'm so happy.7900:11:09.650 --> 00:11:18.799Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And that wasÉ is something that has not been, like, a normal for me, like, and not just happy, but I felt really, like, also satisfied.8000:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.169Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Which, for me, is, like, very, very rare.8100:11:22.660 --> 00:11:29.489Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because I'm always kind of like, what else? What else can I do? And I really enjoy, like, the game of things, so, I mean, in general, right?8200:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.609The Alliance: Are youÉ how old are you? 40É what?8300:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.680Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: 41.8400:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.330The Alliance: Sorry to cut you off.8500:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.340Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No, it's okay.8600:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.790The Alliance: There's, soÉ8700:11:39.240 --> 00:11:56.100The Alliance: the 40sÉ it's really theÉ the 40s can be difficult, but by the closer and into your 50s you get, that stuffÉ some of that stuff fades through natural adult development, so one, it gets less of a stranglehold on you. Two, I think that's allÉ8800:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.750The Alliance: like, awesome. I mean, just really exciting. I will, É8900:12:02.120 --> 00:12:09.120The Alliance: Warning is the wrong word, because this is awesome, if you understand what's happening, because it's a chance9000:12:09.120 --> 00:12:24.479The Alliance: Because if you fix this, it doesn't come back, right? Like, and that's a huge upgrade. So, like, you'reÉ life is gonnaÉ life, usually at this point, with satisfaction or whatever, is gonna give you the standard curriculum, which is the fear's gonna come back.9100:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.640The Alliance: Right? OrÉ9200:12:26.910 --> 00:12:34.990The Alliance: Things will start to overload you, like the phone, like the video, you know, that life will happen, the fear will find a way to come back, andÉ9300:12:34.990 --> 00:12:57.419The Alliance: And it's the same protocol. You're just like, no, you know what I mean? You just sort of have those conversations, and know that with those long cycles, because those are cycles that are deep and built on meaning and the need for safety and security, so they're deep cycles, right? They're really deep, they're almost reptilian, and they're probably even, like.9400:12:57.800 --> 00:13:09.900The Alliance: not proof on what I'm about to say, but I will tell you that I think they're actuallyÉ that the patterns associated with them get, like, hardwired into the cerebellum, too, so, like, the brain keeps backup copies of them, as far as I can tell.9500:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.370Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's awful.9600:13:11.370 --> 00:13:34.420The Alliance: Yeah, so my point is, like, this is why I thinkÉ so one of the questions I've asked a long time is, why do patterns repeat over and over and over again until you learn the lesson? Like, what is that? If it's not mystical, if it's self-generated based on perspective and bias, and how things get shaped, and, you know, the filters, basically, and what would technically be9700:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.200The Alliance: gateÉ gating, right? The gating function of the thalamus more than anything else.9800:13:41.860 --> 00:13:52.689The Alliance: is a question I've asked a lot, and I don't have a good answer other than, I think when you set up, like, primal fears or primal needs, the brainÉ9900:13:52.990 --> 00:14:00.399The Alliance: willÉ constantly keep checking in to make sure, because now you're like, am I safe?10000:14:00.610 --> 00:14:11.119The Alliance: And, do I have meaning? Like, am I safe, and do I have a place to go to forward that, like, is pulling, right? Those are theÉ you're basically checking for safety and motivation. That's what that is. It's, right?10100:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.159The Alliance: Safety and motivation.10200:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.480The Alliance: And, É10300:14:14.990 --> 00:14:28.389The Alliance: what you've learned is you're safe, and you're motivated. And motivation, if you recover, is this deep well that you can really tap into infinitely, but the feelings, the old habit, is gonna keep coming. It's whyÉ.10400:14:28.390 --> 00:14:28.880Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right?10500:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.840The Alliance: when people start makingÉ you had this experience, I'm sure. When you started making a lot of money, there was a period where, like.10600:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.899The Alliance: it went up, and then it went away, and then it came back, then it went away, and then it stabilized, right?10700:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.970Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: True, yeah.10800:14:43.150 --> 00:15:01.589The Alliance: That's usually a fear-based response, so, like, fear starts limiting, you start making different choices, leaning on your staff in slightly different, like, things, you do subtle things to signal boss is afraid, and they have unconscious reactions to bosses afraid, and it chokes profit.10900:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.229The Alliance: Right? Yeah.11000:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.780Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: bet.11100:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.570The Alliance: Yeah.11200:15:05.920 --> 00:15:22.360Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, and I mean, like, my money mindset has always been really strange from what I compare to other people. Like, I've never really thought about money, and I've always just been, like, I know how to work hard, and I've never even wanted to think about money. I'm like, I just know if I work hard, I'll be fine.11300:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.540Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And that's kind of how I was raised, and how I neverÉ11400:15:27.190 --> 00:15:45.680Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: really worried about it, and then all of a sudden we were making a lot. Like, I remember the first time we had, like, aÉ I don't know, like, a $500,000 month with the vet clinic, and I was like, holy shit, like, that was just, you know, and it was kind ofÉ É but then I started, yeah, having a little bit of panic around, like, God, now we have to maintain this.11500:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.150Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: So it was almost, yeah, like, once I had it, yeah, exactly, it was kind of like this.11600:15:50.150 --> 00:16:01.329The Alliance: Yeah, and it'sÉ I mean, it's also function creep, right? Because the more money you have, the more money you'll spend, the more it costs to make money, like, everyÉ here's what I've noticed about my life in a weird way.11700:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.940Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: role, also.11800:16:01.940 --> 00:16:20.240The Alliance: I've always sort of, like, I've sort of always hovered near, the edge of breaking even, punctuated by periods of, oh, it's raining cash. With the occasional ocean, I've lost all my cash, right? I don't have the ocean, I've lost all my cash is.11900:16:20.560 --> 00:16:27.450The Alliance: very much anymore. But, like, even shutting down FRC, it was a million and a half dollars to shut that company down.12000:16:27.450 --> 00:16:49.369The Alliance: Like, that's what it costs to put to bed. Not a smallÉ you know what I mean? So, like, even that, like, I'mÉ I was semi-prepared, so it didn't sink me, but, like, wow, that's a big hole to climb out of at 57, or 58, or however the fuck old I am, you know what I mean? So, my point is not on the money, my point is literally on the, É.12100:16:49.370 --> 00:16:57.080Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: the fears are gonna come back, the shame, guilt, whatever is the old pattern, right? Even if you negotiate with the shame and the guilt.12200:16:57.080 --> 00:17:10.390The Alliance: all you're gonna do is unearth the actual anxieties underneath. Like, there's a bunch of layers of behavior, so just expect them to pop back in, run the same belt, have the same negotiation, and12300:17:10.390 --> 00:17:20.389The Alliance: Cleave to your daily flow rituals, because that's really what's unlocking a lot of stuff for you. You're more patient with everything because of the creativity microdosing. I can see it.12400:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.910Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.12500:17:20.910 --> 00:17:26.930The Alliance: And, you know, and also, This is the differentÉ this is, likeÉ12600:17:27.180 --> 00:17:38.830The Alliance: There is something to be said for livingÉ living a flow path with, like, a group and some guidance along the way, punk for periods, because it really allows you to fine-tune, and it also12700:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.320The Alliance: This is the last thing I'll say,12800:17:42.060 --> 00:17:49.090The Alliance: We have questions when we read and we learn and we train ourselves, and even if we hear from friends, like.12900:17:49.610 --> 00:17:55.929The Alliance: is this real? Is it really gonna work? Is it a placebo? Is it gonna work for a long period? Like, all that stuff.13000:17:56.340 --> 00:18:03.169The Alliance: And, and am I doing it right? And when you get to co-train, and when you get to etc.13100:18:04.270 --> 00:18:10.019The Alliance: A lot of those questions get answered, so you feel moreÉ that's the confidence you feel in your bounce back.13200:18:10.020 --> 00:18:33.809The Alliance: you probably had a bunch of unconscious questions that were weighing on cognitive load that weren't real things yet, but they were there, and so now a bunch of them have been answered. You know how this goes, though. You're gonna get to the next level of intelligence and discover how stupid you are all over again, and repeat, right? Like, that's theÉ that'sÉ like, that doesn't change. I could just tell you that I'm dumber now than I ever was before, and I just published a paper with Friston.13300:18:34.460 --> 00:18:40.749Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, I know. So, yeah, I know that's so true, because now, as I'm starting to look at, like, even how to write13400:18:40.920 --> 00:18:54.059Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like, white papers, and, like, with, like, references and everything again, like, I had to submit something for, for a talk I'm doing thisÉ this fall, andÉ and it, like, it was the notes for the conference. I needed all my references, so I'mÉ13500:18:54.230 --> 00:19:09.300Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I was, like, taken back to university, and I was like, oh, I forgot how much I hate doing this, but I'm like, if I want to do my PhD, like, I need to get better at this again, and writing like that. So that's my one thing right now. I'm like, oh man, I'm really gonna have to dig in and, like, learn how toÉ to do this better, and with moreÉ13600:19:09.310 --> 00:19:27.889Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: ease, you know, and, like, not let theÉ that struggle, like, pull meÉ me down and get me frustrated, because it's just, like, a skill I need to develop that's, like, not the easiest for me to want to reference things, because I'm just like, oh, this is what feels right, let's just go with it, and then having to actually, É13700:19:27.910 --> 00:19:38.900Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: like, not necessarily, like, the whole point of referencing and, like, wanting to know that it's actually real, like, it came from somewhere, like, that does matter to me, but, just theÉ13800:19:39.100 --> 00:19:53.839Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Just, like, the clicking the boxes, right, of, like, having the reference list at the bottom, that's the stuff where I wish I, like, I had someone to work with, and then I could get them to format. It's evenÉ even just formatting, to me, like, almost kills me.13900:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.610The Alliance: ChatGPT can form it.14000:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.070Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: É Yeah.14100:19:57.510 --> 00:20:03.840Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, it can. Oh god, my screen went black again. Something's wrong with my computer, but it's fine. I can hear you. Oh, it's back.14200:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.229Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, I'm good.14300:20:05.650 --> 00:20:18.879Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, okay, because that was one of my big questions for you, because, like, along with everything I've learned with this, like, the other thing I've been really, strengthening as well, and this is my question for you, because I also started reading West of Jesus.14400:20:19.100 --> 00:20:29.659Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And I was reading the intuition and Flow paper and everything, too, so I have this big question mark around where science and spirituality meet, and then also, because I feel likeÉ14500:20:30.330 --> 00:20:44.020Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: yeah, like, since I've felt more of a connection, like, with myself, or something bigger than me, like, whatever, call it, God, or like, like, I kind of think we're all one, like, I'm very muchÉ like, I'm rooted in that quite a bit. É14600:20:44.350 --> 00:20:53.799Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And I don't know why, it just kind of feels right, but then that's where I get excited about the science, because I'm like, where does scienceÉ and not end, but, like, then it's like.14700:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.009Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: What can we not explain yet?14800:20:57.310 --> 00:21:11.279Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: And I'm loving reading West of Jesus, and I'm only about a quarter of the way through. I wish I was done at all before this talk, but I didn't have time. But yeah, so, how do you, like, navigate that, like, that, you know, kind ofÉ14900:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.320Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I don't know. I don't even know if that'sÉ not really a question thatÉ.15000:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.020The Alliance: Let meÉ let meÉ15100:21:18.280 --> 00:21:25.419The Alliance: Before I give you a long-winded answer, let meÉ a couple things. Have you read Bill Bryson's A Short History of Everything?15200:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.000Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: No.15300:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.790The Alliance: You have to.15400:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay.15500:21:30.010 --> 00:21:36.559The Alliance: It's the greatest science pop-sci book of all time. Literally the most fun you'll ever have15600:21:36.640 --> 00:21:53.670The Alliance: Reading a side book. You will literally learn everything you wanted to know about the universe, physiÉ I mean, like, it isÉ it's amazing, it's so fun, and it's so fun. He's so fun and funny. That's the science book everybody wishes they wrote, including me. Anyways, É15700:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.660The Alliance: It is a great look at15800:21:58.250 --> 00:22:07.190The Alliance: amongÉ there's a lot of good looks at this, but the question of, are we all one? Like, it's a really good science answer to that, in terms of, like.15900:22:07.350 --> 00:22:15.560The Alliance: just, like, of course we are, but, like, he really breaks down the oneÉ like, the science of the oneness, so that's first thing. The second thing isÉ16000:22:16.580 --> 00:22:24.139The Alliance: I am certainly not going to make up your mind for you about the bigger questions around flow and spirituality. What I can tell you is16100:22:24.170 --> 00:22:40.619The Alliance: Very briefly, my experience. I didn't come to science first. I went to spirituality first. I spent time in ashrams and monasteries. I could sit for the full lotus in a very long period of time. I lived in that world. I was very interested in that world, and I found nothing16200:22:40.760 --> 00:22:59.630The Alliance: satisfying at all. Zero. Until I started regularly getting into flow. And then the next question I asked, which is really the question that's the core of West to Jesus, even though I never formally say it, is, is there any difference between a flow state and a spiritual experience? I don't think there is. As far as I can tell, they're the exact same experience, and16300:22:59.820 --> 00:23:07.019The Alliance: as far as I can tell, the feeling of oneness with everything, the openness to nature that comes with it, the, like.16400:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.110The Alliance: It produces a very specific16500:23:10.110 --> 00:23:29.090The Alliance: set of feelings. It's not just that it's a spiritual experience, it's a very specific kind of spiritual experience. So why is it thatÉ is that good for the survival of the species? Is that to connect us to something good? I don't have answers to that. The best I can come up with is what I have said over and over again.16600:23:29.090 --> 00:23:34.700The Alliance: And this isÉ what Dr. Newberg and I are creating. Our job is how?16700:23:35.580 --> 00:23:47.519The Alliance: Our interest is in phenomenon that are global, especially before the age of mass communication, that show up in many of the wisdom traditions, and when that happens, we say, oh, there's smoke.16800:23:47.580 --> 00:24:05.440The Alliance: Is there fire? Who knows? Let's go look, and let's use the tools of neurobiology, because that's what we're comfortable with. I want to know how the experience happens, why the experience happens above our pay grade. Personally, I am agnostic, and I think anybody who's not agnostic16900:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.110The Alliance: Is arrogant beyond belief.17000:24:08.490 --> 00:24:32.580The Alliance: you actually think you have an answer to, there's a God, there's not a God, you know what I mean? Like, that's amazing. I'm amazed. I'm just like, wow, that's so cool that you could feel that way, I can't do it, and it strikes me as the most arrogant thing I could possibly do with my incredibly limited brain, knowing what I know about gating and perception to say, oh, I can, you know, I can deduce17100:24:32.590 --> 00:24:48.819The Alliance: from the very limited data that I have, that there is or isn't, but I think I leave it open for interpretation, and personally, I believe in Occam's Razor. It is easier for me to live my life as a believer than as a non-believer, and I find that the right17200:24:49.320 --> 00:25:13.019The Alliance: frequency for me is, like, 75 believe or 25 not, and it goes up and down depending on the data, but those are my other probabilities, and that's how I think about it. And I think the actual probabilities of God versus know God, if you're actually weighing the data, is probably 65 in favor and 45 opposed. But that's just me, and I think these are the great questions that flow and a flow path enables, because17300:25:13.220 --> 00:25:21.779The Alliance: Honest to God, I tried it, and if you're sitting around trying to figure out these questions using the path of spiritual experiences, and the monasteries, and the psychedelics, and all that stuff.17400:25:21.780 --> 00:25:41.080The Alliance: I found them lame. I found they don't lead me to actual answers. They make me feel good. Sometimes they show me things that I can be creative with. They often get me laid, but, you know, they, like, for the stuff I really want, the flow states are what really work, you know what I mean? LikeÉ17500:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.100The Alliance: that's sort of how I've always looked at it, and I'm like, I had questions.17600:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.279The Alliance: I'm on a path, it's leading me to answers.17700:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.719The Alliance: My original question was, where does the information come and flowÉ from and flow? Is itÉ17800:25:55.830 --> 00:26:08.380The Alliance: us self-generated, or is there something bigger? Is there levels of the embodied, embedded cognitive matrix we don't yet understand, or is there something even beyond that, that we could classify as the mystery? And ultimately, for me.17900:26:09.410 --> 00:26:16.439The Alliance: Every single day, all I try to do is surf the mystery and extend the conversation.18000:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.459Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, I love that. Yeah. That's how I feel I am, too. Like, I'm definitely, likeÉ18100:26:23.830 --> 00:26:29.730Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, like, yeah, it kind of feels like there's, you know, something, and I think right now that gives meÉ18200:26:30.180 --> 00:26:39.769Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because I feel, like, the weight of the world and, like, the pain of the world, so maybe it's just been, like, a coping mechanism for me to be like, well, you know, there must be something more.18300:26:40.010 --> 00:26:45.409Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Or, like, why? Is there so much pain in the world? You know, that kind of thing. And then it's this whole idea of, like.18400:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.249Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: We need to know what we are not.18500:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.420Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Before we can really understand and know what we.18600:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.560The Alliance: So I've got another reÉ I've got another book for you to read, and É18700:26:57.310 --> 00:27:08.019The Alliance: This is not an easyÉ it's a very short book, it's very fun. I recommend it over and over and over again, but it is not easy on the soul in the end.18800:27:08.440 --> 00:27:17.680The Alliance: which is Annie Dillard's for the Time Being. Because Annie DillardÉ this is what my new novel is sort of about, also. It's the question ofÉ18900:27:18.040 --> 00:27:30.119The Alliance: Why this design? It's a bad design. Everything eats everything to survive, everything gets erased in the end. It's a bad design. The Jews solve it with the shattering of the Sephirot, and say.19000:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.790Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: that, like.19100:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.629The Alliance: God, the creation blew up.19200:27:32.690 --> 00:27:49.259The Alliance: Right? There's lots of different solutions to this answer. The Iroquois believe that, like, the world's fucked up because medicine woman got curious and dug up the tree of life and fell through the hole, right? Like, lots of people got lots of theories about, you know, theÉ what isÉ theyÉ19300:27:49.280 --> 00:28:12.560The Alliance: People call it the problem of evil. I don't necessarily know if that's true. I think we're in the earth learning experience, and you can understand all these things from a certain perspective. I'm a Jew, and I can give you a very clear reason, metaphysically, why I think the Holocaust happened. That aligns with my worldview. Honest to God. Honest to God. And same thing with slavery, and all the stuff. I've gotÉ19400:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.499The Alliance: My answers, based on a particular thing, it doesn't change the fact that it's a shitty design.19500:28:18.500 --> 00:28:28.419The Alliance: It's fucking mean. It's fucking mean. There's no way around it. Like, okay, so you were trying to teach me something? You couldn't come up with a betterÉ like, fuck you. That's my feeling.19600:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.200The Alliance: Right?19700:28:29.750 --> 00:28:39.059Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That'sÉ yeah, I know, that's kind of sometimes how IÉ but then it's like theÉ yeah, like, to me, none of that would be considered, you know, God, so then it's likeÉ.19800:28:39.410 --> 00:28:45.940The Alliance: Yeah. Dude, I watch my dogs every day kill mice and lizards. Every day.19900:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.109The Alliance: Fucking love my dogs!20000:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.170Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I know!20100:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.770The Alliance: And I like mice!20200:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.850The Alliance: You know what I mean? Like, I'mÉ they're all my fucking Doolittle friends, okay?20300:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.530Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.20400:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.780The Alliance: I don't know if that's helpful. The other thing I will tell you is anyÉ.20500:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.419Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: What's the name of that book again? What was the name of the book again?20600:29:04.420 --> 00:29:15.809The Alliance: I'm gonna text you the books that you're gonnaÉ I'm gonna text you some books. Bryson, Dillard, yeah, I'll just doÉ Steph, what's your number? So I justÉ do I have it? I do have it. Boom.20700:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.689Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I don't know.20800:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.100The Alliance: No, I think I got it.20900:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Q048.21000:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.910The Alliance: You froze.21100:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.770Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: 880-9937.21200:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, yeah.21300:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.720The Alliance: 2-0-4.21400:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.450Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Did I?21500:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.090The Alliance: Beautiful.21600:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.420Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Thank you forÉ 9937.21700:29:31.830 --> 00:29:46.029The Alliance: Okay, I think I got it. The other thingsÉ so, Dr. Andy Newberg, who I worked with, has written, like, 10 very popular books, and he wrote the foundation and founding textbook on the field of neurotheology, which is what you're poking at.21800:29:46.120 --> 00:30:05.710The Alliance: And, so, like, you can, like, neurotheology, brain science, spirituality, religious experience, you can read. That's the founding textbook. And any of his books. I love how God changes your brain and why God won't go away. I think both.21900:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.550Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: All of those areÉ.22000:30:06.550 --> 00:30:13.250The Alliance: spectacular books, on this topic. Yeah, there's a lot of people, I mean.22100:30:13.300 --> 00:30:28.229The Alliance: This rabbit hole goes very, very deep, because as you start poking before Newberg, you have to also understand that Newberg is reacting to a rise ofÉ in the 90s, evangelists took over America because22200:30:28.560 --> 00:30:47.209The Alliance: of a thing that the government did, they courted the evangelist boat, and suddenly the evangelists were loud, and so guys like Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawson's and Steven Pinker, this was a huge fight. Creationists versus evolutionists, and nobody wanted to come down on the side of God, because nobody wanted to give the evolutionists an inch22300:30:47.210 --> 00:31:03.259The Alliance: Because they were banning stem cells and abortion, and it was crazy, you know what I mean, right? So, like, thisÉ it was this really gnarly fight, and a lot was at stake, and it's actually the reÉ this fight is the reason that AmericaÉ like, if you want to know what hapÉ what happened to America.22400:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.420The Alliance: This is what happened to America.22500:31:05.550 --> 00:31:24.579The Alliance: George W. Bush Sr. decided the best way to get elected was to court the vote from the Christian right, and nobody had ever done that before, because they knew it was a powder keg that was going to explode. And he did it, and that's what happened. This isÉ this isÉ TrumpÉ everything we're living in, this is the end result of a decision made in 1989.22600:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.690The Alliance: É22700:31:26.350 --> 00:31:41.639The Alliance: But, so there'sÉ when you read Nuber, when you read some of these early folks who are thinking about this, you have to remember it's also a reaction against behaviorism and evangelical Christianity, which are both still dominant in the 90s.22800:31:42.050 --> 00:31:47.890Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah. Yeah. No, I think, like, just in general, like, something that really drives me isÉ22900:31:48.090 --> 00:31:57.440Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: making, yeah, just, like, things really simple, because I think, yeah, stuff like that, like, you know, people tend to want to polarize.23000:31:57.480 --> 00:32:11.789Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I find. And that isÉ that seems to be something I'm very passionate about, is, like, how can we, you know, kind of, diffuse that a little bit, because, like, they make things, you know, it's like, it has to be this or this.23100:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.240Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But I like to play, like, in the nuances and, like, the gray zones.23200:32:15.420 --> 00:32:21.179Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Of maybe everyone's right, you know, kind of thing? And, like, how is everybody, you know, kind of saying the same thing?23300:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.169Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Because I feel like most of the time, people are saying the same thing, exceptÉ.23400:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.190The Alliance: Well, that's why I will tell you that my jobÉ23500:32:29.810 --> 00:32:45.179The Alliance: actually, when you get, like, when you stand right next to me and live my life, if I'm not actually working as a writer, I'm usually a translator. And even as a writer, I'm mostly a translator. What I do is translate between a lot of languages. I can go from23600:32:46.260 --> 00:32:55.789The Alliance: Computational neuroscience, to neurobiology, to embodied cognition, to philosophy of mind, to psychology, to pop culture, toÉ.23700:32:55.790 --> 00:32:56.430Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Hmm.23800:32:56.950 --> 00:33:16.099The Alliance: Deridian postmodern theory, blah blah. I don'tÉ I speak Spanish, right? But I speak, like, 37 technical languages to some level of fluency because of my journalism career and my reading habits over the years, and as a result, I'm a translator. And I'm also a translator intoÉ I mean, you don't understand23900:33:16.100 --> 00:33:28.559The Alliance: I was reading, Yenge Mingay Rimpache, who's my favorite Tibetan Buddhist, and the one who's done the most neuroscience, and the happiest man on Earth, or one of the happiest man on Earth for a while,24000:33:29.590 --> 00:33:49.330The Alliance: his work, and he, in one of his books, he actually gives me, for the first time ever, the Tibetan word for flow, because there's a TibetanÉ there's all word for it. Satori is the Japanese word. So if you're looking in the Zen tradition, it's Satori that they useÉ it's a brief, temporarily enlightenment. Satori is flow.24100:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.989The Alliance: Now, people will mistake it, including Shin Xen Yang, who I love.24200:33:53.990 --> 00:34:11.559The Alliance: That they mistakeÉ they haven't read their Richie Davidson, so they don't know the difference between states and stages, right? Flow is a state, it's not a developmental stage. Enlightenment is a developmental stage, so they're different in the brain. One's temporary, and it's a peak.24300:34:11.590 --> 00:34:17.380The Alliance: One's lasting, and it's a shift in perspective, right?24400:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.369Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: the torque.24500:34:18.570 --> 00:34:34.879The Alliance: so Satori is brief. When enlightenment is lasting, the Japanese use a different term. And so there's a term for flow, and for all these experiences, every religion, that what weÉ what has beenÉ what we have done, what we've fetishized, my guys.24600:34:34.880 --> 00:34:45.430The Alliance: meaning, like, me, Andy Newberg, Shahar, Arzi, all my team, is we've taken it apart quietly, because we don't want to piss people off. We've taken apart many of the holy texts.24700:34:45.429 --> 00:34:56.039The Alliance: So, the best is Shahar Arzi, who's at Jerusalem University, teamed up with Moshe Adel, who's the world's most famous Kabbalist. Shahar is a neuroscientist.24800:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.550The Alliance: in Kabbalistic Judaism, which is Jewish mysticism, there's a bunch ofÉ24900:35:01.580 --> 00:35:26.329The Alliance: very complicated. Jewish mysticism and Tibetan Buddhism are the two most complicated mystical traditions on Earth from what they ask you to do meditatively. They're visualizations, they're transformations, all kinds of stuff. They're also the only two meditation traditions that will produce flow because of that. They createÉ so most of the other meditations you're doing are not flow. You need pattern recognition for flow.25000:35:26.330 --> 00:35:34.210The Alliance: And so, it's only when, Satoru, you have a Zen breakthrough, you answer an unanswerable question, that's pattern recognition.25100:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.259The Alliance: And that's flow. That's how you get to it. That's the flow trigger, right? SoÉ25200:35:38.260 --> 00:35:46.629The Alliance: Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism and Kaolistic Judaism are the only two systems that I know of.25300:35:46.710 --> 00:35:57.929The Alliance: That are complicated enough to actually produce flow because they stack pattern recognition, and they do really complicated stuff. There's a thing in Kabbalistic Judaism from the 13th century25400:35:58.250 --> 00:36:08.790The Alliance: Where you can meditate and have the inverse of an out-of-body experience. You project a doppelganger, you see yourself as Oracle, and you ask yourself questions. And they wanted to know, was this.25500:36:08.790 --> 00:36:09.450Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Oh, gosh.25600:36:09.450 --> 00:36:23.800The Alliance: So they duplicated the experiment from the cobble up in a brain scanner. And so, like, and now they know it's the inverse of the out-of-body experience, it's the same mechanism flipped around. One time predicts your consciousness, another predicts your actual25700:36:23.800 --> 00:36:38.119The Alliance: physical being, blah blah, and so that's the, like, that's what weÉ that's the stuff my team does now. We just don't talk about it because people go fucking crazy when they think you're telling them that God isn't real, and É25800:36:38.300 --> 00:36:54.700The Alliance: It's also, like, if we were to do this publicly, Andy's wanted to write a book about it, and I'm like, we can't do it, because if we include the Muslims, somebody's gonna try to kill us for the rest of our lives, and if we exclude the Muslims, they're gonna hang us, because we're two Jews who excluded the Muslims from our book, on religious.25900:36:55.230 --> 00:37:08.919The Alliance: So we can't do, like, there's noÉ there's noÉ we can't write that book. We can just hope to write that book, but right now, in the world today, that book will get us killed or, canceled, and neither are okay. So, it's too dangerous, we put it alone.26000:37:09.430 --> 00:37:17.919Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's wild. Well, and I thinkÉ yeah, that wasÉ I actually can't see my screen again, you're blacked out, so I can't see the time, so you'll have to cut me off when we'reÉ when we're out of time.26100:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.500The Alliance: I'm cutting you off in 2 minutes, also because you have to go into the meeting with Ryan.26200:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.669Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I know, and I'm hoping.26300:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.139The Alliance: of it.26400:37:23.140 --> 00:37:41.630Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: This screen works, I gotta get my computer. But É that was one of the things, was, É so, like, when you're going to write these papers, you kind of answered it, because that's my struggle, is I don't like to put anything, like, written out, likeÉ like, I guess it's how I frame it, right? Like, unless it's actually proven.26500:37:41.670 --> 00:37:59.329Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: But then there's also, like, for me to say, like, that's not real, because it's not yet, you know, scientifically proven, when there's a whole group of people that, you know, kind of anecdotally, they're like, well, yeah, that is real, that does work, for example. I don't have a good example off the top of my head, but, like, that's kind of where I get, likeÉ.26600:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.600The Alliance: What I would tell you to do is the follow.26700:38:04.880 --> 00:38:19.880The Alliance: you'reÉ you have an error in your statement, but it's only a single one, which is, this is real based on these criteria, which is how I'm measuring and validating this experience. You may have different criteria.26800:38:20.730 --> 00:38:34.240The Alliance: You might have one criteria that is real for you personally, and one criteria that might be, like, real enough that you would teach your children, and another criteria that might be real enough that you would talk about it with strangers.26900:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.560The Alliance: Because we don'tÉ real is a sliding scale. It's always a sliding scale. There is no such thing as real. AllÉ the only thing science.27000:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.040Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.27100:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.660The Alliance: is a global.27200:38:43.730 --> 00:39:00.310The Alliance: language. It's the only agreed-upon global language, which has been the problem in all the wisdom traditions, is we all seem to be saying the same thing, we're using different languages, we have an agreed upon language, we have an agreed-upon scale for validity, and all it is, is27300:39:00.310 --> 00:39:04.659The Alliance: A best guess, made by a bunch of people based on27400:39:04.660 --> 00:39:14.729The Alliance: of the most rigorous criteria they could come for investigating this question, from theÉ like, that's all you got. And science shouldn't beÉ27500:39:14.760 --> 00:39:26.309The Alliance: turned into something it's not. It's a best guess. It's an educated best guess. Often wrong, just not wholeheartedly wrong, like Jesus walked on water, right?27600:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.850Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah.27700:39:26.850 --> 00:39:32.829The Alliance: Usually just, like, partially wrong. I always say that you have to remember when you talk to people, science is27800:39:33.080 --> 00:39:40.530The Alliance: Rarely, or rarely entirely factually accurate, it is usually directionally accurate.27900:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.250The Alliance: Right? Like, a simple example is we thinkÉ28000:39:46.330 --> 00:39:57.470The Alliance: based on complexity and similarity across scales, that there should be a grand theory of everything that unites the universe, right?28100:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.039The Alliance: Bridges Graham General Relativity. Right, yeah.28200:40:00.040 --> 00:40:18.320The Alliance: quantum gravity, just based on the fact that we have an intuitive reaction to simple equations, that we deem them aesthetically beautiful and spiritual, and based on the fact that there are simple equations at every other level of scale, based on that evidence, we think there's a unifying28300:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.290The Alliance: theory of everything. Now, if youÉ28400:40:22.140 --> 00:40:30.109The Alliance: didn't have that language, and I came to him and went, hey, I can explain how everything works. She would say, oh, that's great, that'sÉ we call that God.28500:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.350Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right.28600:40:32.350 --> 00:40:36.299The Alliance: Right? So there's, like, there'sÉ again, like.28700:40:36.470 --> 00:40:43.770The Alliance: where are you drawing the lines around the quest? Is God the Creator, the creation, both at once?28800:40:43.790 --> 00:40:56.340The Alliance: If God is the Creator, is an independent clockmaker? Is itÉ you know what I mean? Like, what is the right narrative perspective to tell the story from, is really the question you're asking.28900:40:56.340 --> 00:41:08.110The Alliance: And, and the answer is most likely, and this is the only thing we can say for sure, is based on experiences on, say, ketamine, psychedelics, etc, or even during orgasm.29000:41:08.380 --> 00:41:14.840The Alliance: There's more going on in reality that we are very well aware of, and how that web comes together.29100:41:15.440 --> 00:41:27.900The Alliance: Probably needs a greater toolset than science currently offers us, but it doesn't change the fact that this is agreed-upon language and a best guess based on, globally determined shared criteria of the time.29200:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.650Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, yeah.29300:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.190The Alliance: Right? Of the time.29400:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.609The Alliance: And by the way, there's nothing new here. This is the other thing I always point out to people.29500:41:38.940 --> 00:41:44.490The Alliance: the church, the Catholic Church, Spends more time29600:41:44.490 --> 00:42:07.280The Alliance: trying to disprove miracles by a factor of 10,000 than trying to prove miracles. They don't want to prove a miracle. They don't want to count on it. It takes 3 miracles to make a saint, they don't want to make a saint. It's too much fuss, it's too many problems, it's too much everything. They would like most of those saints to stay back in prehistory, because nobody wants to seek Jesus in a grilled cheese. It's bad.29700:42:07.640 --> 00:42:16.939The Alliance: for PR. It's just bad for PR. And, that's, like, you have to, like, you have to understand that, like, they tried to disprove29800:42:17.030 --> 00:42:35.950The Alliance: a lot of this stuff. This is not just scientists, this is what the JewsÉ I mean, Judaism is literally an argument with God. It's not a religion, it's an argument with God that's been going on for longer than any other living argument. But Jews are like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Bad design! You shithead, explain yourself!29900:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.259The Alliance: That's a lot of what Judaism is.30000:42:39.580 --> 00:42:53.310Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: That's crazy, yeah, and to me, it's like theÉ because even in this thing, like, I was looking at Scott Barry Kaufman's, like, in his book, Transcend, where it's, like, love versus non-love, because to me, that's more likeÉ like, if it's love, that's God.30100:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.910Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Right? So it's like, what would love do? Is there love here?30200:42:56.910 --> 00:43:14.609The Alliance: I mean, so, Stephanie, you're talking to aÉ this is the last thing I'll say to you that I have toÉ you're 15 minutes late, then I'll go, but, like, honest to God, you might have justÉ you might as well have just said magic fairy dust to me. I don't feel love. The only time I feel love is when I do MDMA, so, like, once a yearÉ.30300:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.260Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Absolutely, wellÉ.30400:43:15.260 --> 00:43:24.699The Alliance: I try to do MDMA, yeah. Like, like, literally, like, once a year, I do MDMA and make out with a stranger, and I'm like, oh, this isÉ30500:43:25.130 --> 00:43:41.320The Alliance: Then I go back to my life, and a year goes by, and I don't think about it again, right? I do a wife, but she doesn'tÉ she's sober, so, like, I can't, like, I can't foist my MDMA self on my sober wife, so, É30600:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.569The Alliance: I outsourced it, with her permission.30700:43:44.930 --> 00:43:51.079Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Okay, well, there you go, there you go, you gotta feel it. I feel love all the time, I feel, like, I mean, for what it is.30800:43:51.080 --> 00:44:04.050The Alliance: It's notÉ IÉ so, I don'tÉ I never use terms like I'm this, or on the spectrum. I try to avoid those terms, because I don't think they're real terms anyways, but I will definitely say that30900:44:04.150 --> 00:44:15.090The Alliance: you know, I've got some ADHD tendencies, and I've definitely got some on-the-spectrum tendencies, and I'm not emotionally blinded like most people, like.31000:44:15.200 --> 00:44:22.089The Alliance: many people I work with, I am blinded to certain feelings. One of them is love.31100:44:22.090 --> 00:44:40.499The Alliance: So, I don't feel it. The only way IÉ like, what I learn is that, oh, you haven't tried to hurt me, oh, you've kept your word, oh, you've stood next to me through really hard things, this mustÉ this is myÉ I have a criteria for this person loves me, and I canÉ I'm safe to love them.31200:44:40.500 --> 00:45:04.819The Alliance: And that is how I do it. IÉ for me, love is a thing that I have to determine scientifically, and I think it's the feeling I feel sometimes when I'm in ecstasy, and having that really, like, just great moment of innocency that goes away in a marriage, really, right? And it's just that, like, you have it with thisÉ you tend toÉ that's why I joke with strangers, but I'm like, you know, sometimes I don't even, like, I just need to have that kind of conversation that you have, where I'm like, oh yeah, I remember this.31300:45:04.850 --> 00:45:12.759The Alliance: this is what that feels like. I remember that. And, it helps. So, honestly, like, I hear you.31400:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.799The Alliance: consider yourself blessed to have that feeling, is what I'm telling you. Like, thankÉ.31500:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.600Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: I feel it, like, all the time.31600:45:18.600 --> 00:45:29.079The Alliance: Thank you, Jesus, Shiva, whoever you're thanking these days, but literally, like, I wouldÉ my life would be very different if I could actually have that feeling.31700:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.720The Alliance: Though I don't think my wife feels it either, actually. I think two, like, peas in a pod on that one.31800:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.160Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: There you go.31900:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.030Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, or maybe it's something different that you don't identify.32000:45:42.620 --> 00:45:51.270Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: maybe when you're in flow, that's, like, love, right? Because I find, like, when I see a beautiful sunset, and it's, like, instant awe, that's kind of flow for me, and I think it's also love.32100:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.390Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: A little bit.32200:45:52.390 --> 00:45:57.970The Alliance: Well, if thatÉ I mean, if you're saying flow is also love, if it's that same sort of feeling, É.32300:45:57.970 --> 00:45:58.830Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yeah, totally.32400:45:59.020 --> 00:46:07.750The Alliance: I don'tÉ Yeah, I mean, once again, like, more in nature.32500:46:08.050 --> 00:46:24.389The Alliance: I see it withÉ like, where I get it with people is in working with people, you know what I mean? Like, I get it with my editor all the time when we're writing, and when, like, you know, I know when he's handling me and I'm handling him with, like, utter care, just to preserve the wonderful thing32600:46:24.390 --> 00:46:35.809The Alliance: that's happening, right? That feels like love. I see that. Okay, that's a broadening of my perspective. Thank you. You kicked myÉ anyways. Alright, I gotta go. Our, É32700:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.370The Alliance: We'll see you in New York, yes?32800:46:40.830 --> 00:46:41.550The Alliance: New York?32900:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.759Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, I'm so excited.33000:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.920The Alliance: It's gonna be soÉ we saw the space. The space isÉ.33100:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.870Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Whoa.33200:46:47.870 --> 00:47:01.039The Alliance: coolÉ like, itÉ I was shocked. I don't know if it's gonna be this shocking in real life, but I literallyÉ I was like, well, I don't think I've seen anything exactly like that. That's really cool. So I liked it. I wasÉ I was psyched by it. Alright, I'll see you in aÉ33300:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.990The Alliance: In a little while, go say hi to Ryan and the others if you're jumping into that. Goodbye.33400:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.460Stephanie Van Deynze-Snell: Yes, I'll try to get my computer working.
