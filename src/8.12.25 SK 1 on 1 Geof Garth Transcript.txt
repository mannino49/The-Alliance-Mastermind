WEBVTT100:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.860Geoffrey Garth: Come on.200:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.889The Alliance: What up, Jeff? How are ya? Nice to see ya.300:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.879Geoffrey Garth: Alright, can you see me?400:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.060The Alliance: I can.500:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.240Geoffrey Garth: Good.600:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.800Geoffrey Garth: I'm, I'm good, up here in Canada. É at, É700:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.859Geoffrey Garth: This new cottage that myÉ well, new, it's a 120-year-old cottage that my daughter bought.800:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.640Geoffrey Garth: I'mÉ I've been workingÉ Hard to get it organized and remodeled andÉ900:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.609Geoffrey Garth: All kinds of stuff, so, É1000:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.210Geoffrey Garth: It was good, it's finally slowing down a little bit. I had time to goÉ1100:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.680Geoffrey Garth: Fishing last night, but, É.1200:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.680The Alliance: Did you really? Good for you.1300:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.609Geoffrey Garth: For the most part, it's been a lot of work.1400:01:37.520 --> 00:01:49.289The Alliance: Yeah, sounds like reading, reading, reading, reading, the, the notes from your call with Ryan, sounds like you've had an exciting month or so.1500:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.570Geoffrey Garth: Well, É.1600:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.039The Alliance: Hey, let meÉ before you dive in, let me just ask you this question.1700:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.479The Alliance: I don't know what you did to your shoulder, but if they're going with cortisol, I'm guessing you tore out your rotator cuff somewhere along the way. É1800:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.199The Alliance: And I've had great success with using, placental matrix and stem cells and1900:02:13.200 --> 00:02:27.640The Alliance: 4 rotator cuffs. I've healed, like, 4 of them with rotator cuffs, and I've gone through, like, I've healed them with surgery, I've healed them with all this stuff, and the stem cells work the fastest, just FYI. Shoulders are fairlyÉ it dependsÉ stem cells, like.2000:02:27.640 --> 00:02:42.110The Alliance: There's so, like, the guy I would sayÉ the guy I would tell you to go see is Matt Cook in San Jose, California, and I could just putÉ I could text interview to him if you want to have a conversation with him, aboutÉ about what's going on. He'sÉ2100:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.970The Alliance: And insurance doesn't cover the shit, but É I don't think you care about that, but IÉ he's been great for me, and whatÉ he'll tell you, and I'll tell you the same thing, isÉ2200:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.249The Alliance: The more complicated the joint, the worse the shit works. Shoulders are really easy.2300:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.439The Alliance: stem cells tend to work great. Backs?2400:02:59.440 --> 00:03:18.979The Alliance: Ankles? Forget about it. Like, ankles have so many moving parts, feet, too many moving parts, they don'tÉ like, they can relieve the pain, but they can't really heal it, but shoulders are actually pretty easy to fix, and Matt's great at it. HeÉ and he works with, like, he's the secret weapon for the 49ers and the Raiders and, you know, a lot of those teams. So I'm having the info if you want.2500:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.010Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, no, I would be interested in that. I mean, it wasÉ IÉ2600:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.359Geoffrey Garth: from sailing up here a couple years ago, I was waking up with extreme pain in my, carpal tunnel, in my hands, and É2700:03:34.360 --> 00:03:47.290Geoffrey Garth: So, after about a year, I had, surgery on my right hand, and that went quite well. It started with an ulnar nerve release that didn't do much, and then he did the carpal tunnel. So, he said, well.2800:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.850Geoffrey Garth: when we do the next side, you know, when you're ready, and we do the next side, I'll do both of those at once. SoÉ2900:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.200Geoffrey Garth: Couple, É3000:03:58.070 --> 00:04:10.969Geoffrey Garth: when, probably, at Christmas time, I did, the second surgery, and É at the conclusion of that, because it was much better, I said, you know, but I got this pain in my shoulder.3100:04:10.970 --> 00:04:22.729Geoffrey Garth: do you work on shoulders? And he said, well, you know, let's get you an MRI. The MRI showed that there was a tear in the rotator cuff and a tear in the bicep tendon.3200:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.599Geoffrey Garth: But nothing that was, you know, torn away kind of thing. So they said, well, É3300:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080Geoffrey Garth: You know, your choices areÉ3400:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.300Geoffrey Garth: cortisone shot, the, É I think what you were talking about, spin down your own blood and stuff.3500:04:40.300 --> 00:05:05.280The Alliance: No, that's PRP. PRP works, really. You can use PRP for rotator cuffs, and I used to do that when I was in New Mexico, because it's so much cheaper, especially in New Mexico, because theyÉ in New Mexico, an acupuncture can do it. Acupuncture canÉ notÉ yeah. So it's like $20,000 if you do it in California, and it's, like, $500 if you do it in New Mexico. Literally, there was, like, 7 years ago.3600:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.109The Alliance: Now insurance covers PRP.3700:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.570The Alliance: SoÉ.3800:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.629Geoffrey Garth: But you're talking about something different.3900:05:11.530 --> 00:05:19.079The Alliance: Yeah, so PRP isÉ they take your blood, they spit it out, and they get the plasma, and they re-inject that.4000:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.669The Alliance: what Matt Cook does is he injects placental matrix, which sort of, like.4100:05:25.730 --> 00:05:49.429The Alliance: is food for stem cells, and it swells up and sort of stabilizes the joint. It feels really good. Like, almost immediately, joints feel better once it goes in there. That dissolves away in about a month. But they also then put in exosomes. Exosomes are what stem cells secrete, so one of the reasons stem cells therapy didn't work so well is because stem cells migrate, so they'll go wherever they're4200:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.220The Alliance: They're needed in the body.4300:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.159The Alliance: they won't stay at a wound site, and so after a week, they're all diffusedÉ they're distributed. But the exosomes4400:05:58.470 --> 00:06:12.129The Alliance: stay in one place, and that's what the stem cells actually secrete that does the healing and the rebuilding. So, they now inject exosomes, and you can do this in America, you don't have to go to Mexico for this.4500:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.960Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.4600:06:13.720 --> 00:06:22.780Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, no, I'd be very interested in that. I've got aÉ I've got a doc, a friend of mine who's, you know, into this stuff. He gave me some, É4700:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.580Geoffrey Garth: the precursor to HGH?4800:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.270Geoffrey Garth: AndÉ.4900:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.280The Alliance: Oh, yeah.5000:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.670Geoffrey Garth: But independent of my show.5100:06:30.670 --> 00:06:42.129The Alliance: You know, the problem with any of that is if you're prone to cancer, that can stimulate cancer. Anything that triggers HDH can stimulate cancer, which is why I stay away from all that stuff, because I smoke.5200:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.210Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, there you go.5300:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.419The Alliance: Well, alright, so let's jump into some Alliance stuff. First of all, seems like you've been getting after the program quite a bit. How's it been treating you?5400:06:54.350 --> 00:07:01.340Geoffrey Garth: Well, I'm not sure where you're getting that sense, because I feel like I've been a slacker, becauseÉ5500:07:01.810 --> 00:07:09.279Geoffrey Garth: I haven't foundÉ I haven't found a place where it makes a difference.5600:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.080Geoffrey Garth: In that, you know.5700:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.690Geoffrey Garth: One of the big things for me from the beginning was this massively transformative purpose, which I haveÉ5800:07:20.440 --> 00:07:40.250Geoffrey Garth: you know, had aÉ been unable to identify something that feels right for me, and there's a part of me that, you know, at 72, I feel like, well, you know, I had aÉ I had a good run, I made a difference for a lot of people with the stuff that we did, but, É5900:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.730Geoffrey Garth: you knowÉ6000:07:42.220 --> 00:07:58.990Geoffrey Garth: You talked about it, starting another company at 50-something, you're not sure you got the energy for it. Well, at 72, that's accentuated. But I, you know, I hear about people who are doing it all the time at 80 and whatnot, but consequently.6100:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.260Geoffrey Garth: you know, I justÉ I feel like I'm going along.6200:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.410Geoffrey Garth: I enjoy the conversations with the others, the few that I've had, and like to think that the perspective that I've been able to bring to some of those conversations has been useful for them.6300:08:16.580 --> 00:08:23.290Geoffrey Garth: But I haven't, É I haven't found things that have been particularly useful for me.6400:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.150Geoffrey Garth: É SoÉ É6500:08:27.550 --> 00:08:36.330Geoffrey Garth: you know, as I say, I mean, I feel like I'm kind of treading water, and, the, creativeÉ6600:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.119Geoffrey Garth: Microdosing stuff, it's sort of likeÉ6700:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.129Geoffrey Garth: you know, I did a couple sketches, É6800:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.949Geoffrey Garth: I don't know, I just haven'tÉ6900:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.450Geoffrey Garth: haven't really engaged. In part because, you know, my time feels like it'sÉ7000:08:52.610 --> 00:09:09.630Geoffrey Garth: you know, it's hard to come up with. I was doing the Passana quite a bit before I was headed out on vacation, and had been doing that for the last, you know, one or two years. Mostly, I was doing Sam Harris's meditation practice, É7100:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.149Geoffrey Garth: And, you know, it was pretty regular, É7200:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.670Geoffrey Garth: Getting a real steady girlfriend has been bad for that, because,7300:09:17.770 --> 00:09:26.149Geoffrey Garth: you know, instead of getting up in the morning and having my routine, I, you know, stay in bed with her and talk and all kinds of stuff. So, É7400:09:26.420 --> 00:09:36.329Geoffrey Garth: So, life's going pretty good, but, I haven't notÉ and one of the things, though, that I have realized is that, justÉ7500:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.240Geoffrey Garth: being in the shop, allows me to get into flow, so I've beenÉ7600:09:42.450 --> 00:09:54.949Geoffrey Garth: renewing, a couple of paddles, up here in this workshop that I've got. And, that's something that I, you know, really enjoy. AndÉ7700:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.350Geoffrey Garth: you know, fixing things and, puttering. É7800:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.029Geoffrey Garth: in the shop isÉ is good for me, I realize, and it's likeÉ7900:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.340Geoffrey Garth: -Oh, yeah. And I realized, well, you know, just do more.8000:10:09.340 --> 00:10:22.949The Alliance: Jeff, this is a crazy idea, because you obviously played around, because we talked about it, I know you did, the whole creative pathfinding architecture, the passion recipe, and all that stuff, and clearly, É8100:10:23.360 --> 00:10:32.549The Alliance: something about that didn'tÉ didn't work for you, or didn't see it to the end, or anything else like that, doesn't matter. But what I was thinking as I was listening to you talk isÉ8200:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.770The Alliance: That might beÉ this might be the exact way8300:10:37.510 --> 00:10:49.789The Alliance: I would have you run the passion recipe. Instead of trying to, like, learn stuff online and see where your curiosity is that way, maybe it's, like, you need 4 or 5 different shop projects that are each8400:10:49.790 --> 00:11:14.770The Alliance: pointed in a different direction you're curious about, and after you've sort of cycled through them, see where they intersect. Because you do seem to likeÉ Ryan's, by the way, is very much like this. When I want to teach Ryan something, when IÉ he has to go build it, otherwise he can't learn it. It won't, likeÉ he won'tÉ he not can't learn it, but he won't learn it to the level that he can start thinking in the language. He needs to buildÉ he needs to build stuff to be able to do it.8500:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.639The Alliance: But maybe that's the way to think about the passion recipe for yourself.8600:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.300The Alliance: That might work, likeÉ8700:11:21.470 --> 00:11:29.550The Alliance: And by the way, remember with Maslow Trash Warner Purposes? I mean, this is a little weird at your age, and I get that, but, like, I always say.8800:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.149The Alliance: they're called Massively Transforming Purposes because Peter and Selene wanted a really fancy name for them, right? I called them missions, andÉ8900:11:40.150 --> 00:12:03.220The Alliance: I, I think a mission lasts 5 to 8 years, and the reason I'm suspiciousÉ I think massively transformative purposes are good for a direction. Like, I care about these things, they matter to me, they're important, but, like, I don't know about you, but every fucking 5 or 7 years, I'm so different. I learned so much stuff over 5 years that I could never predict, like, what's gonna fit9000:12:03.440 --> 00:12:25.000The Alliance: my mission 5 years from now. So I, you know, some people really love the big purpose, but as I said, for me, like, so that might be one way to, first of all, like, chunk it down a little bit, be like, look, okay, massively transforming purpose, perhaps, but, like, what's the 5-yearÉ what's a cool 5-year mission for you that sits at the intersection of, like, 4 or 5 shirts?9100:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.960The Alliance: shop projects. Is thatÉ9200:12:28.190 --> 00:12:34.210The Alliance: thatÉ would that be a successful resolution? What do you think a successful resolution to this would look like?9300:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.160Geoffrey Garth: Well, É9400:12:38.840 --> 00:12:45.859Geoffrey Garth: I mean, one of my goals, key goals, has just been to be able to get into flow moreÉ more often.9500:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.590Geoffrey Garth: É.9600:12:46.590 --> 00:12:52.259The Alliance: Well, that, I mean, it seemsÉ look, it seems like you got into flow, Rescuing a boat.9700:12:52.410 --> 00:13:02.080The Alliance: you got into flow, rebuilding your cabin, and you're getting into flow in your shop, is what it sounded like from your interview with Ryan. So, likeÉ9800:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.210The Alliance: Bum.9900:13:03.650 --> 00:13:14.659The Alliance: I call that a win, because you came in wanting more flow. So, like, I'm calling that a win. I'm gonna take that as a win, Jeff. You may not give it to me, but I'm taking it as a win. Fuck it, man.10000:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.200The Alliance: Yeah, well, É You're bigger than me, but I can run fast.10100:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.859Geoffrey Garth: That wasÉ that was kind of what hit me when I was, you know, in the shop.10200:13:25.100 --> 00:13:32.740Geoffrey Garth: you know, doing these little projects, and the thing is, when I'm in there, I see other little things that I want to do. I come up with other littleÉ10300:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.130Geoffrey Garth: fixes, you know, and that isÉ It's very satisfying to me.10400:13:37.360 --> 00:13:48.419The Alliance: Jeff, this is the other thing that you always have to remember, right? Like, whatever is the thing that you're gonna do next, whatever that purpose is, the MTP, or the mission, or whatever it is.10500:13:49.590 --> 00:14:14.570The Alliance: it only shows up when we're in flow, right? That's why the microdosing and all that stuff with creativity mattered to me. It's not gonna show up when you're fucking doing the work, it's gonna show up during the incubation period as you go from incubation into flow, because you've gotten yourself out of the way, so weird stuff can start to emerge, right? So I think that's, like, I think that'sÉ that's gold, and I, like, IÉ IÉ you know what I mean?10600:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.410The Alliance: not, likeÉ10700:14:15.450 --> 00:14:21.740The Alliance: I sort of think, in a weird way, have you ever read, there's a great book, David Epstein's Range?10800:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.250Geoffrey Garth: No.10900:14:24.250 --> 00:14:39.740The Alliance: You should pick that up, you'll love this book. Do you know who David Epstein is? He's aÉ he's a really greatÉ he's the only other guy out there doingÉ covering science who came out as a journalist who took it as far as I did. He wrote a really fabulous book.11000:14:39.740 --> 00:14:59.549The Alliance: called The Sports Gene, about the genetics of athletics, that was really pivotal. And then he followed this book on range. So there have been 3 challenges to Anders Ericsson's 10,000 hours learning theory. One was mounted by Anders himself, one was me, and Anders agreed with me, and one was David Epstein in range.11100:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.520The Alliance: Epstein basically says, look.11200:15:01.520 --> 00:15:25.579The Alliance: You don't trainÉ expertÉ most expert performers go through big sampling periods at the front end of anyÉ any real project, any mission, where they just try out a bunch of shit, and it doesn't feel connected, and then somehow it connects in their brain. That's what you'reÉ that's what I'm trying to say, is I think you're in a sampling period, and I think you found your gateway into flow in the shop, and just go into the shop.11300:15:25.580 --> 00:15:35.630The Alliance: and just follow your curiosities around for a while. And the only thing I tell you is you've got a lot ofÉ like, I've talked to you enough, and I know you well enough, you've gotÉ11400:15:35.730 --> 00:15:44.510The Alliance: strong ethical stances, strong politicalÉ like, there's stuff you believe in in the world. So, like, just make sure your projects are aligned with your values.11500:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.989The Alliance: I would tinker and see where it leads, and read David Epstein's range.11600:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.940Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, well, you're gonna send me that other info. Shoot me range, too, if you would, just some reference.11700:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.830The Alliance: Well, oh, yeah, let me make a note. What am I doing? I'm working here. I'm supposed to be taking notes.11800:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.760Geoffrey Garth: the, É.11900:16:03.240 --> 00:16:10.919The Alliance: I gotÉ see, this is me getting lazy and letting the AI do the work. It's that quickly. Oh my god.12000:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.480Geoffrey Garth: So, I've been reading, É É12100:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.770Geoffrey Garth: Khan Academy Khan's, book on AI, Khanmigo.12200:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.789The Alliance: Yeah, I interviewed him about that. What did you think?12300:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.399Geoffrey Garth: I think it's great. I mean, when he gets to present it the way he wants to present it, it's like, of course.12400:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.450Geoffrey Garth: What did you think?12500:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.709The Alliance: I think if they don't build a flow layer in.12600:16:39.860 --> 00:16:54.380The Alliance: they're gonna make people stupider and not smarter. If they don't get the interface right, if they don't account for human performance and human biology and their interface design, which I don't see proof of yet, I think they're gonna fuck it up.12700:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.850The Alliance: is Part A. Part B I reallyÉ12800:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.950The Alliance: Between Me, You, and The Wall, I think Sam Altman is dangerous and creepy.12900:17:05.560 --> 00:17:05.950Geoffrey Garth: There you go.13000:17:05.950 --> 00:17:21.709The Alliance: I like ChatGBT as a tool, but he is a person out ofÉ like, IÉ heÉ I think he's a pathological narcissist. I don't, like, he makes me nervous. So, like, I see why Saul partnered with him, but it makes me a little nervous from aÉ13100:17:21.710 --> 00:17:28.769The Alliance: responsibility standpoint, but that's what I think. I think it's cool, I think it's the future, I think the technology is13200:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.489The Alliance: Much less advanced than people are giving it credit for, and É13300:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.990The Alliance: I think that's problematic, but that's what I think.13400:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.269Geoffrey Garth: Well, the, I heard Sam Altman speak13500:17:44.830 --> 00:17:51.650Geoffrey Garth: I don't know, a year and a half ago at the Aspen, Institute stuff, and É13600:17:51.930 --> 00:18:09.419Geoffrey Garth: I had read enough stuff already that I was highly suspect, and I thought that the, É I think it was Barry Weiss, was interviewing him, and just didn't ask any of the hard questions, and so he got to just skate through. It wasÉ I thought it was bullshit.13700:18:09.420 --> 00:18:20.389The Alliance: Yeah, he makes me nervousÉ he makes me nervous. I, like, a lot of them make me nervous, but he makesÉ he makes me nervous. Like, right out the gate, he makes me nervous. Like, some people do evil.13800:18:21.070 --> 00:18:36.699The Alliance: Jeff Bezos is not an evil dude, but he fucked up Silicon Valley when he imported Wall Street values into Silicon Valley, and it sort of broke Silicon Valley. That wasn't intentional, it's just what happened. And it was probably gonna happen sooner or later anyways, and he was just the guy.13900:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.689The Alliance: But all of it makes me nervous. I don't know, could be wrong. But I love ChatGBT, it's my favorite tool. I think he built the best AI.14000:18:43.690 --> 00:18:49.259The Alliance: So, alright, so, É Next question. É14100:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.180The Alliance: If what I'm saying doesn't make sense, and you still want to get towards that mission.14200:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.220The Alliance: What are your ideas?14300:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.860The Alliance: How are you gonna get there?14400:19:05.720 --> 00:19:13.530Geoffrey Garth: Well, É You know, this idea ofÉ Well, you talked about, É14500:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.720Geoffrey Garth: You know, spending 90-minute chunks of focused time, andÉ.14600:19:19.200 --> 00:19:31.289The Alliance: For me, there would be time in the shop, Jeff. For you, that's time in the shop. I would, like, that's exactly what I mean. 90 minutes in the shop, and a little bit of journaling on the back end, just to capture any ideas that come up.14700:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.240Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.14800:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.200Geoffrey Garth: And so that'sÉ that's what came to me the other day, was just like.14900:19:37.240 --> 00:19:52.850Geoffrey Garth: you know, you don't even have to have the project. Just be in your shop, and do whatever is lying on your table. You know, when I go down there, I look at things that I've started, or a little bit, or this or that, or stuff that15000:19:53.330 --> 00:20:11.559Geoffrey Garth: some work has been done, and it's just sort of set aside, and it's like, well, let's put a little more work in on that. And, so I think that's gonna work out pretty well. And I'm excited to do that, hopefully by the timeÉ well, I've been traveling so much, between,15100:20:11.750 --> 00:20:18.119Geoffrey Garth: My girlfriend lives in Aspen, and been up here forÉ15200:20:18.210 --> 00:20:32.849Geoffrey Garth: The better part of the month. I was in Aspen for a week. I was supposed to go back there next week, but theÉ the fire and the smoke and everything, so, it'sÉ it's been a pretty disjointed summer. But, É15300:20:32.960 --> 00:20:38.629Geoffrey Garth: you know, there's a shop up here, so I get to go in there and do some work, too. So, É15400:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.449Geoffrey Garth: Hopefully, by the timeÉ.15500:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.500The Alliance: You know, you know, Jeff, I wouldÉ15600:20:45.640 --> 00:21:01.670The Alliance: I would think about a travel protocol for you. NotÉ it's not really gonna be flowy, but, like, just something that, like, keeps you regulated. Could be a little bit of a pastna with somethingÉ someÉ whatever it is, like, just to, like.15700:21:01.970 --> 00:21:15.480The Alliance: 40 minutes a day, so you have, sort of, that set ritual, that might beÉ because you're bouncing all over the place, and it's justÉ it's really easy to get dysregulated, in my opinion, my experience.15800:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.710Geoffrey Garth: Yeah. Well, I've tried toÉ Try to convince myself that,15900:21:20.970 --> 00:21:35.740Geoffrey Garth: going fishing, which is up here morning and evening, and it's very solitary, and É it's mostly about, you know, casting and being accurate with a fly rod, that that kind of qualifies as.16000:21:36.980 --> 00:21:50.440The Alliance: Well, that'sÉ I mean, that's aÉ that's a perfect recovery-release activity, right? That's just perfect. And, you know, the question is, what do you do when you get asked? You cast when Aspen? What do you do in Aspen? What do you do inÉ16100:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.170The Alliance: Southern California.16200:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.049Geoffrey Garth: Well, that'sÉ those are good questions. In Aspen, IÉ16300:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.479Geoffrey Garth: I'll try and go fishing, É16400:21:59.610 --> 00:22:06.889Geoffrey Garth: there on some of those rivers, but I'm justÉ I'm really trying to understand theÉ the rivers, because, É16500:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.650Geoffrey Garth: Because it's pretty technical fishing, soÉ.16600:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.950The Alliance: Do you know peopleÉ do you know people in Aspen?16700:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.349Geoffrey Garth: A few. A few.16800:22:16.540 --> 00:22:35.680The Alliance: Do you know fishermen in Aspen? I've got a huge outdoor network. I used to live in Aspen. My buddyÉ I've still got a big, like, I know lots of people in Aspen. I could reach out to Chris Gerard and be like, I'm looking for a fisherman to have a conversation with a friend of mine who's been spending a lot of time in Aspen and wants to understand more. Do you want me to do that?16900:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.030Geoffrey Garth: Yes, please.17000:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.190The Alliance: Yeah, that's beenÉ.17100:22:38.190 --> 00:22:51.019Geoffrey Garth: That'sÉ that's what IÉ what I really want, because, you know, I've hired guides, and that's been, you know, very useful. I've got a friend there, and he and I went fishing the other day, and had a better day fishing with him than I did with the guides.17200:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.400The Alliance: And it's justÉ.17300:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.839Geoffrey Garth: You know, the, É17400:22:54.530 --> 00:23:11.480Geoffrey Garth: there are two rivers, as you probably know. There's the frying pan, the pan, and there's the roaring fork. And the frying pan gets so much pressure, that, I'd rather figure out how to fish the roaring fork, because the Roaring Fork I can get to on my electric bike.17500:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.149Geoffrey Garth: From, É fromÉ my girlfriend's house is on Buttermil.17600:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.379The Alliance: Alright, so I, I, I know, now I know, now I know what to ask.17700:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.169The Alliance: Everybody wants tips on how to fish the Roaring Fork.17800:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.230Geoffrey Garth: Yep. Great.17900:23:24.310 --> 00:23:35.240The Alliance: Cool. Yeah. Alright. Let me makeÉ by the way, no guarantees here, but I've got a pretty bigÉ like, I've got a bunch of Aspen outdoor people, and I can't believe they wouldn't know.18000:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.140Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.18100:23:36.140 --> 00:23:41.219The Alliance: We're all hunters and fishermen and, you know, blah blah blah. But anyway, this is, this is, É18200:23:42.050 --> 00:23:58.680The Alliance: This isÉ I said I would open my Rolodex to the Alliance. I didn't think I was gonna be getting fishing knowledge out of it. Wow. Yeah. But, you know, I go where I'm needed. All right, we got, like, 10 minutes left. Is thereÉ what can I help solve for you? What's left? What's a gap?18300:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.460Geoffrey Garth: HmmÉ18400:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.850Geoffrey Garth: Well, we tried to putÉ putÉ18500:24:09.890 --> 00:24:29.279Geoffrey Garth: three of us together on a call, and we could never do it, because I wasÉ Anatoly was in London, the other gal was in Calgary, and I was traveling between Aspen and up here. I was kind of looking forwardÉ not kind of, I was looking forward to that, butÉ soÉ18600:24:29.350 --> 00:24:37.450Geoffrey Garth: the conversations that I've had with people have been the most, useful to me. SoÉ18700:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.199Geoffrey Garth: Facilitating more of that, would beÉ.18800:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.100The Alliance: You're coming to New York, yes?18900:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.479Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, I justÉ I made my reservations, so I'm coming to New York.19000:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.990Geoffrey Garth: I can rememberÉ.19100:24:49.990 --> 00:24:56.499The Alliance: That is gonna beÉ that is gonnaÉ I don't know what's gonna happen. I really don't know what's gonna happen.19200:24:56.750 --> 00:25:12.890The Alliance: I can tell you it's gonna be fun, or funny. It's gonna be one of the two. Like, I thinkÉ I mean, it could be a total fucking disaster, I don't know. There's a lot of variables. Mainly, I'm letting Scott Barry Kaufman do a 45-minute mentalism show about19300:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.320The Alliance: psychology.19400:25:14.730 --> 00:25:21.920The Alliance: At the same, like, weÉ IÉ all I know is when the world's leading creativity expert wants to do a magic show.19500:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.470The Alliance: You let it. You just get out of it, you're like, yes, okay.19600:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.150Geoffrey Garth: É Yeah.19700:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.370The Alliance: É19800:25:28.760 --> 00:25:40.100The Alliance: And as an old magician, I love it. And I wanted someÉ I wanted some bit of entertainment at the last one, so, like, it worked out really great. Cohesive, but it's gonna be interesting.19900:25:40.370 --> 00:25:50.189The Alliance: Yeah, I willÉ Jeff, I willÉ let meÉ I think I gotta follow my sword on this one. I've gotten a lot of feedback from people about, like, all the different things in the Alliance, andÉ20000:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.440The Alliance: É20100:25:52.390 --> 00:26:04.679The Alliance: people have really liked different things, but the thing that did not work is the feedback buddy system. Because even for the people who got in the room with the right people, there was too much divergence in the group.20200:26:05.020 --> 00:26:21.520The Alliance: for it to work, and for it to be really helpful to certain people, and I wasÉ that was one of the things I didn't know, right? That was one of the things we were going to test, and I think this is one of the thingsÉ this is the thingÉ one, it was hard for people to coordinate schedules, so there was a bunch of that.20300:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.970The Alliance: And two, the people who got into them, they were so, sort of, like, different in industries, and I thinkÉ20400:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.840The Alliance: For a bunch of the people who are20500:26:33.240 --> 00:26:49.960The Alliance: maybe they've had more traditional careers than we have. They're used to thinking only in one box, and it's really hard for them to kind of, like, give feedback. Like, I can give feedback in almost any discipline pretty quickly that's semi-useful.20600:26:50.420 --> 00:27:00.239The Alliance: Because I can justÉ I know what questions to ask, you know what I mean? Like, I don'tÉ I don'tÉ I don'tÉ I have no technical knowledge, I just know what questions to ask, but É É20700:27:00.240 --> 00:27:10.540The Alliance: people have had problems with that, so I thinkÉ I don't know what that means going forward, but I think this is, likeÉ like, this isÉ you're not the only one on this, and I think this was, É20800:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.240The Alliance: Yeah, it was theÉ it was theÉ I think it was the fail. Like, some of this stuff worked so muchÉ20900:27:18.280 --> 00:27:35.590The Alliance: better than I expected, and some of this stuffÉ well, okay, not asÉ not exactÉ I don't know how to do it, exactly. I mean, I can train people on what kind of feedback they're looking for, but IÉ matching people together for that is aÉ is trickier than thought, unless I sort of put people on a buddy system over a long period of time.21000:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.329Geoffrey Garth: So, so, are you going to, É21100:27:40.680 --> 00:27:52.779Geoffrey Garth: provide a summation at theÉ at the back end. This is, you know, just like this. This is what I wanted to try, this is what worked, this is what didn't. You know.21200:27:53.140 --> 00:28:09.899The Alliance: You know what, Jeff, I mean, chances are, knowing me, well, here's what I think. I don't know if I'm gonna do it at our event together, because really our event together is about some, like, cool stuff, some time for the group to hang out with the group, and, for us to, like.21300:28:10.130 --> 00:28:28.740The Alliance: sort of load upÉ according to Michael and Ryan, I've been piloting the protocol. I don't know what the protocol looks like. I know what the end result looks like. It's gonna take about an hour, hour and a half to be able to load up the AI so we can use it to really determine, you know, like, map you out for the next year.21400:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.800Geoffrey Garth: Well, my sense of it would be not to do it there.21500:28:33.800 --> 00:28:46.019The Alliance: No, I don't thinkÉ yeah, that was my answer to you, Jeff, isÉ I'm sorry, I forgot there was a question there. The answer is yes, I agree with you. I think I'm gonna wait till, like, two weeks to a month after New York.21600:28:46.200 --> 00:28:55.310The Alliance: And just get everybody together on a digital call, and doÉ I always like after-action summits, you know what I mean? I also believeÉ21700:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.010The Alliance: And, É21800:28:57.340 --> 00:29:09.479The Alliance: I don't think this training is going to be any different. IÉ I was wondering if we could puncture it a little bit by going for 4 months, but it doesn't seem to be true, because all this stuff works like compound interest.21900:29:11.360 --> 00:29:22.800The Alliance: like, you just had a cool breakthrough. Hey, my shop time is really high flow, and this is a path forward for me, and can lead to some interesting stuff. But it took you, like, three and a half months to get there, or three months to get there.22000:29:23.520 --> 00:29:41.290The Alliance: I think we'll see the real results 6 months from now, 8 months from now. I don't think the allianceÉ I said this to my team, I was like, I don't think anybody's gonna be able toÉ you can interview people and do exit interviews, and some people may be really excited, but I think we're gonna really find out what worked and didn't 6 months from now.22100:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.360Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.22200:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.260Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.22300:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.470Geoffrey Garth: Yup.22400:29:45.470 --> 00:29:53.350The Alliance: But you know, I mean, you know me, I'm cautious and cynical and skeptical, and I'm like, let's just, you know, let's see.22500:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.740Geoffrey Garth: Just go for it.22600:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.109The Alliance: Have you hadÉ are youÉ are you glad you did it?22700:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.770Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, I mean, frankly, it's a lot of money.22800:30:04.020 --> 00:30:17.339Geoffrey Garth: I told myself, fuck it, you know? I mean, you've been studying creativity all your life, so, you know, go for it. I would, É I'd feel better if there was some concept that22900:30:17.760 --> 00:30:26.679Geoffrey Garth: At least those who cared to were gonna be able to continue in some quasi-organized way to interact.23000:30:27.490 --> 00:30:39.849The Alliance: We're gonna figure that. I'm gonna fi- IÉ the answer on, like, don'tÉ that's gonnaÉ I think that's gonna happen. I don't know what that's gonna look like, one way or the other. I'm not sureÉ I'm not sure howÉ23100:30:39.850 --> 00:30:50.910The Alliance: how I'm looking at that, but I, I think it'd be a shÉ it'd be a waste to build a group like this and just totally just, like, okay, you know, let's totallyÉ23200:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.630The Alliance: sense. That doesn't make any sense to me. I don'tÉ there's, É23300:30:57.110 --> 00:31:10.470The Alliance: the biggest problem I have is that you guys end in September, and my life is really crowded through April. So the question is.23400:31:11.010 --> 00:31:35.630The Alliance: I think that IÉ if IÉ I may just do a one-day event for the group somewhere along the way, you know, maybe a pop-up, or maybe just a formal thing, I don't know, just to, like, so we don't lose all the momentum. I don't know that yet. That'sÉ my team has been thinking about that a lot, too, because they're trying to figure everything out inside of my schedule and the company's schedule. But, I agree with you. IÉ IÉ like, I want23500:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.919The Alliance: it to go that way, too.23600:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.289Geoffrey Garth: Well, that was kind of a conversation.23700:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.589Geoffrey Garth: that I had with some of the people, when we were up in San Francisco.23800:31:46.600 --> 00:32:01.729The Alliance: Yeah, and we had it, yeah, weÉ I heard it in San Francisco, we had it again when I was with, Stephanie and Brian in Oregon. TheyÉ theyÉ theyÉ they hadÉ everybody'sÉ a lot of people have expressed the same interest. It's really, like.23900:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.499The Alliance: It's really just a question of time.24000:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.829The Alliance: sort of, like, what's gonnaÉ one of the things IÉ one of the things, Jeff, that I think is reallyÉ24100:32:13.270 --> 00:32:21.430The Alliance: you know, I sort of, like, in these conversations, I'm talking to people about what did you like, what didn't you like, what would you want going forward, ifÉ you know what I mean? So, likeÉ24200:32:21.590 --> 00:32:30.680The Alliance: I'm learning along the way, too. I don't quiteÉ I agree with you, I wanted to go forward in some way. I'm not sure what the configuration looks like.24300:32:31.470 --> 00:32:35.469Geoffrey Garth: Yeah. Well, I mean, one thought would be.24400:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.779Geoffrey Garth: you know, I've gone back and I've looked at some of the reading texts and stuff in theÉ24500:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.659Geoffrey Garth: Looked at the length, the number of things that have been recommended as reading.24600:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.509Geoffrey Garth: I can imagine if youÉ took aÉ24700:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.650Geoffrey Garth: An item, and said, you know, just like a book club.24800:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.840The Alliance: Dude, IÉ so IÉ Jeff, I want you to know.24900:33:00.380 --> 00:33:14.980The Alliance: Blair said the same thing to me 4 days ago, and I had the ideaÉ so one of the things I've always wanted to do, but haven't doneÉ Michael Menino and I do it. We pick aÉ we pick a hard science book.25000:33:14.980 --> 00:33:22.139The Alliance: and we read it together, and we book club it, and we meet, you know what I mean? So, like, I, likeÉ25100:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.610The Alliance: I, I will tell you, like.25200:33:28.580 --> 00:33:33.140The Alliance: There is something about, like, a once-every-six-weeks25300:33:33.380 --> 00:33:47.320The Alliance: book club. I'd like to do it, like, IÉ once a month isÉ I've noted, people don't read theÉ like, that'sÉ that'sÉ like, they don't read like I read, you know what I mean? So, like, É.25400:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.699Geoffrey Garth: The first thing, the first thing I would do is I would recommend that you pick a book that is on Audible.25500:33:53.930 --> 00:34:11.740Geoffrey Garth: Because I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who rarely sit down with a book and read it. I listen to books all the time on Audible. And so, I mean, there's someÉ if people want to read it, and it's, you know, obviously, it doesn't make it Audible without being readable, without it actually being a book, butÉ25600:34:11.739 --> 00:34:27.149Geoffrey Garth: If you were to do that and say, in 6 weeks, we're gonna have a review, you know, and anybody wants to be in it, you know, you're gonna be in it, or you're not gonna be in it, and the rest of us do. You know, at some level, you've assembled a group of, ofÉ25700:34:27.190 --> 00:34:45.860Geoffrey Garth: you know, tremendously interesting people. And, so if it's just four of us who are having the conversation, even if you're not available, if you're available, so much the better. If Michael Menino's available, so much the better. I don't know if you remember, but when I took Zero to Dangerous.25800:34:46.139 --> 00:35:04.189Geoffrey Garth: I was kind of in the same situation, where I wasn't all that satisfied with stuff. And you said, well, what did you like best? And I said, what I liked best was Michael Menino in the conversation. He said, well, let me get you set up. So, I had sessions with Sarah Sarkis, and then there was another fellow who was a, É25900:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.240Geoffrey Garth: a sports guy out of, British Columbia.26000:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.300The Alliance: Bertram.26100:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.980Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, andÉ.26200:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.010The Alliance: You, I mean, like, you do realize those are 3É26300:35:15.140 --> 00:35:33.639The Alliance: geniuses. Like, that's aÉ like, it's the craziest thing in the world that, likeÉ there was a period of time where Scott Barry Kaufman, Chris Bertram, Sarah Sarkis, and Michael Menino were all coaching for me, and it was literally, like, you've got my favoriteÉ the best clinical psychologist in the world.26400:35:33.640 --> 00:35:40.009The Alliance: the best creativity expert in the world, Menino, you know, it was just crazy.26500:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.569Geoffrey Garth: Well, you don'tÉ soÉ.26600:35:42.570 --> 00:36:00.550The Alliance: I hear you on the book club, and I heard Blair, and the thing about the book club is, it works for me. Like, realÉ like, you don't have toÉ like, you had me at book club, you know what I mean? Like, IÉ because I justÉ what I've been saying all along is, I gotta find this a wayÉ I gotta find a way to make itÉ26700:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.589The Alliance: Profitable enough that it makes sense to the company to do it.26800:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.240The Alliance: and on.26900:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.799The Alliance: fits enoughÉ fits naturally enough with what IÉ what I want to be doing. Look.27000:36:11.970 --> 00:36:21.219The Alliance: Dude, I still think people training the same flow triggers at the same time and talking about it every month is worth a damn.27100:36:22.610 --> 00:36:28.259The Alliance: I still think that that kind of cross-trainingÉ because weÉ you do it in sport.27200:36:29.040 --> 00:36:44.789The Alliance: And we do it in physical sports all the time. You share beta. It's what you do. And to not do it with cognitive performance doesn't make any sense to me. So I still, like, IÉ like, I'mÉ I'll sort of live and die on that hill, because I think it's so important.27300:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.990Geoffrey Garth: Well, É27400:36:48.110 --> 00:37:02.540Geoffrey Garth: you know, I'm all for that, but when you say it's gotta be economically, you know, it's gotta work for you guys as a company, and this, that, and the other thing, you know, my attitude would be minimize your investment in it.27500:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.340Geoffrey Garth: To where it's not an expense that's a problem, or, you know, it's simplyÉ27600:37:07.430 --> 00:37:27.320Geoffrey Garth: you coordinated, Ryan sends out, you know, this is the book, you've thought about what book would make sense, kind of Menino's thought about what book would make sense, and É then, you know, you set us loose, and it, you know, and you're gonna want to be in on that book club six-week phone call, because it'll be interesting, you know?27700:37:27.320 --> 00:37:36.200The Alliance: Oh, no, I agree. I justÉ Jeff, here's what I'm thinking, so, likeÉ My planÉ what I wouldÉ27800:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.240The Alliance: I don't know what this is gonna look like, and there's gonna beÉ27900:37:39.640 --> 00:37:56.450The Alliance: I think there'll be two tiers, it's just a guess. There'll be, like, a tier where you can get some one-on-one coaching with me if you want it, and that'll be more expensive, and you might be able to, like, opt in and out. And then there'll just be a standard tier, and if I can do it right, the standard tier28000:37:56.830 --> 00:38:13.870The Alliance: is gonna have, like, it'll be something each month book club, like we just talked about, maybe something else, peak performance, again, maybe led by me, maybe not, and then I want to do two gatherings a year. If I run a normal alliance, like a four-month alliance.28100:38:14.180 --> 00:38:23.529The Alliance: IÉ on their finale, I can have their finale day one, and have a second day where I bring in the old members, and everybody can meet together and hang out together. WhichÉ28200:38:23.530 --> 00:38:35.400The Alliance: sort of makes sense, and then I can just do another live event during the year, and the reason I've been leaning towards another live event a year is what I really want to do there, and it's really about finding the right corporate partner for it.28300:38:35.400 --> 00:38:45.609The Alliance: is I want to do a one-day flow conference, where we bring in all the experts from around the world who have made all the discoveries each year, and, like, just a standard flow conference, but one doesn't exist.28400:38:45.610 --> 00:38:59.040The Alliance: I'd love to start it, but it needsÉ that needs aÉ that needs a sponsor, that needs an endowment, a corporate partner, to do it, because you can'tÉ those speakers, a lot of them are in Europe, they'reÉ you gotta pay them, and there's stuff there that, like.28500:38:59.110 --> 00:39:08.469The Alliance: I don't want to have to make enough money. Like, it's hardÉ it doesn't makeÉ for me to put my team on selling a thing that's a $1,000 ticket.28600:39:09.020 --> 00:39:23.290The Alliance: versus a $50,000É like, I could sell one seat at a CEO weekend for $50,000 versus, you know, the same amount of work to sell a ticket. So I'm not, like, that's not gonnaÉ that's not gonna work, and my team will rebel.28700:39:23.290 --> 00:39:36.159The Alliance: Chase will be like, fuck, we're not doing that. Ryan will say, no, it doesn't make sense. So, like, and they're, like, IÉ IÉ you know, I run a collaborative team. If Chase is like, that doesn't make sense financially, I don't want to sell it, we don't sell it.28800:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.989Geoffrey Garth: Yeah, well, as I say, my sense of it is that.28900:39:45.800 --> 00:39:52.180The Alliance: But IÉ but here's the thing that I like about this, Jeff. You just gave meÉ The simplest, like.29000:39:52.890 --> 00:39:59.780The Alliance: you know, the simplest thing I can do to keep this moving, you know what I mean? And, É29100:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.850The Alliance: And it's really low friction, andÉ29200:40:02.970 --> 00:40:15.249The Alliance: you know, we could add in a, you know, meet-up skiÉ or a, you know, a single-day event in Tahoe in the winter, ski day, dinner, andÉ29300:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.119The Alliance: That could be, like, what we do for the next 6 months.29400:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.489The Alliance: So that's a good idea. Alright, I need to jump.29500:40:22.750 --> 00:40:27.250The Alliance: I will see you in New York. By the way, Jeff, let me ask you one question.29600:40:27.550 --> 00:40:32.619The Alliance: Are you generally satisfied with things in your life, or are you generally dissatisfied?29700:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.620Geoffrey Garth: I'm generally satisfied.29800:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.670The Alliance: How are you?29900:40:37.910 --> 00:40:42.210Geoffrey Garth: Well, É Yeah.30000:40:44.750 --> 00:40:49.019The Alliance: I'm not. I, like, I reallyÉ I sort of come inÉ30100:40:49.360 --> 00:40:53.929The Alliance: either, like, it's either extraordinary, or it's just about what I expected.30200:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.119Geoffrey Garth: In terms of your life?30300:40:59.270 --> 00:41:10.340The Alliance: Yeah, I could, like, I could be, like, I am somebody who is, like, I got really high standards, so I can be dissatisfied with stuff, but I can also be easily blown away, by things.30400:41:10.690 --> 00:41:22.370The Alliance: And again, like, I go intoÉ when I go into these kinds of experiences, I, like, I don't go in looking for something huge. I think at my level, I can getÉ I can walk out the other side with 1-2%,30500:41:22.490 --> 00:41:27.140The Alliance: more leverage. At my level, that's fucking enormous.30600:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.329The Alliance: I can turn that into a lot of things.30700:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.250Geoffrey Garth: Well, you know, IÉ I relayed this story, É30800:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.819Geoffrey Garth: In one of our group sessions about,30900:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.779Geoffrey Garth: going up and, signing up with a guy to go and do, MDMA.31000:41:44.920 --> 00:41:51.429Geoffrey Garth: And this guy was a, you know, a coach, as it were, you know, etc. So, I went up, and É31100:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.330Geoffrey Garth: I was underwhelmed.31200:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.860Geoffrey Garth: I hadÉ31300:41:57.010 --> 00:42:08.029Geoffrey Garth: been following, Doblin's work with, maps and the whole, PTSD stuff, and I expected something that was gonna be, you know.31400:42:08.160 --> 00:42:21.340Geoffrey Garth: substantial. And so, when I had the experience, it was very, very modest. It wasn'tÉ it wasn't really what I was expecting, certainly not what I was looking for. And, É31500:42:21.670 --> 00:42:30.039Geoffrey Garth: theÉ But, over time, and the guy said, you know, let's talk about it some more over time.31600:42:30.750 --> 00:42:43.740Geoffrey Garth: while it was fairly subtle, it did make a significant difference for me, that I came to realize that I didn't see as I walked out, as it were. And so, É31700:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.759Geoffrey Garth: So, yeah, sometimes, you know.31800:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.650The Alliance: items.31900:42:49.170 --> 00:42:53.169Geoffrey Garth: Underwhelmed, but then realized, oh, no, that was significant.32000:42:53.620 --> 00:43:00.400The Alliance: What IÉ the only reasonÉ the thing that I think about the most, my experience with that, is SoÉ32100:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.000The Alliance: John Barth.32200:43:03.370 --> 00:43:09.820The Alliance: was one of my mentors, right? Godfather of metafiction. I studied him in grad school, blurred my first book.32300:43:10.120 --> 00:43:17.060The Alliance: ButÉ In hindsight, He really gave meÉ32400:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.850The Alliance: But seriously, two pieces of wisdom, really one.32500:43:21.120 --> 00:43:40.140The Alliance: Right? But it was a thing thatÉ it was one of the things that allowed me to build my career. Like, fully build my career. And I've had that experience. Andy Newberg, my great mentor, he gave me a couple, you know what I mean? So, like, when I think about the people I really actually learn from, maybe people learn a ton of stuff.32600:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.160The Alliance: Oftentimes, like, it's just one or two things, and that's what I need.32700:43:45.830 --> 00:43:46.510Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.32800:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.599The Alliance: So I, you know, boom.32900:43:50.100 --> 00:43:59.620The Alliance: Alright, I, thank you. Thank you for your input. This was awesome. I appreciate the book club idea that you cemented it. So now I know one thing I'm doing.33000:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.979Geoffrey Garth: Alright, good.33100:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.110The Alliance: Alright, brother.33200:44:02.110 --> 00:44:10.359Geoffrey Garth: You know, that'sÉ that's what I was saying before. It's like, I hope that my interaction with the people in the group has been helpful.33300:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.090Geoffrey Garth: Because,33400:44:12.090 --> 00:44:18.390The Alliance: Everybody loves you. Everybody loves you. Like, you should come to Vegas this weekend and come see Sublime andÉ33500:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.140The Alliance: Pennywise with us.33600:44:20.310 --> 00:44:26.470Geoffrey Garth: You know, those guys, the Sublime and the Long Beach Dub All-Stars, that was all Long Beach, where I lived.33700:44:26.470 --> 00:44:27.120The Alliance: Oh, God.33800:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.040Geoffrey Garth: the drummer for Sublime lived up the street from me, like, 6 houses away.33900:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.200The Alliance: Oh, no shit.34000:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.790Geoffrey Garth: But I was never into their music at all. You know, I'm too old.34100:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.170The Alliance: Yeah, it roared through the action sports world, likeÉ34200:44:43.430 --> 00:44:53.699The Alliance: Nothing I'd ever seen. Sublime was everywhere for, like, two, three years before Bradley died. He just took over the action sports world, that was for sure.34300:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.200Geoffrey Garth: Yeah.34400:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.690The Alliance: I remember, I literally, like, I didn'tÉ34500:44:57.000 --> 00:45:11.310The Alliance: I was on a bus doing a story about pro bump camps, and it was kids. Like, I was the oldest guy on the bus, I think, and they were rocking a boombox with Sublime, and I was like, what is this? This is good.34600:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.340The Alliance: WellÉ.34700:45:13.720 --> 00:45:30.369Geoffrey Garth: I got a big kick, and I recommended it to some people. Maybe you saw it in the chat, the podcast that you did with the fashion designer, and talking about how funk influenced everything. I found that to be fascinating.34800:45:30.700 --> 00:45:42.519The Alliance: Yeah, it was, É that was a lotÉ I've been working on that for years. John just sort of came in because he had all the footage, and I wanted to work with John, but I've beenÉ I've been working on that34900:45:42.550 --> 00:45:58.849The Alliance: for, like, 20 years, and really thinking about that, because I alwaysÉ it's gonna be a book at some point, I think. But, John and I, we're gonna try to turn it into a thing, because he's gotÉ when he shot that fucking dock he shot thatÉ saw the footage behind us.35000:45:58.850 --> 00:46:04.220Geoffrey Garth: So, I didn't see any footage. I just heard this onÉ onÉ As a podcast.35100:46:04.220 --> 00:46:23.340The Alliance: Hmm. Okay, if you, É it was a talk we gave at Summit, and you can find the talk online, and behind us, the reason I partnered with John is, he hadÉ he bought CBG, because first of all, he's an old punk rocker, and he's great, but he also shot this FX documentary.35200:46:23.430 --> 00:46:33.850The Alliance: And theyÉ FXÉ it was, like, a history of punk or something, and it, like, it is 4 episodes, but they had, like, 10,000 hours in the can.35300:46:33.850 --> 00:46:46.800The Alliance: So, like, he's gotÉ he's literally got interviews, like, with everybody, and they go on forever. So he's got all this shit just sitting around.35400:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.839The Alliance: And he knows everything. He knows the entire punk world. It's amazing.35500:46:52.840 --> 00:47:03.639Geoffrey Garth: So, I've got a final question for you, I'll let you go. There was a friend of mine who had a band that wasÉ that played CB Jeebies. They were called the Oral Fixation.35600:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.620Geoffrey Garth: And he played power tools.35700:47:08.050 --> 00:47:15.849Geoffrey Garth: And they'd get up there, and he'd hold the drill, and there were, like, 4 or 5 of these guys on stage playing power tools, and it.35800:47:15.850 --> 00:47:19.919The Alliance: Yeah, there was aÉ there was aÉ so there were a bunch of those guys around.35900:47:20.030 --> 00:47:27.099The Alliance: for a little while, there was a band out of Utah when I ran Antimatter, the performance art gallery. The bestÉ36000:47:27.630 --> 00:47:44.840The Alliance: show ever. The best thing we ever did was this fucking band out of Utah called Scozy Fetish that played, like, chainsaws inside of garbage cans and, like, you know, all this stuff. That all started with a band called Einstersen den Neueenbaten.36100:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.310The Alliance: That was Nick Cave's original band.36200:47:48.310 --> 00:47:58.390The Alliance: And that's German for Collapsing New Buildings, and they were the original WePlayÉ they were this German noise band, and they played machinery.
