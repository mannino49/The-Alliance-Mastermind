WEBVTT100:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.540The Alliance: The couple.200:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.69030697: Hey! Steve!300:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.490The Alliance: Good morning. How are you.400:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.05030697: I'm doing great. How are you doing.500:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.270The Alliance: I'm excellent. All right, tight time limit. Let's jump in600:09:06.540 --> 00:09:24.810The Alliance: quickly. I wanna just I wanna do a quick through accountability checklist to see what you're leaning into and what you're not. There's 4 flow triggers we've been playing with complete concentration, clear goals, challenge skills, balance and feedback. Which have you been leaning into? What's working? What's not.700:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.73030697: So very heavily into challenge skills, balance, and immediate feedback. So since our last call.800:09:32.772 --> 00:09:46.31930697: even after some conversations with others, I started a sub stack newsletter to play in the space that I was exploring and trying to get to a very focused audience based on your recommendation. Last time. Kind of go go narrow.900:09:46.470 --> 00:10:00.03030697: So it's called navigating AI transitions with wit. And it's focused on helping working parents shape the way AI is going to impact our kids ourselves and our work, and so kind of that triad of1000:10:00.300 --> 00:10:26.65030697: the 3. And I started it last Monday and put up 3 posts last week, and I've got 2 this week and one more coming. My last one actually, yesterday was a 7Êmin audio post with my daughter interviewing her about AI use in school, and some of the realities that the kids are going through, and I've got got my 100 subscribers, most of which I don't know. So they didn't come from a friend network all all organic1100:10:27.252 --> 00:10:33.85730697: you know, actively engaging with several folks on comments and sub stack and and whatnot. And,1200:10:34.530 --> 00:11:03.29030697: you know, feels like the conversation is one that people want to have. And so it's just kind of growing steadily. And actually, one of the guys that I follow, as that has a big AI newsletter I posted in the slack channel. DM'd him. He put it in as one of the things that he's consuming, and this thing that he, his kids, are only 2, but that he wants to think about more. That Newsletter goes out to like a hundred 1,000 people, so that you know that post has gotten. I don't know 1,500 views something like that. I've got over 2,000 views across the different posts. So you know, heavy lean in in that area1300:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.44030697: as far like.1400:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.410The Alliance: Delicious.1500:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.27930697: It's like an uncomfortable space. And but I'm like, I mean.1600:11:08.280 --> 00:11:16.502The Alliance: Yeah, that's so great. And you're getting fast feedback at every level. So you're ticking that box, you hit clear goal. So1700:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.699The Alliance: other. Are we creative microdosing between tasks, are using Vipassana.1800:11:24.110 --> 00:11:36.29930697: So I've done Vipassana a couple times. I do like pure Vipassana sometimes. Sometimes I just honestly like I lay down and close my eyes and breathe, not necessarily listening to the meditation, but I just take like1900:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.05030697: 10Êmin to reset my system.2000:11:40.050 --> 00:11:55.070The Alliance: The only thing I'm going to ask if you're doing that because everything was designed to work synergistically is try to make it an open census meditation rather than a focus meditation. That's where I'm leading everybody towards, because open senses meditations2100:11:55.080 --> 00:12:12.337The Alliance: are shown to amplify creativity. Right? So I'm I'm with the micro dosing as the release activity and the Vipassana. There's sort of met, you know what I mean. It's a multi multi tool approach and2200:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.750The Alliance: I'm with you. Okay.2300:12:13.750 --> 00:12:30.119The Alliance: yeah, it should. You know, if the data again, like this is typical, Steven, there's a lot of the lab data that says, this is what's gonna happen. So I just go into the world and just test it on people and say, Okay, let's see if this is what's gonna happen. Alright. So that's.2400:12:30.270 --> 00:12:38.70030697: And I am drawing like I do. I'm enjoying the sketching. I haven't had a chance to try the writing steel style yet. I will get to that. But I haven't gotten there yet.2500:12:40.700 --> 00:13:10.399The Alliance: Yeah, it's just it's it's there to flex different creativity muscles and sort of get you thinking in slightly different ways. And but I don't mind like. It's more important to me that, like you get there and it becomes a thing you test. If if we get it in this window cool. If we don't get in this window, just report back right like that what I like I I wanna know. But the the thing that you have to. The one thing to know is2600:13:11.480 --> 00:13:34.700The Alliance: my aim is by the la, the end of the the end of this thing. When we're together in New York. We're gonna take, you know, all the data sort of gathered along the way stuff you've learned stuff that's come up in these Co blah blah and try to shape a protocol for you to kind of adhere to for the next year. Kind of thing. So that, all that's all I got got there, but you're kicking along so.2700:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.78930697: That part of it is, I'm like finding my own style writing. So it's like I haven't gone to steal style.2800:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.50030697: And, by the way, by the way.2900:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.649The Alliance: That's happening to you.3000:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.860The Alliance: Don't3100:13:45.120 --> 00:14:00.919The Alliance: don't actually do my stuff. I'll keep drawing if that's happening. Yeah, yeah, actually, in this case, because my stuff will start when you get stuck, when you're a little bored, when your style stops being fresh. That's when the jump jump to mine, because that's when novelty will really help.3200:14:00.920 --> 00:14:08.24930697: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun, just feeling like I'm finding my voice, the rhythm here, different ways to communicate it, so that makes sense.3300:14:08.250 --> 00:14:14.230The Alliance: Alright. So what I'm gonna need to see is some of those drawings integrated into substack. Then I guess.3400:14:14.540 --> 00:14:24.64930697: Yeah, I mean, so far I've been using the I haven't added my own drawing as one of the images for the posts yet. But I could do that going forward. So far I've been having kind of the fun.3500:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.990The Alliance: So I will tell you what I don't.3600:14:28.210 --> 00:14:39.859The Alliance: I find, because I'm so used to, Toby, that I like I can draw. I mean, I literally look out onto the Sierras. I could draw from real life anytime. I, freaking wanted. I'd rather pull up a photo now3700:14:40.040 --> 00:14:51.970The Alliance: and try to like do his style like I. Still, I still do it. So even if I want to draw mountains, I pull up like I'll take a photo sometimes and pull the photo onto my computer and draw from my photo because it's just the.3800:14:51.970 --> 00:15:07.53030697: It's funny. Actually, I did that with my last drawing where I went camping down in Salida, and did like with this men's group. And we just kind of got away and did mountain biking and whatnot, and my my release afterwards was drawing a picture of my campsite, of my tent by the river and going back through and doing that.3900:15:07.530 --> 00:15:15.530The Alliance: That's amazing, though. 2 questions. Question next question is, and4000:15:18.010 --> 00:15:34.900The Alliance: I wanna obviously get to puzzle solving problem solving. And what I can help you work through. But I also wanna know, what have you discovered about yourself in the past since we started that you didn't know? Yeah, I know, like you've really been on a on a bigger adventure than a lot of the folks. You came in hard.4100:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.03030697: I think it's how much.4200:15:40.300 --> 00:16:05.92930697: how much energy I guess enjoy I can get from. Well, it's my mantra like just paddle, you know. I can be over. I can. I can analyze things. I can think I can be introverted. I can, you know, kind of get into rhythms where I feel stuck, and to some degree like just paddling, is mattering more to me right now than knowing exactly where I'm paddling, or even how hard I have to paddle, or who I need to paddle with, just like that movement4300:16:05.990 --> 00:16:12.42930697: is creating a platform from which I feel like I could generate other movement as it becomes clear on where I go.4400:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.610The Alliance: Yeah, I love that you're saying.4500:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.36030697: Battling.4600:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.030The Alliance: Love that you're saying this because it many4700:16:18.150 --> 00:16:26.315The Alliance: people have run into, which is exactly like this is what's next. This is where we're gonna go next. But analysis by paralysis.4800:16:26.810 --> 00:16:27.740The Alliance: and4900:16:28.170 --> 00:16:52.800The Alliance: I think I got lucky because it got so beaten out of me by having deadlines like for as a journalist right? Just deadlines and bosses, and like I didn't have a choice. But if you're not used to that, you can, you can go down that sinkhole really deeply, because it's a muscle. I've learned enough to go forward, and the truth of the matter is, I always tell people is the Mike Tyson rule applies right. Everybody's got a plan until you're punched in the mouth.5000:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.55030697: Oh, yeah. Which?5100:16:53.550 --> 00:17:01.470The Alliance: Which is why we have agile computing. It's why we started introducing products with 4 or 5 features and seeing what happened. And5200:17:01.520 --> 00:17:30.370The Alliance: I really like. I'm a big firm. Believe this is why, my, I play dates. Take your ideas out of the public and bang, you know, pressure test every step along the way, and get moving, because movement creates movement and feedback creates fine tuning. And that right. Do you put those things together? And you've got real momentum, and then the flow that you're getting into along the way isn't wasted. You're getting pushed in the direction you need to get pushed.5300:17:30.990 --> 00:17:46.90030697: Yeah. So I think that's a big thing. I've that's 1 big thing I've learned. And then I think, also, you know some of your stuff around. When's an artificial construct, and even just the the pursuit of this Mtp. Like I've gotten comfortable with like, I don't have to know my Mtp. To make an impact like I can. I can move5400:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.03030697: and5500:17:48.390 --> 00:18:04.78930697: play and engage in these different spaces where I think there is a need, and that may ladder up to a bigger thing. But I'm okay with like, I'm okay with it, not knowing if there is this bigger thing yet, so long as I feel like I'm moving. I'm learning. I'm exploring my curiosity.5600:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.719The Alliance: So I think.5700:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.27030697: Engaging.5800:18:06.270 --> 00:18:14.010The Alliance: Yeah, I well, people think of purpose as a destination.5900:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.35030697: Yeah.6000:18:14.580 --> 00:18:25.420The Alliance: I've never. I think it's a directional arrow, and I think, trying to call it a destination. Actually, you end up thinking smaller than you're actually gonna click!6100:18:26.360 --> 00:18:39.809The Alliance: There got to be a point at some point in my life. Where I was playing bigger than all my expectations. I'd actually done so much more than I like, and I thought came in planning to do a lot. But I was like, Oh.6200:18:39.950 --> 00:18:47.559The Alliance: wow! But I think that's the byproduct of just paddle. Okay, where can we go next? What what seems to be6300:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.609The Alliance: getting your way? What can we massage, or what? What do you? What do? What do you want to tell me about.6400:18:54.620 --> 00:19:16.83930697: I don't know that there's too much getting in my way right now. I'm actually like, really, I feel like I've got good momentum. I think it's what I'm trying to explore is like, what are more venues to have the conversation and get it out to people. I just. I've never been a huge social media player networker, and I don't like it's not about pure numbers, but it's more like I'm enjoying when new voices come into the conversation. And so it's like, How do I tap into those new voices? So I put it on.6500:19:16.930 --> 00:19:36.03930697: Yeah, I put it on Linkedin. I sent it out. I put it on this AI to the guy that runs the AI Newsletter in the slack. There's a local one that I put it on. I'm trying to like. I emailed the principals at my kids schools to see if we can have the conversation there. I'm going to engage the school board around this, like, you know the the use of it in classrooms. So I'm just trying to.6600:19:36.370 --> 00:19:36.800The Alliance: Hey! Chaz!6700:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.32030697: Findings.6800:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.290The Alliance: Suggest, yeah, I suggest6900:19:38.290 --> 00:19:57.730The Alliance: on this one, because I agree with you. It's marketing. And in my job I always say, like, you know, I do 3 things. I try to slot them every day, and then I've got a slot for exercise and recovery, basically. And then I've got a slot, that is all the shit I have to do to do the other stuff that.7000:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.77930697: Yeah, right? And.7100:19:58.780 --> 00:20:18.260The Alliance: And in that slot, is it? It's marketing. Essentially, it's the that. It's all the promotion. And and I don't love it. And the way I've solved it for myself is I do the same thing. I always do. I start out by making a list of a hundred targets that, and I7200:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.619The Alliance: chunk it. So I commit to 5 reach outs a day7300:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.662The Alliance: right? And and one thing7400:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.710The Alliance: So this is a journalist trick7500:20:30.890 --> 00:20:41.291The Alliance: that we use all the time, and it's it's how to get more sources. But it's also a very effective sort of way to poke at this one of the things that like I've done is7600:20:41.750 --> 00:20:51.819The Alliance: When you know people who have big audiences like something of mine, I'm always like as a journalist, I would always. The last question is, who else should I talk to?7700:20:51.940 --> 00:20:59.479The Alliance: Right? Who do you know? Who should I should talk to about the subject? You can do the same thing about thought leaders. So if somebody with a big7800:20:59.530 --> 00:21:23.410The Alliance: network reaches out to you and you're in slight communication, it's hey. I'm really trying to expand my intellectual base here. Who can I talk to about this? Who's a really great conversation about this? And then, you know, you know, can you introduce me, or then you that now you have a name, hey? So and so it's just I got get in touch right? That is a fat much7900:21:23.410 --> 00:21:40.819The Alliance: faster. It speeds up the process a little bit, and what it does is like you'll come up with 100 targets pretty easily. You know what I mean. I would use, Steve. I would go, Steven. On this I would like today, I try to come up with 25 tomorrow, 25. The next day, 25. The next day 25, and then the following day, I contact 5 people, and I just8000:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.479The Alliance: bye and and don't like.8100:21:46.360 --> 00:21:55.340The Alliance: There's probably ways to AI this stuff out and play with that. And there are like different professionals at different levels. But I have to tell you something.8200:21:56.610 --> 00:22:09.470The Alliance: just to put it in context for you. I haven't been on Youtube and fucking forever. And I've only got 5,000 fans. And I'm bad on social media. And we've decided to get serious about it. 2 weeks ago we started testing it8300:22:10.057 --> 00:22:20.219The Alliance: with like new content. We, the good content starts on Monday. We were just testing different things. I gained a hundred 50 followers in a week and a half.8400:22:20.680 --> 00:22:27.899The Alliance: and it's me starting with 5,000. So if you gained a hundred followers in a week. You're doing something really fucking right? Just.8500:22:28.546 --> 00:22:31.13330697: Thanks. Appreciate that validation.8600:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.660The Alliance: Trying to say is.8700:22:33.060 --> 00:22:47.030The Alliance: Wow, that's like you've got lift off right. And the thing about all this stuff is it's exponential. So like as long as you, you know you're doing all the right stuff. Just keep doing it, and8800:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.689The Alliance: with the next step for you is.8900:22:50.780 --> 00:23:17.092The Alliance: and it'll happen, I would guess sooner, sooner than you think. So you should think about this a little bit is you'll get onto podcasts and you'll start people will start inviting you onto podcasts to talk about this, it'll start with small ones. You know what I mean. But like that will start to build as well for you. So like, that's how I would think about it. I'd be like, okay, I need to build followers to podcasts and9000:23:17.750 --> 00:23:33.719The Alliance: you've already got a newsletter, which is great, because that's the thing you need to sell you. That's how you sell people stuff in the end, or you can't sell through social media. You can use social media to funnel, to a newsletter, and a newsletter is is how you sell but9100:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.669The Alliance: and what you, the way you have to think about sales is9200:23:38.530 --> 00:23:54.140The Alliance: the more time you spend in somebody's head, the more likely they are to buy from you. So reading, stuff, is time, watching podcasts is time right? So like I wouldn't try to introduce a product at all for a while.9300:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.14030697: I mean, I'm not even thinking about it. I mean, it might be a year 2 year, like I just want.9400:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.940The Alliance: Yeah, that's what I.9500:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.38030697: I want to play in the space and talk to people. Yeah.9600:24:01.380 --> 00:24:08.115The Alliance: Get, get, get, get, become an expert, build it into podcasts, build it into some speaking stuff. Yeah,9700:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.850The Alliance: I would do like, I would start doing stuff9800:24:13.940 --> 00:24:22.030The Alliance: very quickly. Once you get to like a decent sample size. So 500, I said, running surveys start getting data9900:24:22.110 --> 00:24:39.200The Alliance: because what you're you're gonna need something that distinguishes you from all the other people in this thing. So do your own kind of like loose. So you can say things like we've been, you know, we've been. We've been doing some research for the past. Blah, blah. And this is what this is what we you know. So you can make those kinds of statements.10000:24:39.200 --> 00:24:53.639The Alliance: They're differentiators. Just assume a bunch of people are in this space. You're moving quickly, which is great. You're gonna have a 1st mover advantage, but you need to retain it. You gotta stay a little ahead of the competition, so you could think about that too.10100:24:53.950 --> 00:25:12.65330697: The thing I feel that I find is resonating the most out of the gate is the How do I talk to my kids, or how do I talk through this with my kids of when it's okay to use AI when it's when it's not okay? And like that balance between, what am I gaining by using it? And what am I losing by outsourcing to AI? And is that a positive trade off and10200:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.270The Alliance: So today10300:25:15.620 --> 00:25:22.439The Alliance: I don't know she she's got a she's got a she's got a she's got a daughter, too. I would ask Annie.10400:25:22.440 --> 00:25:22.93030697: Okay.10500:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.660The Alliance: That question. Annie's the one of the most10600:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.399The Alliance: one of the freshest thinkers I've ever encountered on relationships10700:25:32.440 --> 00:25:50.970The Alliance: hardest and freshest across the board, so like, I would just get get her input, I think that's cool. So that's awesome. So yeah, this is so so essentially like the the next steps, not gonna have Ryan hold. You 2 are like a marketing list. Yeah, and 5 reach out today. What's a good number for you?10800:25:51.470 --> 00:26:03.92930697: Oh, I think that's fine. I mean, I'm doing it. I'm pretty like that's kind of what I haven't. I haven't created the master list. But I'm definitely trying, like, every day I'm posting on like some notes on substack, just to drive the conversation, and I haven't done as much of the target.10900:26:03.930 --> 00:26:09.140The Alliance: The only reason I'm telling you to master this is, there's all kinds of stuff you do along the way, but you want11000:26:09.280 --> 00:26:34.940The Alliance: hard targets, and I get really strategic with hard targets. So if I like, like, we wanted to get to Carl Friston for the papers that we were writing on intuition. So we started by finding his graduate students, and then we worked up to his postdocs, and that you know what I mean. Like, it was a targeted approach over a couple of years. I knew exactly what I was doing. I did it very slowly, and you know.11100:26:35.380 --> 00:26:58.39030697: Well, it's interesting like i. 1 of my friends is like Knows sahil Bloom, and he has a bunch of subscribers, and so I sent him a note, and he responded, you know, like he's not doing anything with it yet, but at least started the conversation. He's actually coming to Boulder. So I'm like, I'm finding that who who actually responds and who's behind, you know, not just a a faceless newsletter, but actually will engage their audience. And starting to play with that a little bit.11200:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.22030697: That's dope. Yeah, that's great.11300:27:00.220 --> 00:27:19.40930697: And then the other thing I'm doing, I'm I'm still trying to very much lean into the networks like I, my wife and I and my son went down to Amity's ranch last weekend, and so we got to see her space. We had brunch with her the next day. She just sent me her vision and kind of business, Doc, I'm gonna help her be like a foil for her talking through that she's gonna come up. She's gonna come up to Boulder.11400:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.479The Alliance: Thank you. Thank you.11500:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.77930697: Probably the last week of June to workshop.11600:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.350The Alliance: She needs. Yeah, I think she needs that help.11700:27:26.350 --> 00:27:37.42930697: My wife's gonna actually go down and do the 4 day volunteer work on her ranch later this summer, and like just go like, live the farm life for a few days. That's the 1st thing. So I'm trying to build that relationship.11800:27:37.430 --> 00:27:50.875The Alliance: I think that's dope. I think that's dope. I think it's a great. It's a great cool group. I still can't figure out how I'm gonna keep us going like, what the hell that's gonna look like? I don't. I don't know what the hell that's gonna look like.11900:27:52.510 --> 00:28:00.330The Alliance: I sort of. Think I know what I want to do, but I don't like I don't know how to. I don't. I'm not quite sure how to make it work.12000:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.08030697: Yeah.12100:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.65930697: I mean, I'm happy. If there's if there's ways I can contribute to keeping the group going and.12200:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.069The Alliance: Yeah, I don't. I like.12300:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.64030697: Yeah.12400:28:07.910 --> 00:28:14.380The Alliance: I mean, you know, on a on a certain level, like if what I'm trying to figure out is12500:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.820The Alliance: if we keep it, I mean, like the easiest thing is a monthly meetup where we just do a 90Êmin group12600:28:20.940 --> 00:28:32.709The Alliance: call. That's like, you know, that's easy. That's that's sort of simple, with occasional live events. The where it gets complicated is.12700:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.179The Alliance: how much? How much can I charge people? Because the time12800:28:37.470 --> 00:28:48.239The Alliance: like that time can otherwise be used really valuably for me. And that's so like I. You know that the question is pricing and12900:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.080The Alliance: it seems like some of the people who would like to be in the group13000:28:52.210 --> 00:29:18.280The Alliance: for the long haul. Don't have as much money as some of the other folks, and I know that right. I just know that. So I don't like. That's what I'm actually thinking about. I don't know what the answer sort of there is there, and maybe it's a a tiered, pricing thing I don't like. I'm not quite sure what that's gonna be. I'm thinking about it because I'm liking. I'm really, you know, I was hoping that that the relationships in the Alliance would form.13100:29:18.630 --> 00:29:29.063The Alliance: by the middle of month, 2 to 3. And you guys are like a month ahead of me. You leaped in really fast. So that like, I'm really excited about that. What13200:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.690The Alliance: is anything not working for you?13300:29:33.520 --> 00:29:47.19030697: I don't think I have anything that's not working. I mean, I've been trying to really embrace the program and dig in and learn and like I said I, I came into this looking for movement, and I feel like I've got movement, but I'm and then I also am trying to find the other people that.13400:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.700The Alliance: Creative a lot.13500:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.320The Alliance: Exactly.13600:29:48.320 --> 00:29:48.799The Alliance: All right, are you?13700:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.250The Alliance: Yeah, that was what I promised.13800:29:51.250 --> 00:30:06.96830697: Yeah. And then I you know, I've been trying to really take advantage of the network. I mean, that was a big draw for me was meeting new people talking to them like I've got. I've got a follow up conversation with Blair coming 2 weeks because we only scratched the surface our 1st time, and we overlap quite a bit. So I'm trying to13900:30:07.340 --> 00:30:19.34430697: dig into that. I think. You know, I'd love to do more of that. So if you're talking to people, and you're like, Hey, you know, like you may need some to dig in more between our meetings and need. Somebody else's a foil like I like doing that.14000:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.88030697: I was. I I saw.14100:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.900The Alliance: I we were. So14200:30:26.910 --> 00:30:41.389The Alliance: I slowed things down because everybody was a look. So we were gonna add feedback buddies last month, and we're gonna do it next month. So you guys can start working with people to determine who minimal feedback or flow. So like, you know.14300:30:41.390 --> 00:30:59.389The Alliance: pick a partner, that that kind of thing. We're gonna do in the next 2 weeks, and that will add another. It's another conversation. It's another couple of conversations that you guys are going to be forced to have over the course of the month. I'm a little worried because there's like 4 people in the group who are14400:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.040The Alliance: so busy.14500:31:01.980 --> 00:31:14.579The Alliance: so insanely busy that I'm like, if I like, I I've learned next time, like if I do, I want to put 20 people in the next group, because I don't. I think 15 is actually too small.14600:31:14.580 --> 00:31:14.92030697: Wow!14700:31:14.920 --> 00:31:22.990The Alliance: For the for the amount of interaction I want, because people are so busy. At this level, I think the group needs to grow a little.14800:31:22.990 --> 00:31:51.94930697: Well, it's funny, because, like, I'm on the opposite end of the spec, like, I have like 6Êh of my workday that are unplanned almost every day. I just like I'm kind of making up what I want to do to contribute to the org. I'm like tying between this newsletter and my company so that I can build like I can do some of this stuff, but bring the value back like I just wrote an AI newsletter for my execs to try and keep them up to date, because they're lagging behind. I took some of the concepts from my sub stack and pulled it into there. So I'm like, I'm in this really interesting space where I just have a lot of time14900:31:51.950 --> 00:32:04.83030697: to figure out what I want to do. And it's more like how to. How do I point it? And it may get busy like I expect it to get busier in the next coming months. But I'm trying to take advantage of that period. One question I had for you. You mentioned these like a hard target15000:32:05.030 --> 00:32:21.31030697: given what I've talking about with this sub stack focused on working parents and helping them shape the influence of AI on our work, ourself, our kids, and ourselves. And somewhere, I'm going like, is, are there hard targets that pop into your head of people that you're like? Oh, that would that might be interesting for15100:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.10030697: that person where I can map my path to try to get to them.15200:32:27.250 --> 00:32:27.980The Alliance: So15300:32:29.130 --> 00:32:35.630The Alliance: you have me at a disadvantage because you're asking a kid question, and, as you know, I understand the little fuckers.15400:32:36.577 --> 00:32:38.49030697: Parents, I guess.15500:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.130The Alliance: Well15600:32:39.470 --> 00:32:56.439The Alliance: what what I mean there is. I have an ignorance on that side of the equation on the AI side of the equation. Well, when I when I, when I was listening to you, talk, what I was thinking is, so I have a friend. Mike Koenig is his name, and Mike runs15700:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.830The Alliance: and I don't know when the next one is. He's the like15800:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.019The Alliance: he sort of comes out of that Tony Robbins, Pmd. Amanda.15900:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.72030697: I think I looked at his website after we talked.16000:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.050The Alliance: Yeah.16100:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.55030697: I know who you're.16200:33:06.550 --> 00:33:32.380The Alliance: So he, yeah, he's just like the God of, like the most practical tools in the world. I don't think he's playing to me on the wall. I don't think he's playing at the classiest level, but I never like I don't care with those dudes like I like him. I think his heart's in the right place, and I like him, and like I can repurpose his tools in my way. So he's an interesting dude and if you16300:33:32.430 --> 00:33:57.059The Alliance: sort of like I can facilitate that a little bit. I tell you to get your sub stack numbers a little higher, so I can like I wanna be able to catch his attention. But like, even if like, even if we set a target and say, Okay, let's wait till I got like my 1,000 or whatever, and then I'll right. But what you, whenever you're ready, I'm happy to like. I'll text him, and I'll be like, Hey, I want you to meet my friend Wit, who's doing this really interesting sub stack?16400:33:57.311 --> 00:34:06.130The Alliance: And I think you guys would have a great conversation, and I'll just do it that way. He'll get on the phone with you and talk to you. But I want you to have.16500:34:06.710 --> 00:34:13.585The Alliance: I want you to bring. I want him to feel like it's a value exchange a little bit rather than other. Otherwise it gets a little weird.16600:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.62030697: There are.16700:34:18.090 --> 00:34:41.479The Alliance: there are as you build. So as you as you build up a little, there's a bunch of introductions I can make that are sort of really next year that can help propel you to like people who are gonna want to bring you into things they're doing. You know what I mean, even if I go to Peter Diamandis and go. Hey, this is my buddy with. He's gotten really good. But you gotta be a couple of years in. So I can help you at that.16800:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.689The Alliance: Amazing, that's awesome.16900:34:43.125 --> 00:34:44.829The Alliance: What I would do17000:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.249The Alliance: the way I mean the way I would, the way I would think about this is.17100:34:49.479 --> 00:34:54.149The Alliance: I would find every AI leader who currently has kids right now.17200:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.63030697: Yeah.17300:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.287The Alliance: And I would find17400:34:57.569 --> 00:35:05.739The Alliance: all the like. And I just I just target the parent groups and the and the AI leaders. And I would look at groups where like.17500:35:06.329 --> 00:35:07.349The Alliance: so17600:35:07.719 --> 00:35:18.349The Alliance: where there are big newsletters like Ypo eo, like these, these groups have kids. Now, this is their issues. They're starting to deal with churches17700:35:19.259 --> 00:35:22.579The Alliance: might be a really interesting and synagogue might be really.17800:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.74030697: What was the one you said before? What was the one we you said before synagogue in churches.17900:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.440The Alliance: Churches. Yeah, sure, right? Synagogues. Like, those are remarkably18000:35:33.590 --> 00:35:54.189The Alliance: so. It's hard to get into schools because they're gated. But like you could go to a synagogue. Talk to the Rabbi, and say, I'd like to, you know I'd like to offer this to your congregation. I'm trying to have the conversation with as many parents as I can. Blah blah! You could like. You know what I mean? That's a that's a fast way.18100:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.64030697: My neighbor. Actually, it was an that's a great idea.18200:35:56.640 --> 00:36:25.129The Alliance: Yeah, so. But the thing you gotta remember the thing you gotta use. You gotta go, Neil Strauss, on this. Neil's the 1st guy I ever saw that do this from stage. It's a shitty tactic, but you're gonna do a sub stack. He would get on stage. He'd be like, if you text me right now. Flash a number. I'll send you this immediate Pdf, that's solving your child problems right? You want. If you go to my sub stack. Right now, I'll give you this bonus guide to how to talk to your kids about AI,18300:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.610The Alliance: yeah.18400:36:25.610 --> 00:36:51.450The Alliance: like, basically, I, I think what you need to do is keep going until you have enough to say to put together a little free giveaway, right? Like, Hey, subscribe to my newsletter. Get this thing right. Yeah, get my 20 interviews with principals, or like whatever it is right, like that sort of that sort of stuff. And you can remember that you can use interviews.18500:36:51.450 --> 00:36:51.93030697: Yeah.18600:36:51.930 --> 00:37:02.269The Alliance: So I knew I wanted to play in science. I knew I wanted to contribute to flow size at the highest level, so I befriended the scientists I interviewed.18700:37:02.540 --> 00:37:25.880The Alliance: Yeah. And then I kept calling them up every couple of months to put them back into other stories and ask them new questions, and over like 5 years. They started to realize that I knew what I was talking about, and they started to trust me. I went really slowly, because they didn't have a sub stack. You know what I mean. I didn't have any of this stuff, but you can do all those same things. You can use conversations as a way to get18800:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.500The Alliance: into networks and networks as a way to get audiences.18900:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.29630697: That's great.19000:37:33.680 --> 00:37:40.48030697: You've watched me through this like. What am I missing from your program like? Where am I? Where am I not going in the way that I need to.19100:37:43.300 --> 00:37:48.120The Alliance: I literally don't see you missing anything.19200:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.83030697: Okay.19300:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.210The Alliance: Like.19400:37:51.220 --> 00:38:00.179The Alliance: The thing about this stuff that is the hardest thing to do is be steady with it19500:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.500The Alliance: sort of forever like. That's where that like19600:38:03.700 --> 00:38:10.529The Alliance: peak performance is 7 to 10 things to do every week. Like, are you doubling down, you getting your primary flow? Activity in19700:38:10.670 --> 00:38:17.280The Alliance: like it sounds like you went you. You've done some stuff in mountain biking and things like it sounds like you get. You're doing that.19800:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.89030697: Each morning, too, and yep.19900:38:19.520 --> 00:38:26.310The Alliance: Sounds like you're your relation. You're tending your relationships and having your conversations, distraction management. You're on top of.20000:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.87030697: Yep.20100:38:29.585 --> 00:38:37.100The Alliance: Yeah. I like to me, to me it's steadfastedness. And to me, like I think I would think hard about20200:38:38.240 --> 00:38:45.159The Alliance: the shit list the feedback list like I would lean into that, because usually what happens?20300:38:45.510 --> 00:39:12.490The Alliance: Momentum is always followed by plateau right? Like it goes up. It's got a plateau, and life is going to start punching you in the mouth because life punches people in the mouth. Yeah, the the secret is, how do you ingrain the habit and get enough wins that. But when the time life starts punching you, you're not losing momentum because it's not like you fight like when life punches me in the mouth. The 1st thing I want to do is write my book.20400:39:12.865 --> 00:39:23.229The Alliance: That's what I that's how I fight back. I fight back by doing my work. So like there's no like the harder I get hit the more work gets done.20500:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.600The Alliance: Yeah, I mean.20600:39:24.600 --> 00:39:35.93930697: The thing I'm most excited about right now is the time in the morning where I feel like I can write and explore some of this stuff, and that's like that's been a really nice new space for me.20700:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.949The Alliance: And yeah, like, it's just energizing right now. But yeah, to your point.20800:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.360The Alliance: I.20900:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.81030697: I love you.21000:39:40.810 --> 00:40:10.089The Alliance: I like everything that you're doing. And it seems like you're you're doing all the good mindset bias framework. You know what I mean. Yeah. And really, your growth mindset is full blast. And like, Yeah, man, I like with you. You're like, you're you. You're. I think you're doing everything right like you're doing everything I asked. And you're getting the exact results, I thought, and other than me saying, Hey! Strategically, I would think about these directions, I think, just keep going right. The I mean21100:40:10.510 --> 00:40:18.479The Alliance: the danger is losing momentum and not having a plan to do well for what to do when you start losing them right.21200:40:18.700 --> 00:40:29.43930697: Yeah, no, that's a good. That's a good call out. And I very much appreciate the marketing guidance, the hard targets, the stuff that you've done playing in this kind of space, because that's just it's just good21300:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.96930697: focus, like, I just like to have those kind of directional focus things to do.21400:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.420The Alliance: Alright. I gotta jump, cause I gotta see for sure21500:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.570The Alliance: 15Êmin for Annie. And this is gonna be great. This is fantastic.21600:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.180The Alliance: Yeah, thanks.21700:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.409The Alliance: You're playing so hard.21800:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.44030697: Absolutely bye.
