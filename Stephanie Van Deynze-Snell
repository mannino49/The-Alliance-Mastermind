🎯 Insight 1: Mission Clarity + Vector Focus
Data Signals:
Stephanie is deeply mission-driven: “flow for vets”, “flow for leaders”, “healthy vet teams” — all with the purpose of reducing burnout, enhancing wellbeing, and scaling impact through leadership.

She is at an ideation stage, considering whether to focus on the vet world (where she has credibility) or broader leadership.

Analytics Insight:
✅ Clear MTP centered on well-being, flow, and organizational health.
❗ Risk: Vector diffusion — multiple simultaneous ambitions without sequential prioritization could slow traction.

Suggested Metric:
➡ Mission Alignment Score: % of time spent on activities directly advancing the most strategic, near-term MTP.
(Estimate: ~50% — good mission clarity, but diffusion across too many initiatives)

🎯 Insight 2: Flow Readiness & Structural Discipline
Data Signals:
Strong personal practices: clear goals, daily planning, distraction management, recovery activities (e.g., walking, sauna, meditation).

Admitted challenges: inconsistent sleep due to external factors (kids, long daylight), occasional derailment from schedule disruptions (e.g., holidays).

Analytics Insight:
✅ Stephanie’s habits show solid foundational flow practices.
❗ Barrier: Inconsistent schedule adherence + sleep impact → lowers cognitive readiness for deep work and flow triggers.

Suggested Metric:
➡ Flow Readiness Index: Composite of clear goals, distraction management, recovery, sleep.
(Estimate: ~60% — good base, disrupted by external factors)

🎯 Insight 3: Flow Leadership Leverage + Thought Leadership Trajectory
Data Signals:
Wants to move from vet practice owner to flow thought leader, exploring research-backed models for burnout prevention.

Desires credibility through studies, publications, and rigorous validation before scaling programs.

Open to partnerships, e.g., with Flow Research Collective, vet organizations, Bruce’s clinics.

Analytics Insight:
✅ High leadership leverage potential, especially in vet sector where she has domain expertise.
❗ Needs to sequence: build vet credibility + pilot studies → then expand to wider leadership.

Suggested Metric:
➡ Flow Leadership Leverage Score: Readiness to influence orgs + audiences through credible flow models.
(Estimate: ~55% — great vision, execution phase starting)
