WEBVTT100:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.370Amity Cooper: Hey!200:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.700The Alliance: How are you?300:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.160Amity Cooper: I'm good. How you doing.400:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.809The Alliance: And excellent insanely insanely busy, but excellent.500:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.620Amity Cooper: Good.600:05:27.520 --> 00:05:37.460The Alliance: Alright. I wanna jump in because we we time is tight, and it's your time. And so I wanna start where I've been starting, which is. And you know this about me. So700:05:37.770 --> 00:05:52.930The Alliance: you know that I like to fire hose data at people. And you also know that I always think when you're reading a book, the thing to pay attention to the most are the emotional. Wow. So like Whoa, I just got punched in the face by. So as a place to start, I want to800:05:53.720 --> 00:06:13.110The Alliance: focus on on big questions that I can answer for you, and I know I asked you to bring those. But before we do that, what punched you in the face like, what's what's stuck with you, and what what are you like? Oh, shit this. I want to apply this, I need to know, like what what is, what is, what is immediately resonating with you. Often a great place to start.900:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.109Amity Cooper: I think that when Covid happened1000:06:23.870 --> 00:06:43.840Amity Cooper: and I had just come out of grad school, maybe 2 years before, and I had had all this year all this time in business, and when I started my practice and Covid struck, I was like1100:06:43.900 --> 00:06:57.310Amity Cooper: floored by the fact that most of my peers and colleagues were just. They didn't know how to do it. They didn't know how to go from knee to knee to screen to screen, and that sense of1200:06:58.250 --> 00:07:20.040Amity Cooper: disempowerment like they didn't have control over themselves, or their future, or their business, or even their life. You know it. Just it floored me, and so I sort of did a deep dive into. Why, this is what approaching this from curiosity. And I think that led me to this point where1300:07:20.350 --> 00:07:31.749Amity Cooper: I'm a researcher like, I go down a lot of rabbit holes trying to figure out and make sense of things. And I started seeing all of these sort of1400:07:32.400 --> 00:07:49.160Amity Cooper: contradictory information about, like, I knew what exponential technology was going to do, and I also saw what nature healing could do. And so I was bringing those 2 things together. And so what gets me? What hits me in the face?1500:07:51.770 --> 00:07:59.479Amity Cooper: that there's ways to solve the crisis at hand, and it's a Clusterfuck, and1600:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.360Amity Cooper: that bothers me. I feel like a real sense of injustice that this is going on, and1700:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.650Amity Cooper: I want to solve the problem.1800:08:10.270 --> 00:08:18.530The Alliance: So. In other words, you've got a very clear and well fueled, massively transformative purpose.1900:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.580Amity Cooper: Yes, pretty much.2000:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.289The Alliance: Right, I mean, that's what that is right. And I and and and2100:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.049The Alliance: and I'm the fucking king of you. Fools are doing it wrong2200:08:29.430 --> 00:08:56.179The Alliance: like, do it this way, like, what like did you do the homework like? What? Right? Like, I'm totally with you, like, I'm very much everything I've actually started has essentially been, it's not just, do I want to solve this problem because I'm a Reese. I'm a geek. So if I just want to solve the problem. Write a paper or a book, and I'm done like I'm good, right. If I have to solve it in the world, it's only because somebody else fucked it up2300:08:57.290 --> 00:09:14.769The Alliance: like I. My business is almost a reaction against 7 habits, 7 highly effective managers in all honesty, like the Flow Research collective. It was like, Are you fucking, kidding me? Mormon marketing gospel has become, how we should run our businesses like what.2400:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.270Amity Cooper: Yeah, yeah.2500:09:16.270 --> 00:09:24.439The Alliance: So I'm with you. Okay? So you've got the grounds for massively untransformable purpose. But you had that ahead of time unless it just punched you in the face at the event.2600:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.340Amity Cooper: Oh, no! Oh, God, no! I've been working on this for 5 years.2700:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.439The Alliance: Okay, this is my point. So what's punched at the face of the event about how to take that into the world?2800:09:37.240 --> 00:09:44.779Amity Cooper: I think it was before the event. Actually I think when I sat down in flow for writers with you.2900:09:47.820 --> 00:10:04.309Amity Cooper: one. I was surrounded. Well, I mean, we've talked about this a lot. You talk about this a lot, too. It's just like the isolation of being sitting with your thoughts is sort of maddening, and I was seeing all of these connections. I was putting the pieces together, and3000:10:04.450 --> 00:10:21.707Amity Cooper: to be in a room, and feeling that energy and that pulse of other creatives sort of like moving through it and pushing through and teasing apart whatever their their passion was like that was really inspiring. And then3100:10:22.470 --> 00:10:36.820Amity Cooper: And then that book. So I've been working on this book called Healing Entrepreneurship, for probably since flow for writers. And it is the amalgamation of3200:10:37.100 --> 00:10:56.699Amity Cooper: everything that I have learned that I've put together that I talk about in all of my podcast interviews, that I'm just obsessed. And it's about this merging, this convergence of how new technology is going to disrupt. And already is the mental health industry. And it's changing the way we do business.3300:10:56.740 --> 00:11:08.370Amity Cooper: and and healers are in this incredible advantage. We have an unfair advantage to serve at scale and wide, and3400:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.979Amity Cooper: and we just don't know how to do that. And so I feel really empowered to talk about that and to3500:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.729Amity Cooper: change the dance on that. So.3600:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.529The Alliance: Okay, I'm trying to go from this3700:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.830The Alliance: to action steps in the world.3800:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.859The Alliance: What? Like I like, I'm I'm clear on this.3900:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.610The Alliance: I'm clear that you have 80 acres.4000:11:30.850 --> 00:11:31.340Amity Cooper: What?4100:11:31.340 --> 00:11:38.369The Alliance: And desire to do something that way. I'm clicking clear on like the the facts on the ground and the gusto. What I4200:11:38.580 --> 00:11:44.790The Alliance: we're trying to start to tease apart, which I think is part of what we have to do together is like4300:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.840The Alliance: so.4400:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.280Amity Cooper: It's.4500:11:47.280 --> 00:11:56.472The Alliance: Peter, Peter and I do this differently. Peter's is friendlier than mine, but I think mine is better for anal retentive people like us. But4600:11:57.520 --> 00:12:06.909The Alliance: Peter's version is, Hey, you've got an Mtp. It's really fucking clear, right mental health at scale.4700:12:07.080 --> 00:12:13.489The Alliance: And you've actually got a high, a high, hard goal under that. Which is this book? Right? Like those 2 things are clear in a sense.4800:12:14.880 --> 00:12:38.549The Alliance: But Peter would say, Okay, your figure, say your mental, your high heart goal is probably gonna take 10 years. It'd probably take more. But let's just say 10 years for the fun of it. And you know, with all this stuff, growth is exponential. So where are you going to be in 5 years? The question, knowing that, of course, that, like you're not going to be halfway. That's not 5 years. It's gonna look like, Oh, my God, I'm 10% of the way because it starts to get exponential.4900:12:38.550 --> 00:12:46.990The Alliance: And if you can get to 5 years. Can you get to 2 and a half, and then you start going month by month and day by day. That is Peter's way of doing it. It's chronological.5000:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.840The Alliance: it is effective.5100:12:48.990 --> 00:12:56.170The Alliance: I personally like to start by saying, what are the 100 things I need to do to accomplish this Mtp.5200:12:56.410 --> 00:13:04.910Amity Cooper: Yeah. So I figured it out. I figured it out. And I I actually sent you a brief this morning because I I been.5300:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.840The Alliance: Did you really.5400:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.909Amity Cooper: Yeah, I really do.5500:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.060The Alliance: Get a brief.5600:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.270Amity Cooper: I don't know. Maybe you did. I don't.5700:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.989The Alliance: Not get a brief. How did you? What did you email it to me?5800:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.210Amity Cooper: I think you said it to sk and.5900:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.599The Alliance: Flow alliance.com.6000:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.189Amity Cooper: I think so.6100:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.069The Alliance: Dot co.6200:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.119Amity Cooper: Dot com.6300:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.480The Alliance: Co. Did you send it to.com? I did not get it, which is a little weird.6400:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.249The Alliance: Yeah, I definitely didn't get it.6500:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.560Amity Cooper: Okay.6600:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.689The Alliance: And and I've got emails from you in this.6700:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.780Amity Cooper: So here's here's the plan.6800:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.949The Alliance: Oh, I'm so excited you got to a plan already.6900:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.489The Alliance: This is what I was7000:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.619The Alliance: trying to get out of you. All right. Cool. Well done, all right. Let's hear it.7100:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.470Amity Cooper: Alright. So yes, I needed to kind.7200:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.930The Alliance: Is that, by the way, is this what you want to do with your with our hour? Run through this plan? Okay, just wanna make sure.7300:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.090Amity Cooper: Is that cool like.7400:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.409The Alliance: Yeah, no, I like, I, literally.7500:13:56.410 --> 00:13:56.940Amity Cooper: Hard.7600:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.868The Alliance: I am literally here to advance your cause.7700:14:03.680 --> 00:14:12.379The Alliance: it's I'm happy to pick it apart. I've I haven't. So I appreciate that because I like one of the things that I have to actually ask everybody to borrow we're together is.7800:14:12.480 --> 00:14:24.839The Alliance: do you guys want me to blow holes in your business ideas, but it's really good at it. And some people don't, and some people do be. It depends on how you deal with motivation and information.7900:14:25.320 --> 00:14:35.240Amity Cooper: Right. No, I think because I've been sitting with this and and working on this for so long, I I need. I need. I need feedback.8000:14:35.240 --> 00:14:42.169The Alliance: Okay, let me, can I ask one question before you go into it? Because it's the one, is it a VR based system is that we're we're still thinking. VR.8100:14:42.170 --> 00:14:48.910Amity Cooper: It's actually a e-learning platform called Theraverse, and where you train up8200:14:49.200 --> 00:14:57.360Amity Cooper: the mental health workforce to incorporate all of the new technologies into their practices. The problem is.8300:14:57.810 --> 00:15:07.629Amity Cooper: the problem is that everybody is talking about and so wrapped up into the AI story here that8400:15:07.670 --> 00:15:37.500Amity Cooper: everybody else is being left behind to become the technician, to utilize all of the technology. There isn't any training platform in existence that actually walks you through like this is a VR headset. This is the portal. This is how you log in. Here's, you know, multiple interventions training the clinician. There's lots of people that are out there, and there's companies out there that are8500:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.950Amity Cooper: basically the serving the end user. But nobody's doing this for the workforce.8600:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.170The Alliance: 2, 3 questions just off the top of my head. One.8700:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.910The Alliance: Why, I I see the therapy expertise.8800:15:58.200 --> 00:16:06.928The Alliance: Talk to you about your tool expertise your tool expertise as good as your therapy expertise. Okay? Then, I don't have to worry about that as much. The next question is,8900:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.569The Alliance: The the 1st thing I think about when you tell me this is.9000:16:12.750 --> 00:16:20.080The Alliance: I think, about my best friend, who's my editor, who got really interested in progress and robots like9100:16:20.270 --> 00:16:46.640The Alliance: 5 years ago, and he thought about becoming like the Hub for Robot Progress information online, or he's a he's. He's a black dude, and he was like, my people don't know about robots. I gotta bring robots to my people so like that was sort of what what Michael wanted to do. In a sense, right? It was tied to some other stuff, and we we really banged on the idea for a while, and what he came to was holy fuck.9200:16:46.840 --> 00:17:05.282The Alliance: Yes, I love the service component of this, but the job is actually a tech reporter. You end up being a tech reporter who's chasing robot stories all day long, so you can keep your shit on the cutting edge. So my 1st question to you is if the tech is accelerating exponentially.9300:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.090The Alliance: if you're building a plat training platform, what is the protocol? How do you keep up?9400:17:11.400 --> 00:17:29.170The Alliance: Do you hire teams for that. Well, like, what like, how does the how does it evolve? I see what gets you to launch? And I think, okay, that's a cool program. This is more of a marketing problem, because designing that program like at at least at a what would it take to get into the world level9500:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.985The Alliance: is9600:17:31.660 --> 00:17:43.080The Alliance: it's a bunch of Powerpoints, right? And a and a and a good video guy who I like. I know you know what I mean, like they're like, I I know what I know, what I've done that I know what that looks like. The next challenge is9700:17:45.130 --> 00:18:03.060The Alliance: one. If it's an all digital product. You're capped at $2,500. Otherwise you have to hire sales teams, and once you hire sales teams and start like, then it's then it's a monster that you and I'm not saying bad. I'm saying, are you sure this matches your lifestyle and your flow? That's what I'm trying to poke at here.9800:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.150The Alliance: Yeah, is the business.9900:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.290The Alliance: Is your building right for you? Is my 1st question.10000:18:07.290 --> 00:18:22.170Amity Cooper: Yeah, so this is sort of no, no, I got my, I got my start. I I've been a marketer and product developer for years, and I came into markets where I had no business being in markets, and I sort of did.10100:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.010The Alliance: Then, yeah, we're good. Okay, I it's like.10200:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.559The Alliance: Yeah, no, I'm just. I mean, I'm just like.10300:18:27.909 --> 00:18:28.259Amity Cooper: Now.10400:18:28.260 --> 00:18:34.999The Alliance: My, it's like. But but my problem is, it's like people come into flow for writers, and they want to write a bestseller book.10500:18:35.265 --> 00:18:58.610The Alliance: And I'm like, Okay, you've got your style. You've worked really hard. You've got your research, that's great. But like honest to God, if you want a true bestseller. You either have to have millions of dollars to throw at it and get lucky. Or you have to have an email list that's well into the hundreds of thousands. So that's the like. That's what I like. My next step is okay. This is all great. And you market this. Can you sell? It sounds like you can.10600:18:59.700 --> 00:19:08.680Amity Cooper: It. Can I? Again your to your question like, Do I want to? Yes, yes, because10700:19:09.290 --> 00:19:27.379Amity Cooper: I'm the girl to do it like no one else is doing it. There is a strong appeal like 1st to market. There is, there is some sexiness to that, but it also serves a greater purpose for me, because at the same time that I feel like I can create10800:19:27.510 --> 00:19:35.179Amity Cooper: any learning platform, and I can get ceus. And people like I can make a shit load of money doing that.10900:19:35.750 --> 00:19:48.640Amity Cooper: Which would be fantastic. The other piece of the puzzle is that I have. I need to bring all of my alternative therapy and my approach to life.11000:19:48.790 --> 00:20:00.289Amity Cooper: to life, and that is through accessing nature and being in touch with horses and and all of the touchy-feely woo woo stuff that I'm really good at. And11100:20:00.470 --> 00:20:24.770Amity Cooper: I saw that there's like 2. There's 2 tranches in this. There's the theraverse, which is the training platform. And then there's the actual film production and actually making immersive creative training videos that bring nature to the masses and bring that healing place to the masses. And that is another11200:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.000Amity Cooper: distribution.11300:20:26.360 --> 00:20:45.000The Alliance: Let me pause. You let me. Yeah, let me pause you here because my brain and I just want I know you've done this. I just my brain immediately goes to oh, cool like next steps. What are the order like? These are our challenges, and my brain goes. It strikes me that, especially if you've been11400:20:45.030 --> 00:20:57.390The Alliance: on podcasts, we're talking about this stuff. Blah, blah, get your fuck, get get your minimal, viable product into the market like, write write the power like, Get that done like that's.11500:20:57.800 --> 00:21:04.140The Alliance: you know, 50 to a hundred $1,000 to get to a product at a really11600:21:04.530 --> 00:21:19.428The Alliance: beautiful one with top people right? You could get there a lot quicker and a lot cheaper if you want to, and you can. School is a hundred dollars a month. If you want to go that route kind of thing. I would caution you against developing an app. I really would.11700:21:19.860 --> 00:21:30.769The Alliance: there's just too many better platforms for it. But I would say that strikes me as step one when it gets to a certain threshold of humans that would probably be.11800:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.959The Alliance: I don't know11900:21:32.910 --> 00:21:40.559The Alliance: at least 50,000 kinda users kind of thing, 25,000 users, some number. That's when the book follows.12000:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.299The Alliance: because the book the book needs credit. If it's just Amity's guide to, you know, healing entrepreneurship.12100:21:48.960 --> 00:22:03.680The Alliance: Who are you? What have you done? What right all that stuff? But if you build it on the back of this platform. Right? That's the next logical step. Then the book has a a natural audience, B, and a platform for growth. That book.12200:22:04.180 --> 00:22:11.299The Alliance: as you're writing, as the book is like the book should be like, launch the thing, write the book as you're writing the book12300:22:11.490 --> 00:22:20.629The Alliance: 2 thirds of the way through and starting to think about, how do I market and blow this up, which is like a year and a half away? If you actually go the right route with a publisher and do all this stuff.12400:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.500The Alliance: That's when you start building, filming.12500:22:26.220 --> 00:22:34.539The Alliance: working hard on the VR platform. If you're not already, because what you want to do is you want to make the book sort of the overhaul of everything you've learned12600:22:34.880 --> 00:22:55.140The Alliance: doing the platform and into the new thing, like I've been studying all the technology. I've been training all the people. This is where it's going next. That's your book. I mean, that's the frame for the book right? And the book ends up being the launch for the thing, and that also. This is the other thing I was wondering about with you, which was 2 things that bother me about the VR. Idea. One12700:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.459The Alliance: man I'm President. I know Jared Lanier. I've been in VR since. There was like it was literally the birth of VR.12800:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.870Amity Cooper: No.12900:23:03.870 --> 00:23:15.103The Alliance: Kathy actor. I was Kathy Acker's intern, and she was Jared Lanier's girlfriend like this, back in the early 19 nineties a late eighties and13000:23:16.870 --> 00:23:28.469The Alliance: I have been a VR fanatic like for a long time, and I don't like I keep saying this to people when they talk about AI. I'm like, where's the metaverse bitch13100:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.980The Alliance: like.13200:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.059The Alliance: where is it? Does it? Do you know anybody who's there? Have you already knows who's busy right like.13300:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.970Amity Cooper: That is like that doesn't work. Yeah.13400:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.239Amity Cooper: So my.13500:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.420The Alliance: The question is, my. My 1st question is, are we certain? VR is the platform13600:23:47.168 --> 00:23:52.450The Alliance: like? And that's just an open question. I just haven't seen it. I'd be really hesitant to build a13700:23:52.540 --> 00:24:18.249The Alliance: business for therapists who is a general rule, are tech phobic and busy on a platform that has not yet proven itself out, despite what we know about it, as in in terms of the therapeutic. It's a great therapeutic tool we know this. Get Brizzo proved it like, you know what I mean like? That's not the question. The question is like getting people like are like is, I don't want you to13800:24:18.370 --> 00:24:24.869The Alliance: put everything on. Tell people this when they're like, Oh, I got to start a podcast I'm like, No, you don't bill. Rogan sold13900:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.310The Alliance: this thing spotify like, yeah, yeah. So14000:24:27.310 --> 00:24:50.420The Alliance: like, if it's tipped, we're over, it's jump the shark. Something's coming next. It just hasn't happened yet, because Tiktok's too stupid, right? Like it. We're we're just not at next. But it's not like starting a podcast is insane. You're competing with like Tim Ferris, and like people have been doing it for 10 years, and they're awesome. And they've got 1 billion dollar machines and shut up. You can't compete. I don't care how much14100:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.360The Alliance: of a revelation your mushroom experience was.14200:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.670Amity Cooper: You too.14300:24:55.670 --> 00:25:01.300The Alliance: You. You know this person. I know you know this person. I know you know this person. Okay.14400:25:01.300 --> 00:25:01.630Amity Cooper: Pleasure.14500:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.699The Alliance: Besides the point.14600:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.220Amity Cooper: It's.14700:25:03.220 --> 00:25:11.580The Alliance: You get so one. My question is, is VR the right platform? Are we sure? And that may be an evolving answer. This is why I'm saying, Hey.14800:25:11.930 --> 00:25:32.420The Alliance: do your do your thing first.st Get on the cutting edge of technology or get people to be on the cutting edge technology for you, so you can keep your stuff updated. That will inform the question, of what platform am I building this thing for, and give you time while you're writing your book. I think it's like it's there's a lot of time built. There's probably more time built in there than you14900:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.590The Alliance: want to take. But15000:25:35.060 --> 00:25:43.100The Alliance: you could, you know you can compress it as you as you need, and that's how I would look at it. And because I love like.15100:25:45.230 --> 00:25:57.989The Alliance: Your idea of using. You know, big nature like I don't even think it's woo woo. I think, after what's his name's Kelcher's awe. Book. I mean we you know Scott Barry Copper, who you were going to meet later on, was15200:25:58.230 --> 00:26:04.590The Alliance: doing all work 20 years ago. I was poking. You know what I mean? A lot of people poked at it, and it's sort of15300:26:05.000 --> 00:26:16.280The Alliance: it's locked on the map what nobody's proven yet. But I know we're gonna actually proven. We're gonna prove it in VR, and this is gonna really help you. Is that all is very clearly the front end of a flow. State15400:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.240The Alliance: bombs15500:26:17.370 --> 00:26:28.489The Alliance: right? It's very clear the front end of flow state. And if you know what you're doing with all, you can easily turn it into a flow state that's really clear what exactly like it just hasn't been proven yet. That's it's sort of like15600:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.800The Alliance: there's a handful of articles that are coming off the intuition thing that15700:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.300The Alliance: you know, to poke at over the next couple of years with all being one of them.15800:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.909Amity Cooper: I I see where you're going with that and15900:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.160Amity Cooper: The research that I've had, that I've done16000:26:45.630 --> 00:26:53.500Amity Cooper: over the last. Looking back over the last 30 years of animal assisted or interactions with animals.16100:26:54.366 --> 00:26:57.429Amity Cooper: The awe is built in. It's just built in and.16200:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.469The Alliance: Yeah, my, I mean, my problem is, are we gonna is it gonna work?16300:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.140Amity Cooper: There's ways to.16400:27:01.140 --> 00:27:21.419The Alliance: Media. Is it gonna work mediated via VR, is one question and the other question I had for you. And this is built into the system is so much of that interaction is based on the like, the herd instinct of the animals. So you actually have to program herd instinct into your them right?16500:27:21.920 --> 00:27:31.740Amity Cooper: Well, I think it's actually it's it's more about the the connection. It's the relationship. It's the union that you have with the animal up close16600:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.350Amity Cooper: that I mean oxytocin.16700:27:34.350 --> 00:27:42.989The Alliance: But is it? I mean isn't like what I was really. What I've read at the at A really foundational level is what what people realize at the gateway. Maybe I'm wrong. Was that16800:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.420The Alliance: bird animals react very poorly to norepinephrine.16900:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.350Amity Cooper: Hmm.17000:27:48.350 --> 00:28:07.540The Alliance: I don't know if they and it's because if one animal is upset it probably means there's a predator somewhere, because herd animals are wired that way right? So norepinephrine, which shows up in pupil dilation, among other like very subtle signals that are really easily read by a herd fast17100:28:07.710 --> 00:28:21.699The Alliance: that so like when people come in and they're really Adhd and sped up, and everything else. The courses read Norepinephrine, and there's you can't actually write the word. They'll they'll pull away from you. That's when they walk away. It's when they're reading Norepinephrine17200:28:22.900 --> 00:28:29.480The Alliance: Which the reason I'm mentioning all this is there's17300:28:29.600 --> 00:28:49.660The Alliance: really cool inroads on how to do this all through VR heads like there's stuff to start doing this. We played with it for a long time, because I wanted to use. I've been wanting to use headsets and cameras to measure flow through facial signals. And one of them is right. So we've been looking at these same things. So there, there's like, there's a17400:28:50.130 --> 00:29:04.535The Alliance: there's a program programming challenge is the wrong word. I don't think it's challenge. There's just a framework. There's a series of frameworks that I'd wanna start putting around the experience before we even just before you even decide on the technology. Yet.17500:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.789Amity Cooper: Okay, interesting. Okay.17600:29:06.790 --> 00:29:17.189The Alliance: Cause. I, yeah, I mean, I I start asking from a functional level like, if I start breaking that one out, I'd be like, well, functionally, neurobiologically. What am I actually trying to deliver?17700:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.880The Alliance: Because a lot of this stuff has been hacked.17800:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.109The Alliance: Probably not assembled in the way that you're going to assemble. It.17900:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.640Amity Cooper: I'm taking it in what you're saying to me. Yeah.18000:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.590Amity Cooper: I have a very high level view.18100:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.380Amity Cooper: a bird's eye view of this and I.18200:29:42.810 --> 00:29:49.819Amity Cooper: And these are the details that I need help with. I need clarity on them. I need somebody to explain them to me.18300:29:50.020 --> 00:29:57.249Amity Cooper: I I can see z really clearly like I know what that looks like. I know.18400:29:58.025 --> 00:30:00.754Amity Cooper: I know how this solves.18500:30:01.580 --> 00:30:17.350The Alliance: No, I. So here's here's so this is your. So this gets us to our first, st like. My goal. Here is, by the way, to distill this into like load over those at 3. So I want to give you 2 to 3 things to think about and work on this month.18600:30:18.175 --> 00:30:37.677The Alliance: Until our next like. That's the that's my whole goal. Here is like Sarah you'll meet if you come tomorrow. Who? Who's my dear friend? Who I listen to whenever she's in times of crisis. If you can see 3 steps ahead, you're winning like. So all I'm saying is, let's just like what are. The next 3 steps is is sort of like that's a big win.18700:30:37.980 --> 00:30:59.750The Alliance: and it strikes me that your steps are very like I. So one I. When I am seeking clarity, I always start my strengths and you've listed them. You actually know a lot about therapy, you know a lot about marketing, you know. So you know a lot of blah blah. So we know if you agree with my order right? If the order is18800:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.340The Alliance: class book18900:31:02.670 --> 00:31:12.000The Alliance: VR platform like, if that's let's just say, that's the next order. Okay, so from 0 to class.19000:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.849The Alliance: what are the19100:31:15.080 --> 00:31:35.570The Alliance: start with, what are the 10 things that have to happen, or 20 things that have to happen. And you know a lot of these things right? You've done product development you've poked in. So all I'm saying is, start listing out the dull stuff, and what will happen is you'll make 10, and you'll be like, oh, that's not. No, no. I missed a step in the marketing that's actually like 3 steps, and you'll put those things in.19200:31:35.620 --> 00:32:04.250The Alliance: And what will end up happening is you'll end up with a much clearer checklist of all this stuff you know how to do right. This is how we get from 0 to course in the market, and the good news is you now have this group of badasses, myself included, who can take your list after you got everything there and say, What am I missing? Chatgpt is also good for this. What am I missing here to get to there? Right? Then you. Then we start time coding some of it, because things will happen in different sequences.19300:32:04.330 --> 00:32:13.370The Alliance: And the most important thing as you're doing this is the there you're getting to this, this, this training 1st level training.19400:32:15.160 --> 00:32:36.980The Alliance: Does it fit your life? Does it fit your marriage? Does it fit your mom and your kid? And the way you want to be happy and all like? Make sure it fits, because otherwise too much of a pain. In the ass especially level one right level one. You want something that just fits level 2, you can start to say, Okay.19500:32:37.090 --> 00:33:05.330The Alliance: Beta, test done. These are the change I gotta make. This is how I gotta make that fit in my life kind of thing. And it's like it's iterative. But people often design things for their dreams that don't actually fit their lives because they suddenly think they're gonna change into different people just because they're chasing their dreams, and we don't like we're still stuck with ourselves. Right? So make sure it make sure. I I did this with somebody yesterday somebody else in the Alliance I was like. This is awesome.19600:33:05.330 --> 00:33:21.480The Alliance: But make sure, like what your definition fits, who you are, what your strengths are where you want to go. The person you want to become, how you want to live your life. Going forward don't like the cause. The worst thing. You probably know this already, but the worst thing19700:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.250The Alliance: for is to build a prison out of your own dreams.19800:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.340Amity Cooper: Yeah, yeah.19900:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.809The Alliance: Does that make sense.20000:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.220Amity Cooper: It makes a lot of sense in Alabama.20100:33:34.220 --> 00:33:45.859The Alliance: And I. What what I'd like you to try to do is do it for all 3 stages. Right. You've got a 3 stage fraud. You've got 3 stages we've got right. The stages are glass.20200:33:46.330 --> 00:33:51.150The Alliance: Well, it's really 4 stages. Let's say class company book.20300:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.960The Alliance: VR.20400:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.690The Alliance: Am I wrong?20500:33:56.740 --> 00:34:03.610The Alliance: Because the class will get you to launch, but you need to build it into something that is the size you want it right.20600:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.330Amity Cooper: I I actually, now that we're20700:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.520Amity Cooper: talking it out, I almost feel like20800:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.979Amity Cooper: my lowest hanging fruit right now is20900:34:15.562 --> 00:34:23.779Amity Cooper: making these nature videos. So I have an opportunity to partner with a VR immersive company called Mind Immersive.21000:34:24.060 --> 00:34:37.660Amity Cooper: and they they produce VR content for the Eldercare market. And they're in over 4,000 facilities across the country, and they're working with the Va.21100:34:37.980 --> 00:34:54.320Amity Cooper: And I met them maybe a year and a half 2 years ago, and I was like, Oh, my God! They have a working model. They they have. They have partnered with Htc. And they have a lightweight VR. Headset. That's amazing. And their content.21200:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.390Amity Cooper: Granted is for the elder market.21300:34:58.020 --> 00:35:06.790Amity Cooper: But it's really boring, and it's like puppies and goats, and like they don't have anything really beautiful.21400:35:06.950 --> 00:35:27.479Amity Cooper: And so we were spitballing the CEO and I we were talking about. Well, when you know that I got my property, I was like, Come out film. Let's just co-produce film and put this out on your platform and get it out there. And then it started me thinking about21500:35:27.480 --> 00:35:44.520Amity Cooper: oh, my God! Well, then, I can. It's not just me. I want to film other clinicians, other practitioners who are the best in the world at delivering this content, and then I can go at scale. I can go really fast because I could have a distribution channel.21600:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.340The Alliance: So you're essentially a film. So you're essentially a film production company.21700:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.030Amity Cooper: Yeah.21800:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.720The Alliance: Sorts.21900:35:50.060 --> 00:35:57.419Amity Cooper: I think that truly that might be. I have it lined up like I can just have them come out22000:35:57.610 --> 00:35:58.460Amity Cooper: and.22100:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.129The Alliance: What's the call? What's the business structure around it?22200:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.199Amity Cooper: What do you mean like in what regards.22300:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.100The Alliance: I mean, what are you paying them? Are they paying you? What's the.22400:36:09.100 --> 00:36:09.820Amity Cooper: Well, that.22500:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.530The Alliance: Percent. What's.22600:36:10.530 --> 00:36:19.540Amity Cooper: Yeah, back and forth, like they were just hoping it would be like an in trade. Like I I get, I get featured.22700:36:19.730 --> 00:36:28.359Amity Cooper: I'm doing something, and they're distributing it. And then I was like, Well, what are your licensing fees and things like that? And it sort of22800:36:28.570 --> 00:36:37.159Amity Cooper: went downhill. But I know we still stay in touch, and I figure like I can pick it back up again when I'm really clear about what I want.22900:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.600Amity Cooper: and I'm not sure what I want from that.23000:36:41.330 --> 00:36:47.612The Alliance: So those are that that is23100:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.029The Alliance: Is that like the 1st step, you get your feet wet this way and then that leads you to.23200:37:01.080 --> 00:37:09.470Amity Cooper: Like. Here I am. I'm I'm I'm producing content, usable, content, therapeutic content.23300:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.620Amity Cooper: This is how I'm doing it, and23400:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.140Amity Cooper: I can help others do that as well.23500:37:17.330 --> 00:37:24.119The Alliance: And I could have a production company, I could have a production company, and that content could be spread around and licensed to all.23600:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.219The Alliance: And who's paying for the productions.23700:37:27.670 --> 00:37:34.590Amity Cooper: The clinicians. The clinicians would pay me to do the production and film them and handle all of their distributions.23800:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.850Amity Cooper: and the licensing.23900:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.240The Alliance: Are you sure there's a market and a product market fit.24000:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.419Amity Cooper: I don't know. I don't know.24100:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.209Amity Cooper: and then but but I know that there are at least 20 VR.24200:37:51.430 --> 00:37:56.249Amity Cooper: Training companies out there that are in desperate need of new content.24300:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.500The Alliance: And so24400:38:01.218 --> 00:38:14.431The Alliance: I'm not saying no, I mean, it's it's a very different idea. But and I'm not saying no cause it like these are all these are ir goals. So you you're gonna set a bunch of them anyways. And24500:38:15.160 --> 00:38:31.109The Alliance: I think it's useful to have multiple higher goals, because that way. You don't fix it at one of them and one of the stalls. You can go someplace else with your energy, so I think that's useful. it. It just keep maintains momentum usually. So I'm not mad at. I'm not mad at the switch. I24600:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.310The Alliance: think. 3 things, I think one.24700:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.720The Alliance: Do you know, a fucking thing about film production cause. That's.24800:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.410Amity Cooper: No.24900:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.280Amity Cooper: Okay.25000:38:40.280 --> 00:38:53.739The Alliance: That's somebody else that's that's a world or produce right like that. You're you're now in a world that you've never worked in before trying to turn it into a business, so that strikes me as25100:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.180The Alliance: dangerous, or a very long term project to.25200:38:58.180 --> 00:38:58.710Amity Cooper: One.25300:38:58.710 --> 00:39:02.070The Alliance: When I hear you say all that stuff.25400:39:03.080 --> 00:39:15.199The Alliance: when I think scale and like you want to go to scale, that's what you were talking about. You want to help a lot of people. Your model like, if you actually mean that, then what you really probably want to do25500:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.029The Alliance: is hire out the film. People25600:39:19.540 --> 00:39:34.273The Alliance: raise a, you know, test it out to get a product, to show people and then try to like it's like a it's like a fund or a nonprofit, or something, where that you're given, where you have a huge war chest with which to do this with25700:39:34.820 --> 00:39:45.436The Alliance: because I don't. These. These are, gonna these are, they're very. They're gonna end up. Being a lot more expensive than anybody assumes is my guess especially done right. And25800:39:48.710 --> 00:40:02.420The Alliance: that needs a war chest to go to scale. Otherwise, like I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't trust your market. I don't think you have product market fit. I don't think you're gonna be able to go like the 1st thing I would do, if that's the real plan is, I would25900:40:02.970 --> 00:40:13.915The Alliance: try to find a way to talk to a bunch of other people doing the kind of work that you're interested in. Say, is this something you would even want? You know what I mean. I would just go ask potential customers,26000:40:15.330 --> 00:40:15.984The Alliance: and26100:40:17.100 --> 00:40:38.790The Alliance: I mean, that's what you know. This is how we got the alliance. Also. Right? We got a whole bunch of people like you on the phone. I mean, I knew what I wanted to do. But what was the framework. What was all that stuff I had to hear from you guys also? Cause it really shifted what I ended up doing. And it's gonna end up, shifting it more. I think.26200:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.720Amity Cooper: After talking to everyone.26300:40:41.720 --> 00:40:47.780The Alliance: Well, after talking to, I'm half 2 thirds of the way through all the interviews. I'll talk about this with Sarah tomorrow, but26400:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.900The Alliance: most people26500:40:51.120 --> 00:41:16.870The Alliance: are banging into exactly what you're banging into, which are essentially goal setting problems. Right? They're how do you? Hierarchy? Big projects? And how do you scale a big project. But to me, that's a goal setting problem. From a cause like that's how I think about. I think about everything through like peak performance lenses. And I'm like, Okay, you know, I get that. These are big business challenges. But it's what I said in class, everything is a checklist.26600:41:17.860 --> 00:41:32.567The Alliance: What the checklist is because you're all badasses. You all know how to execute a checklist, and I'm going to give you the tools to make the execution slow here. Those things we know so like the real question is, what's the checklist? That's a lot. I'm actually quite good at that.26700:41:33.440 --> 00:41:50.690The Alliance: because you can't write 16 books and start 16 companies without being able to do that. Very like. I do it instinctively, because I learn I cut my teeth. Writing books and books are just nothing but hired purposes that take 3 years to 5 years. Right? So I know how to scale something like that.26800:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.139Amity Cooper: Yeah, all right. Well, saying it out loud.26900:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.740The Alliance: Yeah, but.27000:41:54.740 --> 00:42:19.499Amity Cooper: My VR thing it well, the the film piece. I think it was an opportunity that fell in my lap, and I and I see the potential of it, but maybe I should just do it for shits and giggles, and I should have. They would provide the team. They would come out they would film. They would do what they want. I could, you know I could27100:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.600Amity Cooper: have my own session.27200:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.550The Alliance: Let me ask. Let me ask you a question, though.27300:42:29.230 --> 00:42:36.969The Alliance: like I'm I am so wary of letting them shoot yours for you because they're gonna own it.27400:42:37.120 --> 00:42:43.610The Alliance: And it's gonna like you're not like, I that scares me so much out of like out. Let me give you an example.27500:42:44.070 --> 00:43:02.660The Alliance: The 1st iteration of flow for writers. The very 1st one I did for a company called Creative Live. They were like called me up, and they were like, do you want to do a little course for our creatives? And I was at this point like not even training flow much, and I was like, sure I'm happy to do it. And iteration was amazing. We did an amazing thing together.27600:43:02.860 --> 00:43:13.409The Alliance: but the distribute their distribution has withered, and the contract is terrible for me like terrible if I make a hundred dollars a year from them off this thing.27700:43:13.620 --> 00:43:27.830The Alliance: and like we make a million dollars a year off of it easy. You know what I mean like, it's it's crazy. And I'm really sad. I did it. I did another one with Mindvalley for the same reason. I was testing new material.27800:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.339Amity Cooper: That like you were on there.27900:43:30.340 --> 00:43:39.930The Alliance: It's a dope. Course I'm still on there, and they make so they make a ton of money each year from me a ton of money I make so little, and I thought I28000:43:40.110 --> 00:44:02.222The Alliance: really negotiated that one hard after my experience with creative live. This was back when I was at the Flow Genome Project and and trying to work inside my company was almost impossible, because my partner was insane. So I was trying to figure out how the fuck do I pay the bills and get myself out of this company? And I made 2 mistakes, and it was these mistakes, because they were easy, fast solutions.28100:44:02.510 --> 00:44:11.179The Alliance: they weren't. I actually like, I mean, the distribution channel that was Mindvalley is amazing, and it's gotten me a lot of customers, but28200:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.430The Alliance: probably could have28300:44:13.670 --> 00:44:24.220The Alliance: done it myself and used my, my, you know what I mean. I vision wouldn't let me on the stage. Talk about it. I could get you on vision stage. You know what I mean. Once your thing becomes real, I like like it's28400:44:24.580 --> 00:44:30.640The Alliance: I didn't know what I was doing. So I said yes to a bunch of stuff it seemed like a real big step up.28500:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.109The Alliance: but it wasn't. When I got to where I wanted to go, and it was actually a shot.28600:44:34.110 --> 00:44:39.470Amity Cooper: And I've gotten myself into situations like that in the past, and I.28700:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.449The Alliance: Well, let me ask you a question, are you? What's where are you? Cash wise?28800:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.140Amity Cooper: Oh, I need cash. I need that.28900:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.980The Alliance: So this is not something so what you want is something that can boots be bootstrapped29000:44:53.110 --> 00:44:58.520The Alliance: right? You you want something that's I.29100:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.549The Alliance: you have one or 2 choices is a place to start.29200:45:06.660 --> 00:45:14.469The Alliance: I don't, because I don't think starting with the book is gonna give you an enough leverage like you're if if you started the book you're gonna have to write.29300:45:14.680 --> 00:45:22.840The Alliance: who bought? You're gonna definitely have to write a second book in 5 years to get you where you want to go, and then probably another one, right? And maybe that's what you want to do. But.29400:45:22.840 --> 00:45:32.300Amity Cooper: You know. I just tell Heidi and I have been talking a lot about the book, and we've been going through stuff, and I sent her an outline. And29500:45:32.690 --> 00:45:44.249Amity Cooper: and now I'm I'm just trying to. I'm actually trying to use chat, gpt, and notebook to kind of pull all of this stuff together all the research together that I've had.29600:45:44.430 --> 00:45:51.069Amity Cooper: and so that I can go back and I can edit it. And she really, we we kind of came to the decision that this is more like.29700:45:51.360 --> 00:46:20.309Amity Cooper: it's such a nuanced small market that I'm targeting. It's almost like a textbook. It's like, if I could get it into like Springer, or whatever those pesi does. You know they have a publishing house like they could publish it, and it could be really like a textbook for clinicians as they're going through school. So I'm not on the same. I'm aware that this book is not29800:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.969Amity Cooper: well. It is not enough.29900:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.860The Alliance: I'd like, okay, so, but that's awesome.30000:46:27.380 --> 00:46:34.090The Alliance: That's even better, because then it's a then it's slightly. It's a different thing. Then I think, like.30100:46:35.090 --> 00:46:43.663The Alliance: I'm writing a textbook right now. A Springer textbook right now. Though, it's an edited one. So it's not like it's not that kind of thing.30200:46:44.824 --> 00:46:59.570The Alliance: and I didn't put the deal together. But I know people who put those deals together so I can, you know. Ask some questions around. I like that idea. By the way, if like, if that's where the book is heading it like, there's nothing that you want to do30300:47:00.550 --> 00:47:05.820The Alliance: that is going to be hurt by the fact that you've written the textbook on this stuff right?30400:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.360Amity Cooper: Hey? Absolutely not.30500:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.389The Alliance: And here here's here. So if I was so.30600:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.220The Alliance: if I was in your position and I30700:47:18.550 --> 00:47:25.239The Alliance: was trying to bootstrap a company, how how, how close to done is the book.30800:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.263Amity Cooper: Oh, God!30900:47:31.970 --> 00:47:32.500The Alliance: Okay.31000:47:32.500 --> 00:47:41.160The Alliance: that back. How close to being able to take what is going to be like a 350 page textbook, let's say and turn it into a31100:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.470The Alliance: 50 page. Primer.31200:47:46.090 --> 00:47:54.940The Alliance: here's what I here. So here's here's my suggestion. Like, if I was gonna Bootstrap, what I was, if if I was. You and I had your assets. And and and I was trying to bootstrap this31300:47:55.560 --> 00:48:09.619The Alliance: standard Internet marketing protocol these days is, have a low ticket item that you can sell for 20 bucks and upsell them to and then that you you do a webinar31400:48:09.770 --> 00:48:19.280The Alliance: where you sell a book that's 20 bucks, and the book becomes your upsell into a class. So what I would tell you to do is31500:48:19.770 --> 00:48:30.577The Alliance: start by figuring out what's the 50 like? What's the stickiest, most useful? 50, 30, whatever it is. Your your Mini Mini, and that's your low ticket item and31600:48:33.600 --> 00:48:56.650The Alliance: Then you want literally like a 3 h class or something. All we're trying to do is get the engine moving. And there's like, you know, I, my friend, dre, for example. He's not the world's greatest at this, but he's fine at us definitely to get people out of the gate. If you've got an email list or access to email lists.31700:48:57.980 --> 00:49:06.989The Alliance: he can literally like, build the funnel, run the cat like, do all the stuff on the back end. If you have the like. I've got the class, and I've got the book.31800:49:07.130 --> 00:49:28.130The Alliance: He can engineer all the rest for you for either. I think it's like a flat fee of $20,000 or $10,000 plus a cut, or he, he! He! Work. He works with high, level people. I usually like Joe Polish, my, you know, like at at Chris Voss, at A, at a significant level, but31900:49:28.330 --> 00:49:39.839The Alliance: is a friend, and I can call and be like, Hey, this is something you probably want to do. She's you know what I mean, like we could get you out of the gate with this. But, like then, all you're doing is, you've got a $20 product, and then you've got.32000:49:42.940 --> 00:49:56.419The Alliance: you know, I might like I might think of it as something different really, really, simply is, I would think of it as like a 3 h course into a community where clinician place clinicians can come to talk about how to use tech tools32100:49:57.031 --> 00:50:04.900The Alliance: and like I might like, I wouldn't like. Don't let it build an audience.32200:50:05.050 --> 00:50:12.659The Alliance: You know what I mean. Use the thing to build an audience. So you have customers, but like as you're doing it, the money that comes in from that32300:50:13.260 --> 00:50:19.540The Alliance: gets fed into filming your VR, your 1st VR pot thing that you wanna make for you?32400:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.080Amity Cooper: Bye.32500:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.599The Alliance: Right and along along the way right along the way. If you're writing a text.32600:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.520Amity Cooper: It's a long time. Yeah.32700:50:27.520 --> 00:50:39.869The Alliance: Yeah, this I mean, I like, I always like, what's the simplest stupid like? My my motto has always been this, I live by. This is, start by starting. How do you start by starting? Because as soon as you start, other people show up32800:50:40.070 --> 00:50:51.679The Alliance: resources, show up. People notice. You have no idea what is out there until you hang a shingle and start making some noise because people show up and32900:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.919The Alliance: you may not have to like, spend the money. You think you know what I mean. So I see.33000:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.550Amity Cooper: You know.33100:50:57.550 --> 00:50:58.890The Alliance: And if you.33200:50:58.890 --> 00:51:04.159Amity Cooper: Hitting walls like I for the last 5 years. So when33300:51:04.410 --> 00:51:21.330Amity Cooper: when we 1st started the conversation, you know, like I was like, Hey, I was really pissed off what was going on in Covid. Well, my response to that is that I I did a virtual summit. I had 16 speakers across industries talking about all these things, and I had over a thousand attendees33400:51:21.610 --> 00:51:22.919Amity Cooper: show up for that.33500:51:23.120 --> 00:51:29.929Amity Cooper: And it was my! It was like proof of concept that, like this topic, this area33600:51:30.280 --> 00:51:37.739Amity Cooper: is not being addressed, and I've been talking about it ever since. So then, on the back end of that virtual summit.33700:51:38.640 --> 00:51:47.029Amity Cooper: I created a course, and so I have an e-course out there, and but I can't sell it, and like I'm struggling, and I have.33800:51:47.030 --> 00:51:52.329The Alliance: Why can't so you so you why can't? Is the is the course bad? Or are you bad at Internet marketing?33900:51:52.330 --> 00:51:57.610Amity Cooper: Like I haven't been able to market it right like everything has changed in marketing from when I34000:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.259Amity Cooper: and and I'm just. I'm just.34100:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.510The Alliance: Do you have an email list? I do.34200:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.699Amity Cooper: No, but it's it's.34300:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.250The Alliance: Big, is it.34400:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.680Amity Cooper: Dead like I need to revive it.34500:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.229The Alliance: How big is it?34600:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.219Amity Cooper: 1,500 people, maybe.34700:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.799The Alliance: Okay, what do you mean? You need to revive it.34800:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.519Amity Cooper: Well, I don't. I I've been busy.34900:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.300The Alliance: Anything with it.35000:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.219Amity Cooper: I don't do anything with it.35100:52:19.410 --> 00:52:35.689Amity Cooper: So this week I'm actually featured at the Aca, which is the American Counseling Association, Virtual Summit, and I have a talk like it's going up, and they have 75,000 members. So like.35200:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.910The Alliance: So you've got. So yeah.35300:52:37.910 --> 00:52:44.550The Alliance: we you need to just like you've got the course. Now, you just need to take the book and turn it into like a smaller thing.35400:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.720Amity Cooper: Okay.35500:52:46.661 --> 00:53:02.949The Alliance: So you can have a loss leader. And then you have to solve, like some basic Internet marketing challenges which are usually like what you. So here's the the good news and the bad news. The bad news is the position you need to fill35600:53:03.310 --> 00:53:07.760The Alliance: is these motherfuckers make a ton of money, the good ones like35700:53:07.990 --> 00:53:18.019The Alliance: at a level that you like. You have no idea. The guy on my on my staff who does this this work and some other stuff for me makes more than I do35800:53:18.160 --> 00:53:30.420The Alliance: like. Yeah, they're like like, and that's like, it's a known thing you've got like, you're these guys. Actually, they make more than the CEO like. That's just what you end up making it more in the back end eventually. But like35900:53:30.980 --> 00:53:41.359The Alliance: they're they're heading up so much sales. They they get a cut, and people will like when we were running the Flow Research collective, our top sales guys would routinely get offers of like36000:53:43.780 --> 00:53:47.040The Alliance: a million dollars a month, and we were paying them, like.36100:53:47.190 --> 00:53:54.529The Alliance: you know, not a million dollars a lot less. And people they didn't quit because our mission. They were aligned with our mission, and they loved working for me.36200:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.900Amity Cooper: You know.36300:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.450The Alliance: But like honest to God, like they were getting offered36400:53:59.310 --> 00:54:07.820The Alliance: money that was so crazy. I was like, I don't even know how like I don't know how you do that as a company like I don't know, like I don't, what I don't know how you compete with that.36500:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.979The Alliance: The good news about that is, chat. Gb is really good at helping you. You need. So36600:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.410The Alliance: the in talking to you this is like36700:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.200The Alliance: a bunch of things are very clear.36800:54:22.210 --> 00:54:35.189The Alliance: one. I think you gotta work on that 50 page book. I think that like at first, st it'll distill your ideas down because it's essentially the talks you've been giving and all that stuff. You just haven't tried to write it down and order it up, and don't try to do it in a Herculean.36900:54:35.690 --> 00:54:43.225The Alliance: Don't try for a 500 page book yet literally like, what is the like? What is the thing I can sell to people?37000:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.630The Alliance: before I sell them a course.37100:54:46.103 --> 00:54:51.199The Alliance: That's just like 20 bucks. Because if you can get a thousand people online for a summit, once37200:54:51.310 --> 00:54:58.579The Alliance: you can do it again. And this is how we lot law like. I think you do it again, and you use it as a way to launch37300:54:58.840 --> 00:55:09.289The Alliance: a a new regular newsletter and sort of like you with a like a like a low grade, thought leader career, which means you need like you have to pick your platform.37400:55:09.810 --> 00:55:16.540The Alliance: Where you're. You know what I mean. And Youtube is probably where you're gonna wanna live. Cause it's the easiest one to monetize.37500:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.769Amity Cooper: But I don't know.37600:55:17.770 --> 00:55:22.969Amity Cooper: Pardon me, I like Linkedin a lot. But video, wise and Youtube.37700:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.219The Alliance: But what I would. What I would tell you is that the same content that goes on Youtube goes on Linkedin.37800:55:29.980 --> 00:55:36.041The Alliance: right? Right? Like it's how you language around it. But I think you use the same content in both places. And37900:55:37.550 --> 00:55:48.679The Alliance: the good news is like, if you've got a bunch of past video content reviews. Speaking, you've already got the basics. But, like you, you have to just build a pipeline for that. And there are a lot of AI tools at this point.38000:55:49.069 --> 00:55:58.960The Alliance: And you know, Chat Gbt will literally give you a list of like, hey? What does it take? I've got you know. What does it take to turn this into whatever you can learn them, or you can hire hire for them. Take your pick.38100:55:58.960 --> 00:56:06.029Amity Cooper: I'm trying to find somebody to build me an AI agent marketing sales team like I I.38200:56:06.410 --> 00:56:17.338Amity Cooper: This is where this is the disconnect. Right? So there's all this, all these new programs out there, all these new services. And yet none of us like can actually use them.38300:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.520The Alliance: So, Ali, why don't you text me? do you have like.38400:56:23.710 --> 00:56:30.040The Alliance: yeah. Text? Me, I'm gonna give you my phone number. It's (505) 901-2564,38500:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.029Amity Cooper: Say that one more time.38600:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.560The Alliance: (505) 901-2564.38700:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.800The Alliance: It's the easiest, easiest way to get me. I don't see emails very often, because I batch them.38800:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.850Amity Cooper: Sure.38900:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.819The Alliance: But if you can, and I want to do this via text. So39000:56:46.430 --> 00:57:10.969The Alliance: I want you to text me exactly what you're trying to find an AI agent to do. Hey, Steven? I'm I'm desperate to find an AI agent that could do and give it to me, and I'm gonna forward it to my friend Mike, who is dying to get on the phone. Me anyways. So he owes he owes me right now, cause yeah, he wants to talk to you about something, and I don't. I like him a a great deal, but he's the guy I know, like. So if you had a hundred $50,000,39100:57:11.240 --> 00:57:18.790The Alliance: and you want Mike to use AI to invent everything you need to start a company. He will over like the course of a month.39200:57:19.210 --> 00:57:29.069The Alliance: He'll build you a thousand videos. He'll build you like everything you would need. You don't have a role. It actually 1,500 people isn't big enough for him to be able to39300:57:29.260 --> 00:57:46.340The Alliance: do like he you can't. Your Rolodex isn't big enough to pay for it yet, like on the back end. But he's the guy who can do that. He's the geek. I know, who knows everything about the most practical. He's the practical AI question. So if we have lots of people who are asking practical AI questions like, How do you just? He's the guy39400:57:46.450 --> 00:57:52.280The Alliance: like the super marketer to the stars. Best friend of Tony Robbins, who just has figured out all the AI shit.39500:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.330Amity Cooper: Oh, okay.39600:57:56.330 --> 00:58:06.654The Alliance: So I could. Yeah, if you text it to me, I'll text it to him. And I'll put you guys on a like, I'm not. Gonna tell me you're in the alliance. I'm just gonna tell you, my friend and I'll put you on a call39700:58:07.130 --> 00:58:15.469The Alliance: but if I can, but he'll he'll he's gonna know the answer. It's gonna be like, you're gonna have to cobble together like 11 things to do it. But like it'll it's doable.39800:58:16.190 --> 00:58:19.710Amity Cooper: I know it's doable. That's the that feels39900:58:19.880 --> 00:58:31.080Amity Cooper: that is the most frustrating part, because, like, I know, all of these things exist. I've tried to teach myself, but it's like it's ridiculous, and.40000:58:31.080 --> 00:58:47.560The Alliance: Yeah, yeah, we got it. Like, yeah, you, it's very. It's very clear. It's yeah, no, it's it's really clear. So with you, I don't all that I like with you. It's really clear that we need to solve the money problem first, st so you can hire some of the talent. Start hiring some of the talent you need40100:58:47.810 --> 00:58:53.690The Alliance: and which means you've got to get. We gotta you gotta get40200:58:54.360 --> 00:59:02.210The Alliance: essentially that course to launch right now, there's a bunch of different ways to do it. You could do it, I mean, the the simplest way is, don't even worry about the book.40300:59:03.800 --> 00:59:10.439The Alliance: Figure out like you wanna start really small like I'm gonna reboot my newsletter and40400:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.299The Alliance: figure out, you know. Get people once a week.40500:59:15.820 --> 00:59:21.640The Alliance: give them a month's worth of content to reboot it 2 months worth of content, and then40600:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.909The Alliance: push people to towards a webinar40700:59:25.290 --> 00:59:28.979The Alliance: free webinar on this topic that pushes people towards your course.40800:59:29.480 --> 00:59:35.380The Alliance: See if you can sell 50 copies of the I don't know how much a course goes for, but.40900:59:35.380 --> 00:59:41.650Amity Cooper: Yeah, it's 2,500. And it comes with, it actually comes.41000:59:41.780 --> 00:59:48.000Amity Cooper: Everything's Thera, right? So it's called the Thera box. And I actually send you a book41100:59:48.310 --> 01:00:09.450Amity Cooper: I send you VR headset to play with. I send you a video like thing to be teaching everybody how to start incorporating and using these tech tools. And I have a workbook. It's 7 7 days. And it's it's a bootstrap. It's like, do this first.st41201:00:09.450 --> 01:00:13.000The Alliance: So you're totally. So you're you're styled, you're that's the41301:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.780The Alliance: like, I was a product developer like, I had a41401:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.559The Alliance: okay, yeah, okay. So you're styled on that. It's literally you have a marketing problem.41501:00:21.700 --> 01:00:26.110The Alliance: What's your war? How much money can you throw on a marketing problem? 041601:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.969The Alliance: $1,000? $10,000, $50,000.41701:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.599The Alliance: Give me a budget to solve your marketing problem.41801:00:32.600 --> 01:00:43.850Amity Cooper: Yeah, well, right now, it's 0 cause all that money is going into horses and whatever. So I, yeah.41901:00:43.850 --> 01:00:52.479The Alliance: It's fine. Okay, 0 is fine. It's just like, I don't care what the number is. So if you're starting from 0, you literally have no choice.42001:00:52.930 --> 01:01:05.089The Alliance: You have to reboot your newsletter and then sell your class because if you if it's $2,500 and you've got some base costs. So I you know I'm guessing after shipping, and whatever you're making $1,800 or so per class.42101:01:05.529 --> 01:01:05.969Amity Cooper: Yeah.42201:01:05.970 --> 01:01:15.120The Alliance: Okay? So the question is, what like after the42301:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.219The Alliance: should, is the goal just to get this class selling?42401:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.879The Alliance: Is that really the goal.42501:01:20.880 --> 01:01:43.479Amity Cooper: I wanna liquidate what I have. And I have 250 boxes sitting in storage, and I just want to fucking. Get my money out so that I can move on and do the next course, which is kind of where I'm thinking the VR system and all of the tech is gonna go to include my book42601:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.720Amity Cooper: in that package and then and and just update it.42701:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.570The Alliance: Alright. So so that's the. So, this is, this is really easy.42801:01:54.770 --> 01:02:00.010The Alliance: This is, I mean, like, I mean, I'm so doing, it is gonna doing it as a fucking nightmare. But.42901:02:00.010 --> 01:02:00.370Amity Cooper: Yeah.43001:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.619The Alliance: Operate like? What are the steps? What are you doing.43101:02:04.810 --> 01:02:05.710Amity Cooper: Like.43201:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.930The Alliance: You've got a website.43301:02:09.070 --> 01:02:11.400Amity Cooper: Okay, so, yeah.43401:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.619The Alliance: You built a funnel, has been optimized.43501:02:14.620 --> 01:02:20.192Amity Cooper: The the funnel has been my problem because I had a plan, and I43601:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.049Amity Cooper: no, it's not a good funnel. It's not a good funnel.43701:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.180The Alliance: Okay,43801:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.060The Alliance: go. Chase on. My staff43901:02:34.170 --> 01:02:53.109The Alliance: is pretty good with funnels. Who you met on my staff, who sold it. So Chase is excellent with funnels, and his friends are the best in the world at at funnels. So one, let's see if Chase will have a conversation with you about that about like the the I mean like this is his wheelhouse as well. So let me see if I can.44001:02:53.320 --> 01:03:00.120The Alliance: Yet he's with his family over the next little bit. But let me see if I can ask Chase to find some time to talk to you about44101:03:00.230 --> 01:03:14.099The Alliance: out, like the issues of getting from A to B with with where you are, because I have some. But to me it's really like it's pretty straightforward, in my opinion.44201:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.019The Alliance: Linkedin is challenging because Linkedin advertising is expensive.44301:03:20.280 --> 01:03:20.920Amity Cooper: Yeah.44401:03:21.320 --> 01:03:45.420The Alliance: It's expensive. It's not so like I. I've got a pretty good Linkedin audience, and we've been trying to figure out, how do I monetize it for flow for writers, because we're doing flow for writers as a digital only product this year. Also, the 1st time. it's $2,500 because you can't sell a product over like it's that's what it is. which is interesting. Because I'm like, Wow, I'm giving away, like.44501:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.899The Alliance: you know, a crazy crazy. But you're not gonna get Heidi, and you're not gonna get me.44601:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.710Amity Cooper: Ow feel about that, I mean is, I mean.44701:03:53.710 --> 01:04:10.920The Alliance: So I've wanted to do. So I've wanted to take flow for writers wide and really get like, like, and we're still gonna do lot. We're gonna still do the live, and it'll allow me to. What will happen is the course will become the feeder for live. So I'll have to do less basic stuff live and more like44801:04:11.060 --> 01:04:27.670The Alliance: cool writing stuff and all that like. So it'll it over time. It'll get fun. And I'm excited about it. So I'm not like. And this is it. This is, I've been wanting to do this for a while, anyways, because it's always important to have a product that sells without you having to do anything44901:04:28.060 --> 01:04:35.360The Alliance: right. And that's hard. It's but it's hard to do. It's really hard to do.45001:04:38.370 --> 01:04:44.120The Alliance: that's it. I like, I know all the people to do it, so I like that to me, is like your next steps are sort of like45101:04:44.230 --> 01:05:00.290The Alliance: their marketing steps, and they're starting to figure out like, what ha! Like, how do you want to spend the money like if if there's 250 boxes right. We know you're going to make about $200,000 when they're all when you've liquidated them.45201:05:00.670 --> 01:05:03.040The Alliance: $200,000 is, you know.45301:05:03.918 --> 01:05:10.059The Alliance: more than more than enough like it's more you could. You, if you took45401:05:10.470 --> 01:05:24.880The Alliance: the Irs is going to take a big chunk right. But you're going to be left with, you know, some $150,000 on 50 of it is going to go towards living, and $100,000 is going to go towards the next iteration.45501:05:25.380 --> 01:05:25.910Amity Cooper: Correct.45601:05:25.910 --> 01:05:30.644The Alliance: I know that's Steven's role, and when Steven talks about himself in the 3rd person is45701:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.808The Alliance: oh, my God, don't do that!45801:05:33.120 --> 01:05:50.880The Alliance: One of the rules I always try to live by, even even when I have the money is. I've done this with every business of mine that I've been happy with I, Bootstrap, all of them. I make my companies pay for themselves every step of the way. When I wanted to launch the Flow Genome Project, we did a live event.45901:05:51.590 --> 01:06:14.680The Alliance: We put 200 people who aren't at a hotel for a weekend, and I did a live event, and we put 200 people in the live event at like 2,000 per dollars a person. And I took that money and used it to launch the company like. That's how we did it. It never! And it didn't matter that I had money in the bank. I like. That's how I like to do things. I like things to pay for themselves from go makes me feel safe.46001:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.390Amity Cooper: So yeah, no to self. Do that.46101:06:20.085 --> 01:06:27.840Amity Cooper: Okay, I I have notoriously thrown money at things just because46201:06:28.550 --> 01:06:36.780Amity Cooper: I have a whim that I need to do, and I've learned I'm better at46301:06:36.780 --> 01:06:42.780Amity Cooper: I just I mean, the only reason I don't do it is because I've learned that you never end up getting that money back.46401:06:42.940 --> 01:06:43.470Amity Cooper: ever.46501:06:43.470 --> 01:07:00.689The Alliance: You don't make if you if the business is not, this is why I tell you to a lot of people in the Alliance the stuff that is really stuck with me. And it's not stuff I'm actually not the guy for this. But I am the guy to actually like is that. Wow! Most people haven't actually thought through the business side of the vision.46601:07:00.770 --> 01:07:25.099The Alliance: like, they're very clear on the vision. But the business side, like requires like people keep finding businesses that require onboarding too many new skills. It's too hard. You can't like. Nobody can do that. That's a money problem or a time problem and the time. Pro like it's too, it's too much. So it's you gotta solve it. It's gotta become a money problem. You gotta like find a business to make you the money to hire the talent you need.46701:07:26.770 --> 01:07:29.870The Alliance: So you you we gotta get you out of the gate. Strikes me.46801:07:30.310 --> 01:07:31.330Amity Cooper: Yeah.46901:07:31.660 --> 01:07:39.740Amity Cooper: yeah. Because then I think everything will. Well, I won't feel that pressure and that weight on my head and and heart of just trying to47001:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.769Amity Cooper: get my shit out into the world. And then this next iteration47101:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.740Amity Cooper: of a course is really the launching pad for47201:07:48.990 --> 01:07:56.959Amity Cooper: this e-learning platform, because that's what I want to really focus in on and build that up.47301:07:57.260 --> 01:08:07.390The Alliance: Okay. So I then to me, I'm gonna try to put you on the phone with face as a like sort of 1st step because he can. He can sort of47401:08:08.190 --> 01:08:27.040The Alliance: flesh out the components of of what you need. But I like I it's very clear to me that you need to reboot your newsletter. So like the 1st thing you need to do is write like 10 newsletters. So you have them. So that you can pump out one a week and stay way ahead of that curve right to just start revitalizing. So that, like, you know47501:08:27.260 --> 01:08:40.340The Alliance: that. And you know, make sure it looks kind of neat like, so you can re announce it, hey? I've read, you know, new newsletter. It looks different. Blah blah that's A AI canva problem more than anything else.47601:08:41.375 --> 01:08:41.950Amity Cooper: Right.47701:08:41.950 --> 01:08:50.200The Alliance: But I think that like that's to me like bare minimum. And you have to. You have to use that rekindled newsletter to47801:08:50.936 --> 01:08:56.773The Alliance: start to build towards class sales and simultaneously base is, gonna tell you this.47901:08:59.670 --> 01:09:02.830The Alliance: you might want to consider a Youtube channel.48001:09:03.815 --> 01:09:05.000Amity Cooper: I have one.48101:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.319The Alliance: Oh, you have one! How many fans any.48201:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.200Amity Cooper: No, not really.48301:09:11.324 --> 01:09:15.889Amity Cooper: I sort of like I I sort of created all of this stuff. And then48401:09:16.537 --> 01:09:24.420Amity Cooper: I lost momentum. I lost wind, and because I I and and that's my bad, you know. But.48501:09:24.420 --> 01:09:41.954The Alliance: No, it's this is what this is. What happens on long projects, I think. Like to me. The next steps would be, figure out, how do I get enough content to get start building a Youtube channel and start my newsletter? So I can push people towards a48601:09:42.920 --> 01:09:50.068The Alliance: webinar and or forget the Youtube for now. And just focus on the email, newsletter,48701:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.770Amity Cooper: And it just takes time. Yeah, but.48801:09:57.460 --> 01:10:08.320The Alliance: You got. I mean, there's there's there's gonna be no shortcut on this one like this is. Everything you wanna do is gonna require a bigger audience than you currently have now. So48901:10:10.670 --> 01:10:21.479The Alliance: you have. You have enough stuff that you can easily start selling if we can start, you know, getting that audience reactivated and moving. And that's like that's gotta start with email newsletters. So you gotta like49001:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.249The Alliance: they have to be great.49101:10:23.770 --> 01:10:31.419The Alliance: right? Like, that's the like. The the 1st challenge is, how do I take my book and turn it into49201:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.700The Alliance: 500 email newsletters that could go out twice a week for the next year?49301:10:39.030 --> 01:10:40.000Amity Cooper: Okay.49401:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.022The Alliance: Right? I mean something like that.49501:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.770The Alliance: that's an AI issue. I mean that that's a like.49601:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.810The Alliance: yeah, that's an AI, and you got a policy. So the most important thing, though. And this is really critical.49701:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.670The Alliance: Don't let AI do the writing49801:10:55.370 --> 01:11:13.429The Alliance: rewrite everything, because right now people are having an automatic reaction to that that you can sell when an AI has done the work and people are having bad reactions to it. And they're losing. You're losing eyeballs. So make sure you've got the yours just feels really human, you know. Really, you.49901:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.790Amity Cooper: So what I'm doing right now with the book. So I've done the outline, and I've taken50001:11:20.447 --> 01:11:31.209Amity Cooper: I have an assistant. And and she was pulling in all of the 25 plus interviews I've done this last year50101:11:31.270 --> 01:11:37.410Amity Cooper: and transcribing them and then applying them to all the research that I have.50201:11:37.460 --> 01:12:04.260Amity Cooper: and we're going to dump it into notebook. And I'm just. I'm trying to fill in the chapters with all of the topics that I've been talking about. And so it's my own words, and I'm just putting it in together. So I have this one working document that I can go back, and I can edit. And I can refine and improve upon and add the data and the research that it's needed or50301:12:04.260 --> 01:12:09.530Amity Cooper: making, you know, become the storyteller here and start filling in the spot.50401:12:09.530 --> 01:12:14.720The Alliance: Oh, I got it. Okay. Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright! I got I got I've got. I've got our next steps.50501:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.210Amity Cooper: Okay.50601:12:16.460 --> 01:12:23.360The Alliance: This, because this will go go dovetail right in with what you're doing in a useful way. You've got all this cauldron of stuff.50701:12:23.510 --> 01:12:30.969The Alliance: and we know you have to build up an email newsletter. The 1st thing I would start with is, I would do 2 things.50801:12:34.720 --> 01:12:43.989The Alliance: Let me give it to you in a Youtube context, when you want to build up a Youtube audience, the easiest way to do is draft off videos that have already gotten a thousand views. So if the video is called50901:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.010The Alliance: low in enlightenment, you would put up another video called Flow and Enlightenment.51001:12:49.140 --> 01:12:57.453The Alliance: So like, if it has a like. So sometime this year I'm gonna do this. All these motherfuckers will put up flow videos that like A. J. Shetty.51101:12:57.770 --> 01:13:21.409The Alliance: think of it like that, and and got millions of views saying, nonsense. I'm just going to create videos with the same title, because when you watch their video, you watch mine. Next, my point is, you have. There are people who do equine therapy do all the topics you're gonna be talking about out there in the world. They have videos out there, go find the videos that are really, really sticky, and see what the subject lines are.51201:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.629The Alliance: Match those subject lines to your content, in a sense51301:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.520The Alliance: and say, and you, you want a hundred51401:13:29.450 --> 01:13:52.259The Alliance: subject lines for email newsletters is really what you're going for, like, the 1st thing you want to do is, I need to do an email news like, if I'm gonna build this thing. The thing I know minimum is, I at least got to put out a newsletter a week for the next 2 years. Minimum. So right? Like, that's just like we, that's a no brainer. So you have to come up what you literally have to come up with a hundred 4 newsletters.51501:13:53.040 --> 01:14:16.510The Alliance: and right, and some pipeline for getting them written. I would say that like once you've got 10 in the system down. Okay, now it's time to start thinking about launch. But get the whole thing done. You you don't want to stall from momentum. You always want to know what's next. What do I have to do? What next? What do I have to do next? What do I have to do next? Because the grind is the grind, and if you don't know if you don't have those clear goals51601:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.779The Alliance: you'll just come off the rails.51701:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.710Amity Cooper: Alright backtrack.51801:14:20.850 --> 01:14:22.679Amity Cooper: Okay for Youtube.51901:14:22.890 --> 01:14:27.390Amity Cooper: Look at videos. What? What do I have to source? I have to.52001:14:27.390 --> 01:14:50.630The Alliance: So here's what you're trying to figure out. You're trying to figure out. You're trying to figure out what is re, what ideas are resonating with your customers to be so? What are they already watching? What are they reading? What is what is it called? What are those emails like? What headlines are getting their attention. All that stuff. Those have to become your headlines. That's how you you want to figure out52101:14:51.650 --> 01:14:56.029The Alliance: what I like. If there's a hundred people who are your absolute target customers.52201:14:56.680 --> 01:15:05.250The Alliance: What are they reading? What's catching their attention? What like right? And then you want to take that and map it back to? This is the contents of my book.52301:15:05.350 --> 01:15:23.889The Alliance: So what they're interested in, you know their interest is here. Oh, this section of my book is perfect for that. That's a newsletter right? Cause they already you already know they care about it, and you already know you have the content. So you're really just like looking for what is the steering guide for the 1,000 words I have to write.52401:15:24.040 --> 01:15:46.989The Alliance: And on top of all that this is gonna force you to do really cool stuff with your interviews like, Pull out. You know, email newsletters are going to be problem space. And when I was interviewing so and so, they said so and so and Block, you know what I mean like, that becomes a news level. Right? It's not. None of this is rockets problem with this is, it's so boring.52501:15:47.110 --> 01:15:58.070The Alliance: it's hard to stay focused in the end. It's not hard. The problem is ultimately that you start glazing with it over time. So like that's why I'm always like, get way ahead of it.52601:15:58.680 --> 01:16:05.609The Alliance: Schedule a day every month where you write new newslet like just talent. Get way ahead of it, calendar it out. This is the plan.52701:16:05.810 --> 01:16:21.989The Alliance: you know. One. If you if you get the newsletter pipeline going the next steps is really will come out of a conversation with Chase, and a couple of other people like you need Internet marketing help. So we either have to find somebody who loves your vision and just wants to cut.52801:16:23.010 --> 01:16:25.626The Alliance: And get right. And those people exist.52901:16:26.500 --> 01:16:30.759The Alliance: or you know what I mean or like that that kind of thing. But like53001:16:33.980 --> 01:16:48.640The Alliance: this shouldn't be that fucking like it's not. This is not like you did all the hard stuff already. You did the expensive stuff you did the hard stuff you've got the expertise like you've got like. Now, it's really just a question of oh, you gotta commit to the actual53101:16:52.530 --> 01:16:57.460The Alliance: Rand building that is becoming a thought leader. And this is by the way, most people hate this.53201:16:57.550 --> 01:17:22.991The Alliance: It's not fun. This is not fun. This is the like. This is why people. Everybody wants to be famous. Nobody actually wants to do what it takes to be famous, because this is what we. This is what everybody did. There's no other like it sucks. You gotta slowly build an audience and you and they and audiences are fickle. You like. You have to give them great content. They can't get elsewhere, and that they need so53301:17:24.070 --> 01:17:27.709The Alliance: But the good news is you don't need that many. I mean.53401:17:27.930 --> 01:17:29.819The Alliance: you may not need that. Many people.53501:17:30.740 --> 01:17:42.280Amity Cooper: I don't. I don't. I think my audience if I'm because I'm so focused on this particular group, this professional group.53601:17:42.910 --> 01:17:51.179Amity Cooper: There's only 800,000 of us. And we need we're short a million. But the this idea of like, if I can just capture.53701:17:51.430 --> 01:17:56.050Amity Cooper: I can just capture, you know, 5%, you know, like.53801:17:56.050 --> 01:18:01.319The Alliance: It's a big that's a big, that's a bit. I hear you. It's a big chunk. But I what I will tell you is this53901:18:03.540 --> 01:18:11.510The Alliance: If I work the numbers and your kit $2,500 and 1,800 is profit.54001:18:12.420 --> 01:18:16.680The Alliance: The question is, if you don't like54101:18:17.590 --> 01:18:33.930The Alliance: how much you know how much money do you want a month to like? Feed into your family? You know what I mean? And and then, on top of that, how much money a month you need for your company to make, so you can pay your assistant. And you know a social media marketer.54201:18:34.740 --> 01:18:46.480The Alliance: Right like that's like those are that like those, and and yourself a little salary? Those are really like. Those are the next questions, and when you start working the numbers I bet you come up at I've got to sell54301:18:46.750 --> 01:18:49.139The Alliance: 25 to 30 of these a month.54401:18:50.616 --> 01:18:51.910The Alliance: Right like.54501:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.680The Alliance: And54601:18:54.270 --> 01:19:14.579The Alliance: that's not. That's that's not terrible. You know what I mean. Like, you're a marketer. You're like you built like if I said, Hey, I need you to find me 30 customers a month. Could you help me do that right? You could, and you could give me the exact advice I needed. So the question I'm asking you is, what's your advice to yourself? If 3 months from now you want to start moving 30 units a month54701:19:15.070 --> 01:19:31.240The Alliance: right like that's really the puzzle you're trying to solve, or you know, or whatever whatever number you're happy with to start with, I don't know what your needs are and things like that. But that's how I'd start to think about that. And then it's just a question of like what gets me to launch and what keeps it sustainable? Yeah.54801:19:32.180 --> 01:19:37.789The Alliance: And those aren't like this is not a scary. This is a pretty simple puzzle, like dumb people sell 3054901:19:37.950 --> 01:19:39.860The Alliance: things a month. You know what I mean.55001:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.540Amity Cooper: Oh!55101:19:40.690 --> 01:19:41.940The Alliance: Dumb people with bad products.55201:19:41.940 --> 01:19:51.429Amity Cooper: Well, I have to say like, I'm a pretty sharp person, but for some reason like these details, they're beyond me, like I.55301:19:51.430 --> 01:19:59.290The Alliance: They're not beyond you. They're you're you're you've you. So you admit you've met, you've lost, you've lost sight of the most important truth.55401:19:59.480 --> 01:20:03.519The Alliance: which is the vast majority of people who run companies in America are stupid.55501:20:03.710 --> 01:20:20.610The Alliance: and they're stupid, because if you're stupid, you understand your customers. Most people are not super bright. So you actually have to be able to speak to your customers. It's a it's a truth like you can't sell to somebody whose language you don't speak to the people who do the best in business. If you go meet them, they're not dum-dum.55601:20:20.840 --> 01:20:33.010The Alliance: They're like they know how to do this stuff, but no more like, literally, it's like, it's. It's a wild experience. When you actually start meeting the people who run this country and run the companies that run this country because you're like Whoa55701:20:33.280 --> 01:20:52.749The Alliance: like. There's not a tremendous that they're not the giants. The mental giants like Sergey Brin and Larry Page are outliers in terms of like, you know, firepower. And so we have like the wrong idea about Ceos. As a general rule, they're not. They're not. So when you get really good intellects in this business world.55801:20:53.290 --> 01:20:58.130The Alliance: the stupid stuff fucks us up, not the hard stuff. Stupid stuff.55901:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.150Amity Cooper: That's true it is.56001:21:04.180 --> 01:21:13.940Amity Cooper: This has been a thorn in my side for years. It's just like I get. I'm like I got it. I got my newsletter going. I got this. I got that, and.56101:21:13.940 --> 01:21:18.650The Alliance: No, yeah, like, I literally like, this is I. What I, what I would literally do is.56201:21:18.940 --> 01:21:25.649The Alliance: do a customer analysis of your customers and figure out what shit they're really interested in. Take your book.56301:21:26.268 --> 01:21:42.281The Alliance: feed both into chat, gpt, and say, what are the 100 newsletters I should write. That's in the interactions of this is the market I want to tap into. This is all the information I have. What are the 100 newsletters that matter most here and56401:21:42.880 --> 01:22:08.617The Alliance: which ones are like already, almost written and need like lead. You know what I mean like if you you, if you hold on to the majority of my content that those are the questions I start answering, and then it's then the next step, like, once you have that the next step is okay. These have to be real newsletters. They have to be kind of amazing. So the next question is, do you want to take the time to figure out how to write those newsletters56501:22:09.210 --> 01:22:21.289The Alliance: and then hire a team to do what you just did. Do you want to write like you gotta figure out how busy you want to be in the beginning. I would tell you. You gotta figure out how to write those newsletters like right that. It's gotta be your baby.56601:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.259Amity Cooper: And yeah, yeah.56701:22:22.260 --> 01:22:46.170The Alliance: You can't hire for what you can't like. People need models so like, whatever it is, it's very clear to me that, like the 1st step. Which is you relaunching the newsletter, getting the ideas relaunch and getting 20 newsletters and relaunching the newsletter that's got to be you? Then you can start to make decisions about outside help. But like that's got to be used. So like, that's clearly got to be the next step. And I will get chase on the56801:22:46.230 --> 01:22:56.723The Alliance: phone with you. After that. This is very practical business advice. We're not. We're not doing flow stuff with you. We're just like this is this is, how do you start to build an audience and sell shit?56901:22:57.360 --> 01:23:05.799The Alliance: and how much previous video content, blog, content stuff do you have of yourself?57001:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.990Amity Cooper: A lot.57101:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.350Amity Cooper: I have a lot.57201:23:11.170 --> 01:23:21.569The Alliance: Do you have? The other thing you could do is literally like, so there's 2 ways to do Youtube content that are working for people long form content is king right now. So if57301:23:21.730 --> 01:23:29.659The Alliance: you are okay, I am not. I'm bad at this. So if you point a camera at me and just give me a topic and say, go. I don't have a lot to say.57401:23:29.890 --> 01:23:32.670The Alliance: If you interview me, I have a lot to say.57501:23:33.050 --> 01:23:39.840The Alliance: because I I sort of just like I I get. I don't like being on camera, so I just freeze after like 2 min57601:23:40.432 --> 01:23:52.389The Alliance: but if you interview me I'll talk for 15 h. Right? So that's essentially all we do is Ryan will get on the other end of a riverside call and interview me about57701:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.539The Alliance: 50 flow topics, and we'll just record it. And that's our next you 2, you know, that's57801:23:59.654 --> 01:24:03.070The Alliance: through the AI, and with bumpers and everything else that you know.57901:24:04.110 --> 01:24:05.840Amity Cooper: Yeah, okay.58001:24:06.560 --> 01:24:22.930Amity Cooper: I actually am very similar to you in that I I love talking, and if somebody asks me questions I'm happy to share, and then the rest is like but making the videos and the presentations and things like that. Oh, my God, it's torture for me! I hate it!58101:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.950The Alliance: Bye.58201:24:24.950 --> 01:24:33.460The Alliance: I have to go because we've now talked to 20 more minutes that in my I'm getting angry text from people whose meetings I'm skipping.58301:24:34.290 --> 01:24:35.790Amity Cooper: Oh, I'm really sorry. Thank you.58401:24:35.790 --> 01:24:53.750The Alliance: No, no, no, I like this was this was this was a slightly harder challenge. And I wanted us to get to like some like viable next steps that seem like, Oh, I can do this like this is cool. I got like, this is what I can do over the next 2, 3 weeks to get this a little bit farther.58501:24:53.750 --> 01:24:56.509Amity Cooper: Fully do it, and I will resend that brief to you, because.58601:24:56.510 --> 01:25:25.650The Alliance: Well, the but the other thing. The other thing is this, like this is the point of the alliance right? The point of the alliances like once you once you're sort of ready to relaunch the list. You've got 15 people who wanna help you succeed. So I I'm relaunching this list to sell my courses a clear next step for me. I you know I need help reaching as many clinicians as possible. Does any have any ideas or blah blah! You know what I mean. That's what the alliance is for58701:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.690The Alliance: And58801:25:31.190 --> 01:25:40.099The Alliance: you're a lot like, yeah, you're so much farther ahead, like ahead of a a bunch of people who are traveling the same path because you've actually got a product. So.58901:25:41.770 --> 01:25:45.939Amity Cooper: Alright. So okay, I'll let you go. But59001:25:46.190 --> 01:25:54.719Amity Cooper: the do. You still want me to follow up with you about that friend, or whatever with the AI person? Or do you want me to wait.59101:25:57.250 --> 01:26:00.779The Alliance: Which friend? With which AI person what did I forgot? Pardon me.59201:26:01.330 --> 01:26:01.950Amity Cooper: Who?59301:26:02.610 --> 01:26:04.290Amity Cooper: What's his name? Chris?59401:26:04.290 --> 01:26:06.010The Alliance: Chase. I'm gonna plug in here.59501:26:06.170 --> 01:26:06.900The Alliance: I'm gonna59601:26:06.900 --> 01:26:21.414The Alliance: yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna totally introduce. I'm gonna just as soon as we hang up. I'm gonna text chase and ask him to get on a call with you and talk like how to get some funnels to product. I'll walk him through where you're at a little bit, so you can have this conversation with with chase.59701:26:22.370 --> 01:26:48.510The Alliance: one thing to know with chase is time is really valuable, and he is, he will sit and listen to anybody as long as they talk like he's really he's amazing. But so my point is like, he'll you wanna talk sparingly, because it's really easy to waste time with Chase, and he doesn't have a lot of time. I've seen it like I've never seen anybody who does it. He like he literally doesn't59801:26:48.820 --> 01:26:55.818The Alliance: talk so. He gives all the people he works with so much space to talk. It's amazing. It's a really cool thing, but it's59901:26:56.486 --> 01:27:01.703The Alliance: If it, you know, Chase can give you a half an hour, and you wanna be able to use it kind of thing.60001:27:01.930 --> 01:27:09.859Amity Cooper: Right right before before you go. Remember how I was telling you about this guy, the Futurist, Bertolin Mesco. Can60101:27:10.300 --> 01:27:10.990Amity Cooper: this guy.60201:27:10.990 --> 01:27:14.850The Alliance: Your map of the future, learning how to navigate which shapes. Okay, cool. Let's go see it.60301:27:14.850 --> 01:27:18.490Amity Cooper: First.st This is the person that you need to reach out to.60401:27:19.810 --> 01:27:21.390The Alliance: I want to read his book first.st60501:27:22.050 --> 01:27:23.260The Alliance: I'll order it.60601:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.080Amity Cooper: Of course.60701:27:26.660 --> 01:27:31.530The Alliance: I'm a writer. I gotta read their book 1st up60801:27:32.181 --> 01:27:35.549The Alliance: I'll introduce you to chase there's a.60901:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.629Amity Cooper: And then I have a call with Ryan on the 20.th So.61001:27:38.850 --> 01:27:42.099The Alliance: Yeah. And I gotta tell Ryan what this call was about. He's just gonna like61101:27:42.220 --> 01:28:08.050The Alliance: check in to make sure you're moving forward and don't have any more questions. It really wasn't supposed to be scheduled on the 20. It was supposed to be like 2 to 3 weeks for this call, but I think Ryan, scheduling software got screwed up. So I may ask him to push your call out a little bit. So you have a like a couple more weeks to like. Push these projects a little bit, for like, I want you to get on a call with Ryan and have a hundred blog topics and 20 straps for email newsletters done.61201:28:08.590 --> 01:28:09.230Amity Cooper: Okay.61301:28:10.087 --> 01:28:20.192The Alliance: Like, if you're actually there by next week. You know what I mean. If you're there by the time you talk to Ryan, and you've talked to Chase. It's really a question of61401:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.729The Alliance: Then it's just a question of long, of of like doing it right like61501:28:24.910 --> 01:28:37.769The Alliance: and customer tracking and all that like, do you? How are you? How are you keeping track of your customers like those with email, Newsletter? You need software to send it out and track your customers just because sort of think of that route a little bit.61601:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.510Amity Cooper: But it's it's really just61701:28:41.730 --> 01:28:49.760Amity Cooper: sitting there. And it's not activated. Nothing, nothing that I have all of my systems. Everything are just sitting there because I got61801:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.060Amity Cooper: sidetracked.61901:28:53.650 --> 01:29:00.376The Alliance: Life is life, life is life the most. So. So 2. Yeah, 2 things before I go seriously.62001:29:01.480 --> 01:29:22.701The Alliance: stop beating yourself over over like lost time, because it's not gonna it's not coming back anyways, and all you're doing is making it harder to go into the future. You know this right like it. It just is what it is. Life life punches you in the fucking mouth. And 10 years from now you're gonna be like, oh, this is why that happened. I'm so glad that happened, but for now it just punches you in the fucking mouth. So62101:29:23.010 --> 01:29:36.500The Alliance: yeah, but you can't like you can't be super mad at. You can't hold that grudge because it's it kills momentum. And you like more than anybody I in the in the classes. I've seen. You actually are going to have the most fun62201:29:37.040 --> 01:30:06.589The Alliance: writing up a clear goals list every day and checking them all off because the little momentum of forward progress is going to get really addicted to you because it's been missing from your life because you can't hospice care doesn't have forest progress. It just has. I'm like juggling chainsaws and hoping for the bad like there's no like, for, like the person is dying, you don't want forward progress, you know what I mean, and and you don't like it's all of it. All of it is. I know what I've been on the other end of that, and it doesn't. So you like momentum comes from62301:30:07.650 --> 01:30:12.169The Alliance: click. This is my clear goals. List for the day. Have you been setting your clear goals list every day?62401:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.960The Alliance: No, no.62501:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.950Amity Cooper: So, yeah, so one. So one, it's a 1.62601:30:19.190 --> 01:30:19.920Amity Cooper: They roll it.62701:30:19.920 --> 01:30:38.800The Alliance: So you yeah, you gotta like, get us, get on top of setting that clear goals list with the whatever it is. Figure out how many things would be an excellent in a day and put them on the list. Make sure like here, here's the thing. Here's what I would look at if I was like, Okay, I need a hundred email newsletters62801:30:39.320 --> 01:30:43.109The Alliance: like, I'm like, all right, that means I need 10 ideas62901:30:43.300 --> 01:30:59.770The Alliance: a day for the next 10 days, and it turns out that there it goes, faster than it's 20 a day for 5 days, and then I need to start fleshing them out into content. And it's probably gonna be one or 2 a day, or whatever and like that's those are your clear goals like that's and just start63001:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.519The Alliance: advancing it.63101:31:02.750 --> 01:31:03.240Amity Cooper: Okay.63201:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.180The Alliance: This? Yeah.63301:31:05.067 --> 01:31:11.980The Alliance: So you have to clear goals, chase conversation.63401:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.660Amity Cooper: Delay, Ryan.63501:31:18.450 --> 01:31:27.640The Alliance: Delay, Ryan and the the newsletters right?63601:31:28.470 --> 01:31:32.079The Alliance: The next. The next step is, you know. Aha! Is is it 2 years.63701:31:32.352 --> 01:31:42.179Amity Cooper: Yeah. And I just need to review. I just need to look at my funnel. And I, just I I need to do an inventory and see what I have. That's been sitting and how to.63801:31:42.390 --> 01:31:44.450Amity Cooper: Yeah, okay, I got it.63901:31:45.260 --> 01:32:09.461The Alliance: You could also feed that entire inventory into Chat Gpt, and that's like for steering right? I see classes in Chat Gbt all the time. And I'm like, Okay, I've got these 5 classes. I want to turn them into one where the intersections I never let it build for me, but I always let it find the intersections because of the pattern recognition system, and it always tends to find the obvious shit that I don't find, because I'm trying to be clever.64001:32:09.910 --> 01:32:14.040The Alliance: alright, I'm gonna jump.64101:32:14.540 --> 01:32:15.720The Alliance: Was this useful.64201:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.830Amity Cooper: Yeah, yeah.64301:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.199The Alliance: Then my work here is done. I will see you tomorrow if you're coming.64401:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.589Amity Cooper: That you didn't get my brief, but I'll set reset.64501:32:26.590 --> 01:32:27.919The Alliance: Send it back to me again.64601:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.720Amity Cooper: I would have looked at it. Anyways, I'm so buried trying to finish this book.64701:32:31.950 --> 01:32:35.619The Alliance: With Peter. I gotta get it in by the by, Monday.64801:32:37.670 --> 01:32:39.040The Alliance: Yes, the like64901:32:39.220 --> 01:32:51.199The Alliance: final like, it's literally like, I'm the final like massaging. But it's all the stuff that's been broken forever that I really like didn't want to fix, because I was like, oh, these are. They're boring65001:32:51.510 --> 01:33:10.369The Alliance: hard fixes to certain like block sections that have to be there, though it's it's yeah. It's just 2 days. It's like 2 days of like, it's sort of what you have to do and and it's been going on now for like 10 days in between phone calls with alliance members which have been wonderful. But in between. All I'm doing is like65101:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.869The Alliance: make trying to make sentences sound human because they just sound academic65201:33:15.060 --> 01:33:20.720The Alliance: in these sections. It's fine. Pardon me.65301:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.270Amity Cooper: Did you cut yourself.65401:33:22.750 --> 01:33:23.470The Alliance: No.65501:33:23.470 --> 01:33:26.740Amity Cooper: Oh, is is that? Is that just from the cigarette.65601:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.809The Alliance: Oh, where are you looking.65701:33:29.430 --> 01:33:33.250Amity Cooper: On on your right hand, your index finger.65801:33:34.230 --> 01:33:36.230The Alliance: Oh, there's Schmutz at my end of his finger.65901:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.970Amity Cooper: Yeah.66001:33:37.050 --> 01:33:49.190The Alliance: It's actually pro. Oh, it's it's actually a lot of it's soil. I was enjoying the garden and lying with the dogs. And it's probably now ash from my cigarette on top of it.66101:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.679Amity Cooper: Oh, I was like, what did you do? Okay.66201:33:52.680 --> 01:34:19.060The Alliance: No, I'm not bleeding. Though that would not be. That would happen. I would absolutely get on a zoom call like bleeding from a cut in my head. They used to tell these stories about Chick sent me high. He was the same way. He was a little known fact about chick sent me high, is he? Was actually an action sport athlete like a serious one. He was a mountaineer and a rock climber, and he was very serious. He had a house in Montana used to stake all the time. He was really in nature a lot. No, people don't know this about him, but he was a66301:34:19.200 --> 01:34:36.210The Alliance: it's sort of a Klutz, and he was. He's like he's wired like me, and so he would come into class on Monday with like bruises and cuts all over his face and body like he would look like he got beat up because he had been out like rock climbing, mountaineering. He'd fallen down a ravine, or something.66401:34:36.380 --> 01:34:41.877Amity Cooper: Oh, my God! I can't even can't even imagine.66501:34:42.600 --> 01:34:53.889The Alliance: I know it's pretty great. It'd be that. It's it's why Mike and I were friends like he was he he was secretly he was secretly one of us just disguised as an academic. All right, I gotta go.66601:34:54.120 --> 01:34:54.790Amity Cooper: Okay.66701:34:54.790 --> 01:34:56.380The Alliance: It was lovely seeing you.66801:34:56.530 --> 01:34:58.559The Alliance: I'll see you tomorrow, bye.66901:34:58.560 --> 01:34:58.880Amity Cooper: Bye.
