WEBVTT100:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780The Alliance: Hey! How are you, sir.200:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.339Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I'm good. How are you?300:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.720The Alliance: Good man.400:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.215Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Hey? Thanks for keeping the time. I apologize. I know that the team tried to move it. Tomorrow is my500:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.820Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: youngest high school graduation.600:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.020The Alliance: Oh, no! Worries, no worries. You're fine.700:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.359Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I gotta show up.800:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.450The Alliance: Of course, not a problem.900:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.689Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I don't even know where to begin.1000:03:22.850 --> 00:03:34.939The Alliance: Yeah, it looks so it looks like I wanna. I've looked at the review notes from your call with Ryan in our last call. It. Seems like you're firing in all cylinders is what it looks like to me.1100:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.129Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: In what way.1200:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.270The Alliance: It just seems like the like. You've really adopted the protocols. You've taken on enough of it that a lot, if you pick and choose.1300:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.549The Alliance: Do this as a menu.1400:03:49.410 --> 00:04:14.779The Alliance: you'll get some results, but it's designed to work synergistically. And so the more of these things you do, the faster you go. And the stabler it is, and right? And the stability is also important because it prevents burnout. So anyways, it looks, it just looks like you've got a lot going on on the accountability front, which is usually where I start. These calls, you know, scale of one to 10. I think you're you're up there. What do you think.1500:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.598Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I do, I think, you know, going through the other 2 programs like, I, I hit the ground running with this one, you know.1600:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.109Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: so that felt good. The creativity part. That's the piece that I got to plug in more. You know, and I knew jumping into this thing.1700:04:32.650 --> 00:04:44.029Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: There's never good timing, right? And so I thought, man, I'm just gonna dive in and and go for it. But it's what I expected. We're literally reorganizing the entire firm.1800:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.019Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and so like stuff is just flying at me. So trying to carve out that that's my biggest challenge right now.1900:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.030The Alliance: Yeah.2000:04:53.332 --> 00:04:54.600The Alliance: I hear that.2100:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.099The Alliance: It's the only yeah. Again, with the creativity.2200:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.619The Alliance: The funny thing about that is a little goes a long way. I mean, you literally could do a2300:05:05.500 --> 00:05:22.880The Alliance: 5Êmin drawing in between a couple of things. Just all you're really trying to do on a regular basis is like, remind your brain that there are other perspectives, so it will shift brain rather than lock you in. Essentially.2400:05:23.260 --> 00:05:32.510The Alliance: there's a thing that happens when we experience the world. There's a gap between how, when information comes in and we turn it into meaning.2500:05:32.670 --> 00:05:41.429The Alliance: and the longer we can hold stuff in that gap before saying, it means exactly this, the more creative we actually are.2600:05:41.450 --> 00:06:03.630The Alliance: Right. So a lot of the stuff we're trying, that's how you start to fuck with framing and mindset and bias you just that's what pasa trains, that's all the all. These things sort of surround it that when they say beginner's mind, that's what they actually mean. That's what they're talking about from a physiological, neurophysiological standpoint. It's and there's a there's a bunch of different2700:06:04.050 --> 00:06:15.006The Alliance: terms for it. laden inhibition is is actually the inverse of it. But people mistakenly use. That doesn't matter. Repetition for suppression is often what it what it's called2800:06:16.500 --> 00:06:32.409The Alliance: because, like, it's how many times do you have to see a stimuli before you tune it out completely? Also. Right, like the 1st time you see the Grand Canyon. Oh, my God! The second time! 3rd time you're like there's a big hole in the ground off to my left of my way to the gift shop right.2900:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.130Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Right, yeah.3000:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.920The Alliance: That right? So you're, it's the inverse of that. Basically.3100:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.919Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay, that makes sense.3200:06:39.600 --> 00:06:53.700Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You know, it's interesting with the yeah, because with the we talked about that on our 1st call, and it, you know I use the ones that you had. And and then I found, oh, man, the one that I'm doing fits that. So I I've got that practice involved.3300:06:54.274 --> 00:07:06.949Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: We talked before about the physical activity. That's good. It's interesting. I was thinking about about this on Saturday. I we did a psilocybin trip with a bunch of business guys.3400:07:07.170 --> 00:07:20.400Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and one guy that we brought into the fold which a couple of guys knew him vouched for him. That kind of thing. He's a producer, and he wrote, he's he's done a couple of things for the history Channel3500:07:20.950 --> 00:07:29.170Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: on psychedelics in Saskatchewan. So we had a a guy that kind of did the universal healthcare here3600:07:29.678 --> 00:07:36.300Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: as a premier in the province, and he said, hey, man, if it helps people, let's go for it right up until the summer of love, when everything was3700:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.359Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: schedule one and all that kind of thing. So it was a fascinating conversation, total, creative.3800:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.500Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: But we were talking about3900:07:43.820 --> 00:07:50.760Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: this kind of stuff. If I'm understanding it correctly. What I'm trying to do is get my brain to move laterally4000:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.010Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: right. Is that accurate.4100:07:54.010 --> 00:08:02.640The Alliance: Well, you're trying to make more. I'm trying to teach you how to. Well, lateral thinking is a4200:08:02.920 --> 00:08:25.230The Alliance: low will amplify lateral thinking. A lot of the work we're doing is meant to amplify lateral thinking, especially the writing exercise for this month. That's a real like. That's a very that like that's a sort of a lateral thinking play. Exercise a little bit where it'll really amplify that. I am. And4300:08:26.210 --> 00:08:48.490The Alliance: lateral thinking increases with practice. You have to like sort of practice, starting to like, connect, really disparate ideas and teaching yourself that like, oh, good things come out of that right. You have to sort of train your brain that like when it makes those connections for you, you're gonna do something with it. And so a lot of that is slow. But one of the main reasons we're doing like the drawing exercises is4400:08:49.850 --> 00:08:58.850The Alliance: we build frames around every bit of information. It's context. Frame and frames are the most.4500:08:59.120 --> 00:09:28.769The Alliance: the easiest place to intervene, and the chain between frames, mindset and bias, mindset and bias are harder to fuck with, because bias is totally unconscious, and you can only fuck with it through mindset. And mindset is sort of like an enduring frame. Right? It's mood plus frame over time, basically is mostly what you're going to get for a mindset. So like you are most powerful messing with frames and messing with frames really doesn't mean anything more than whenever you're sure of something.4600:09:29.470 --> 00:09:39.730The Alliance: ask yourself why you're so sure. Why am I certain? Is there another way to see this right that will train lateral thinking? But if you the drawing exercises because it's4700:09:39.730 --> 00:10:01.179The Alliance: you're outlining, you're seeing negative space. It's training the brain to also to notice the inverse. You're train. You're training the brain, like around other things, so like that skill is trained and drawn, but it starts to get applied to intellectual things and whatever and when it does. And you start to notice those patterns, you get dump in more flow. So all it works synergistically.4800:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.630Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay, that makes sense alright.4900:10:04.090 --> 00:10:09.089The Alliance: What? What else could? So that's accountability and stuff, Doc, you brought some questions in with you.5000:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.829The Alliance: What do we have for you today?5100:10:10.830 --> 00:10:21.000Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, just the main thing was on the on the creative creativity space. So in my mind, always goes down to like what we talked about on the last call5200:10:21.170 --> 00:10:29.489Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: was that the Mtp. What was enlightening was, hey? The Mtp doesn't have to be this big, vast thing right? So5300:10:30.041 --> 00:10:36.879Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I've set the high, hard goals. A few of them inside of that business idea that we talked about.5400:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.000Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you know, serving the the businesses that are 5 million, and under the blue collar type of businesses.5500:10:42.448 --> 00:10:52.250Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Started to put that team together, reached out into the community, hired a consultant on that so that the team's going through. We start in July with that. So it's a 6 month.5600:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.869The Alliance: It's great!5700:10:52.870 --> 00:10:59.890Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, with Ceg worldwide that type of thing. So my biggest question is5800:11:01.050 --> 00:11:09.660Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: the creativity piece. And I think you already answered that with the small little bits, because I'm thinking my mind's always going to. Okay, I've got to get into flow.5900:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.840Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So then I need to find 45Êmin somewhere in this.6000:11:12.840 --> 00:11:35.189The Alliance: No, no, with the creative microdosing like. That's why I said the drawing exercise. Some of most of them are 10Êmin long. They're meant to be done between deep work tasks. These are little things that I want you to do throughout the day as transitions between phases, right? Instead of doing other stuff. I like to draw or6100:11:35.500 --> 00:12:04.100The Alliance: play the end of my day before I have to come back and integrate my family. It's a thing that allows me to. I'm gonna do my active or priority protocol. After I talk to my wife and figure out what all the shit that I gotta deal with, because she's gonna overload me right? I'm gonna come home. So there's no sense doing active recovery before I come home, and she overloads me. But if I go straight from work to home. I'm not available. I'm still in work mode. I'm still my fucking head. So I6200:12:04.240 --> 00:12:16.570The Alliance: end my day with a 10Êmin drawing exercise almost every day before I go home, because then I'm more available with my wife. She gives me all the all the other stuff I need. Then I go into my active recovery.6300:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.970The Alliance: because then my day actually ends.6400:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.532Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That makes sense. Okay? And then, from the the creative writing standpoint which I did at the flow for writers,6500:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.180The Alliance: Yeah.6600:12:25.180 --> 00:12:41.059Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: You know, I had a concept in mind, and so we were stealing styles and that kind of thing in there. And I was using those styles, is there the effectiveness? My mind is always going now to this Mtp. This business plan, dealing it back.6700:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.920Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So I go to steal a style, and I'm I'm writing kind of a business kind of thing inside.6800:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.219The Alliance: Dude. That's what I was. Gonna tell you. I mean, like with you. If I was stealing, I mean so.6900:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.160The Alliance: But also remember, let me.7000:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.659The Alliance: Let me mention something to you.7100:12:57.110 --> 00:13:25.966The Alliance: I'm an incredibly effective business copywriter, right? We sent you a couple of emails. And I sent you a $40,000 product. Right? You're sitting on the other end of this because those I told stories in those emails, I'm an effective storyteller. So yes, you wanna like, learn how to do what Clayton Christensen does because he's a good business writer. There's other, you know what I mean, Tony Fidel, and Build has a really personal style. That's fun. Good business book,7200:13:26.970 --> 00:13:38.930The Alliance: But there are other writers where you're like. Oh, they're really good compelling storytellers like they hold my attention. Oh, well, you're going to need everything. Effective communication is is a war for attention7300:13:39.160 --> 00:14:02.559The Alliance: and storytelling. You have a business story to tell. You may tell it in more businessy languages. But you have to remember, like one of the reasons I'm deadly effective at my job is because I'm trained as a poet, and that's like. I don't use poetry, but poetry forced me to. What if you're a poet? Take a flow of writers? You know I do this. You spend7400:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.710The Alliance: years, putting words side by side, green penguin, blue penguin, purple penguin, bleeding penguin.7500:14:09.810 --> 00:14:25.350The Alliance: and and seeing how they make you feel so. You have this innate sense of what feelings words create when you put them together. So you know how to create the emotions you want in your readers. I can't teach you that I could tell you it happens.7600:14:25.380 --> 00:14:41.670The Alliance: and then I can say, this is how you do it. But you're going to have to develop those innate patterns for yourself, because it's an unconscious skill. You will never consciously know. You know how to do that. You will just be good at it, and it will keep happening. I can't tell you7700:14:42.560 --> 00:15:04.429The Alliance: why. I'm like, you know what I mean. Even now, when I write like I could just tell you oh, I need a word here that oh, this is the word right? Like there's no, I'm not like Steven's not there. You know what I mean, I finished. I'm finishing. I finished a novel today, my new novel, which is hugely crazy and fun and neat, and you know I'm still not exactly sure who wrote that book.7800:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.370The Alliance: As a matter of fact, I don't know who wrote that book at all. Like.7900:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.850Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.8000:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.489The Alliance: That's sort of like a magic trick that I was involved in. So8100:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.475The Alliance: But8200:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.589The Alliance: one of the things that's most important, and this is the thing I want to stress8300:15:21.760 --> 00:15:30.579The Alliance: is the thing with creative microdosing is, progress comes from tiny little bits8400:15:30.900 --> 00:15:58.689The Alliance: on a regular basis, because you're also every like it's it's literally consistency with it, like it's just do. It don't care no pressure. 5Êmin great, 2Êmin great, literally. If it's 2, you could literally get. Probably get. 1st of all, you could actually probably learn to draw in 3Êmin a day like you'll get better months down the road. You'll be better. It just will happen. Using his Toby's style. And you can do it really fucking fast.8500:15:59.161 --> 00:16:26.929The Alliance: But it's really just about how it forces you to always like. Remember that you're a creative. So it forces you to stop and think slightly differently. And most people, what happens is when most people are faced with the challenge, they get narrower. But if you're a creative and you know that solutions come from thinking broader, you will override that automatic response. The interior singular cortex will not do8600:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.200The Alliance: in response to fear what it does to most people, and you'll have more flexibility and creativity whenever8700:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.919The Alliance: okay, so8800:16:33.920 --> 00:16:47.460The Alliance: like those are all the goals right? And I really like the creativity. It shouldn't be like it could be tiny. It's why I call it creativity, Microdosing. It's just, it's literally like I. It's a synergistic practice. And as long as you're just doing a little bit.8900:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.230The Alliance: you're fucking great. You know what I mean.9000:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.380The Alliance: Yeah, you're fine.9100:16:51.380 --> 00:16:58.510The Alliance: great! And I would with the the business stuff, like, you know, like what I would tell you to do is9200:17:00.800 --> 00:17:13.329The Alliance: like Malcolm glad will be a really good style for you to steal. Michael Lewis would be a really good like. Those are really good storytellers in the business world, Steven Johnson. I don't know if you've never read Steven Johnson.9300:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.765The Alliance: Great book is where good ideas come from great book on innovation. I think he's great.9400:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.459Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay.9500:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.450The Alliance: And9600:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.980Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay, so no other track. Yeah.9700:17:25.980 --> 00:17:32.000The Alliance: Yeah, no, no, no, you're you're really on track. What I you just have to on you. What all I'm saying is you have to.9800:17:34.940 --> 00:17:50.570The Alliance: It's slightly like you, slightly above, like just a slight, wider definition of like I want to be. Of course you want to be a better writer for business. Why don't you do it? Of course it's that actually having a target is great. You just have to remember that, like more9900:17:50.650 --> 00:18:11.149The Alliance: variety of skills will come in better. So you got to ask yourself for great business writing. Am IA great storyteller? Can I tell a great business story? Not backs Brahman like the marketing. That sort of stuff, can I? You know? And how do you tell a great story quickly? So like, for example, like10000:18:11.570 --> 00:18:37.749The Alliance: there's a lot of use value. I get a lot of use value. You could all the like award winning magazine ad copy from the nineties when there were magazines, is still online, all those communicate. So this. So I will go practice. I'll go like long form ads when they were like full page ads and magazines that had stories in them. But they're only like, you know what it is. It's like a 500 word story. They're gonna sell me something like perfume. Or you know, dental work, or whatever.10100:18:37.790 --> 00:18:53.519The Alliance: I want to know how they did that, too. Like, that's the stuff I look at, because I'm like, Oh, wow! That's like these were really, that's really expensive real estate and really smart people played on that. And you know, if it was an effective campaign, how did they do that I learned more from a pocket Rabone.10200:18:53.730 --> 00:19:14.139The Alliance: a Cologne campaign from the eighties about how to write dialogue than almost anything else, like literally like a magazine campaign from the eighties for this cologne they were trying to like do flirty dialogue over the phone right in print ads. And they had a page, and if you can do flirty.10300:19:14.410 --> 00:19:34.779The Alliance: funny, like I was, it's almost everything I needed to learn to write like character dialogue, at least the happy stuff that I still, if you look at my fiction, you see, you could literally see the ad campaign that I learned, but I learned how to do it, because I was like, how do you tell? Really cool like flirting is like, you know, that's a fun feeling10400:19:34.830 --> 00:19:48.239The Alliance: for me to be able to list it. Maybe not exactly right for you, but in a sense you are flirting with your clients, too. It's just a different kind of flirting, right? In a sense, you're flirting with their bank account and their possibility, their future space. Right? So10500:19:48.240 --> 00:20:09.490The Alliance: those are questions I look at. I also look at English advertising a lot because they use irony in their ads, and nobody in America does that. We don't. We don't. Every now and again you'll get like Dollar Shave Club, and they'll do it. But most people don't know how to do it, but the fucking English do it all the time, and it's all over Europe. And I'm like, Okay, how do you do that? Because, like, that's interesting. Laughter sells, you know.10600:20:09.490 --> 00:20:15.230Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, interesting. Okay, that that sets me on a nice track. Because when I think about10700:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.735Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you know from this, this Mtp down to the high, hard goals to the daily tasks and that kind of thing. So the10800:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.280Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you know, the typical business owner. They're all kind of the same. They're they're locked into10900:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.773Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: their day to day into that whirlwind.11000:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.450The Alliance: You like sports.11100:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.870Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.11200:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.330The Alliance: Are you a sports, guy? Which sports are you football?11300:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.190Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah. Football.11400:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.430The Alliance: American.11500:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.190Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah. Nfl.11600:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.359The Alliance: You've picked the hardest one. But11700:20:44.049 --> 00:20:53.840The Alliance: football writing is really hard, because it's the the more bodies on the field the worse the writing is the best sports. Writing is always golf and baseball.11800:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.610Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah.11900:20:54.610 --> 00:21:04.639The Alliance: Right, because there's or tennis, because there's literally 2 people moving with football you're like. But there is. So Mark Bowden wrote a book about the Philadelphia eagles from like.12000:21:04.910 --> 00:21:11.589The Alliance: I want to say, the eighties great book! It's best football book I've ever read. And he's a dope writer. But I would tell you like12100:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.960The Alliance: bomb12200:21:13.350 --> 00:21:22.209The Alliance: magazine writing like you, I would find football writers, because those are stories, and you like football anyways, so like12300:21:22.540 --> 00:21:34.250The Alliance: find a writer that's telling stories that you're naturally interested in. Just be like I'm cause. What here's the amazing thing that you're gonna find is, if I if you were to spend the next 2 weeks, 2 weeks.12400:21:35.110 --> 00:21:44.569The Alliance: maybe 3, but 2 weeks, like telling sports stories, trying to like steal, like just figuring out how that works. And then 3 weeks from now go back and tell a business story.12500:21:44.820 --> 00:21:55.139The Alliance: That's when you're gonna go holy shit, this stuff works, because then you're gonna go into business with all these. They feel unrelated. But you have a pattern recognition system for the brain.12600:21:55.140 --> 00:22:16.749The Alliance: You don't have to do the work of relating it. Your brain's gonna do it automatically as soon as it sees the opportunity to connect the skills. You literally just have to do the work to level up your skills and let your brain take care of the usefulness. People get this wrong all the time. They want everything they're doing to be useful. Now it becomes useful later, because the brain does it automatically.12700:22:16.750 --> 00:22:40.520The Alliance: I will tell you that, like I, above everything I've been trying to work on for like the past 3 years. This weekend was the weekend when my brain went. Oh, yeah, it's all done like it's time for the next degree, like, where what's the next? Let of set of goals like you finished? Your 3 books are almost all but done. The alliance is set. We know we're doing next year, like all of it's mapped. Okay? So what like, we're, we're next. And12800:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.819The Alliance: a suited like, literally, like12900:22:43.090 --> 00:22:51.720The Alliance: 7 years of stuff that was percolating together just came together and went. There you go. Here's your plan for the next 5 and13000:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.260The Alliance: I was thinking about how.13100:22:56.740 --> 00:23:11.339The Alliance: if I tried to force that to happen along the way I tried to make bits and pieces. I thought about pieces of it, but it wasn't like the time wasn't right like it wasn't like, there's always a gap. And I was like, I just let it go. I'm like, Okay, cool. Let it go. But like13200:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.230The Alliance: I can't, you can't plan for that. You just have to be confident that it's going to happen13300:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.660The Alliance: right? Like13400:23:18.020 --> 00:23:35.739The Alliance: it's the. It's the funny when the student is ready that the teacher emerges that Chinese martial arts thing. I don't know if that one is true. I have it like, sometimes that happens in my life. Sometimes I'm the teacher, and I gotta do it the hard way. But what I have found is that like, when the person is ready.13500:23:36.400 --> 00:23:45.906The Alliance: the idea always emerges that I found right like that seems to be consistently true with my life and with most people's lives.13600:23:46.890 --> 00:24:00.940Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, you know what that is really fascinating, Stephen, because, you know, I think about there is a writer he's internal to to the financial services industry. But he's really really good and just a voracious reader. But he had a seminar13700:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.330Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: on this, boys. This is a football13800:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.170Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: right? And what he was doing was getting.13900:24:07.300 --> 00:24:19.300Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: you know, the the Green Bay packers and that kind of thing, and and saying, You know, you gotta simplify everything. So as soon as you said that I'm linking at the business owner is literally looking at a football field. I got these people going this way and that kind of thing.14000:24:19.300 --> 00:24:26.709The Alliance: Yeah, I mean my, like, the more like this is I tell this story in flow for writers.14100:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.440The Alliance: So14200:24:30.120 --> 00:24:41.049The Alliance: my mentor, in writing my my grad school was a guy named John Barth, and John Barth is the godfather of metafiction, literally the most complicated fancy writing style known to man, and14300:24:41.050 --> 00:25:00.409The Alliance: I was a pension boy. I wanted to be Thomas Pension, the most complicated metafiction writer, and I remember my 1st meeting with with Barth, where he was like, Look dude! You've got the chops you can be. You're that good. I'll back like I believe in what you're doing. And and he really didn't say that to anybody else in the program, but he believed in me, he said, but you the most important that we're talking about pension.14400:25:00.410 --> 00:25:21.689The Alliance: And he was talking about gravity's rainbow, which is the craziest, sexiest, most. And he's like, Yeah, but he's like, do you know, remember that story about Byron, the light bulb which is this like short story about a light bulb in the middle of gravity's rainbow that contains all the major themes of the book. And it's written total. Normally, in plain English, the simplest like it's all the fancy storytelling goes out the window. It's like a kid's story in the middle of the book.14500:25:21.800 --> 00:25:40.489The Alliance: and Bart's point was like, You gotta have you got to be able to do all this stuff? You got all the pyrotechnics, but you also got to be able to tell the simple kids story when it's time to tell the readers what the book is about. You gotta have if you don't practice that, he said. If you're going to have a career, you can never have too many arrows in your quiver.14600:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.530The Alliance: and for me14700:25:44.690 --> 00:26:05.429The Alliance: I have had to write in every style man, I mean. I've written every now I'm a professional writer. So there's certain things that you're never gonna have to write a grant. I hope, or like certain some of the stuff that I've written along the way to make pay the bills. But, as far as like marketing copy goes, is like law like that stuff isn't gonna go away. And the14800:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.090The Alliance: because of chat Gbt.14900:26:08.990 --> 00:26:21.550The Alliance: the people who were shitty at it just got average. So if you're average, you gotta get good, because otherwise the shitty people are gonna out be because they're gonna do shit. You won't do.15000:26:22.100 --> 00:26:49.590The Alliance: They're not gonna have your ethics. They're not gonna have your standards. They're not gonna have your, they're gonna have. I can machine this because, like, that's why they never had the skills. In the 1st place, they were looking for the easy way they didn't have the skills. And now they got a machine that gives them the skills. And they don't have your ethics. So they're gonna do all that. They're gonna take the middle ground. You have to colonize. And you you gotta be higher ground now because you have to have more skills because the bottom moved up.15100:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.920Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I love that right.15200:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.090Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, that's man. That's a great way to put it.15300:26:54.240 --> 00:27:08.029Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: I know we only have a few minutes left, and I don't know if it's it's cause I haven't gone back to looking at. You know where we're going through all the months, and that that kind of thing. But the other thing I have a question with is just on protocols when it comes to energy management15400:27:08.110 --> 00:27:31.450Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: and flow right? So I've tried everything like living, the experimental lifestyle, and all that kind of thing. Right now I do as I talked about before, lots of heavy lifting, lots of strength workout and that kind of thing, my trainer is saying, hey, dude, you've hit the maximum you can get unless you put more protein into your body. It's over like you're. You've probably maxed out what you can do.15500:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.089Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So we need to get more protein and that kind of thing. But I'm curious if we're going to bring some of that in.15600:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.619Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: because I'm fascinating. By energy management, I mean.15700:27:41.780 --> 00:27:48.499Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: the outcomes are health and all that kind of thing. But man to keep going at this pace. You need a lot of energy.15800:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.900The Alliance: So15900:27:53.960 --> 00:28:05.919The Alliance: I eat. I only 3 meals a day, and I couple of my well, that's not true. I eat 4 meals a day, 3 small meals and one giant meal, basically. But that giant meal16000:28:05.920 --> 00:28:28.940The Alliance: is essentially like 2 and a half meals, because I is nothing like running a creative brain with regular access to flow is the most energy expensive thing you're gonna do. So you have to know that, like, you have to know that your brain is going to take way. More energy than your body like it is doing real hard, creative work. Writing16100:28:29.070 --> 00:28:50.364The Alliance: is more energy than going to the gym and getting a hard lift in, unless you're doing. Max lifts right, like, honest to God, it just is so. I think of it that way. If you want to get jiggy with it. I could tell you about the shot. It's expensive, and I don't have anything to do with it, but I literally like. So they it's an Rna shot that16200:28:51.090 --> 00:29:03.540The Alliance: It's the newest like. It's where all the crazy people are going. Ben Greenfield is the 1st one who told me about it. I've got friends who are investors in the company. My Buddy, Matt cook, is involved with it, but it literally lasts about a year and a half.16300:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.620The Alliance: It will odd16400:29:08.110 --> 00:29:21.980The Alliance: it does a lot of things, but it's really regenerative, but it will add about 10% strength to your body. People are seeing a 10% strength and muscle gain. And it basically turns on your 20 year old mitochondria again.16500:29:22.170 --> 00:29:34.300The Alliance: That's what it does. I haven't done it yet. I I like. I wait a little like it's been. People have been really good success for 2 years. I want to make sure there's no like16600:29:34.790 --> 00:29:41.900The Alliance: 4 or 5, right? I like. I've seen this stuff crash and burn, so I always wait. But like that, that's there. I16700:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.900The Alliance: the question I have for you with that like.16800:29:47.130 --> 00:29:55.279The Alliance: if your trainer is saying you're sort of like maxed out strength wise. Is that all your training like16900:29:55.420 --> 00:30:09.547The Alliance: I. So I train for skiing, so I want as much mass as I can get on my legs. But I also like yesterday, was really fucking fired up because I got my my 30 inch box jumps with.17000:30:09.960 --> 00:30:25.440The Alliance: I got it like up to 13 sets of 10, with 5 pounds in my hands. So now, I like once I like, I basically try to go like once I can get to 10 pounds in each hand. Then I'll go another 6 inches higher, because I believe I'll hit the platform. But I won't miss right.17100:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.219Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, start.17200:30:26.220 --> 00:30:36.639The Alliance: Got it right, because, you know, but like it goes so bad when you're up at a certain night, you're like, I don't know. And once you get above 30 inches, there's no more like it's not the pads anymore. Now, it's the fucking17300:30:36.840 --> 00:30:45.839The Alliance: metal thing. And I'm like, Okay, all right, this is big boy land, you know, and so but so I like, I always.17400:30:46.900 --> 00:31:09.000The Alliance: I mix in dynamic stuff. And then, you know, I like dynamic, weighted stuff, you know, Ryan and I do stuff or run downhills weight vests on because the best ski training you can get, you know, things like that. So the question be, you know, the question might be, you know, is it like, what's the goal like? Because if you really want to get to the problem with the maxing with the with more.17500:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.850The Alliance: If once you start to get.17600:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.830The Alliance: you can add 10 pounds of muscle17700:31:14.270 --> 00:31:21.859The Alliance: without having to radically change your diet, but once you get above like, it's really hard to do that meat well and be high. You know what I mean, like.17800:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.230Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yes.17900:31:22.230 --> 00:31:28.349The Alliance: I I can do it, but like it's very slow over time, and18000:31:29.450 --> 00:31:43.639The Alliance: you know I I have to fight in the opposite direction. If I'm not careful I'll go down to 135 pounds really quickly like if I'm not heavy lifting, and I'm just skiing hard and doing whatever I'll like, I'll lean.18100:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.120Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Just share.18200:31:44.120 --> 00:31:52.429The Alliance: Second. I've shed, you know, and I'm like I want. I'm trying to keep myself trying to get to 165, because I'll stop breaking bones if I can.18300:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.380Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, right.18400:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.390The Alliance: Help. Right?18500:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.720The Alliance: That's a really burly weight for me. But anyways, so that that other, how I think about it.18600:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.640Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: It's called the shot. Is that what.18700:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.910The Alliance: Oh, no, I mean, if you're really curious about it, I'll get you the. I can't remember the fucking name of it, but I can tell you I can get it for you.18800:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.250The Alliance: Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, I can't remember what the what it's called. I got it.18900:32:11.490 --> 00:32:23.456The Alliance: Text somebody but I'll I'll text you later if you're curious about it. Yeah, people are having really sort of ama, really amazing results with, I'm really sort of really excited about it.19000:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.919Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Yeah, I wanna do some research on that for sure.19100:32:27.250 --> 00:32:35.600The Alliance: I, you know, I my, my, I have to figure out how I'm gonna make a billion dollars. So I can fund the team. That's gonna make healthy spliffs that heal your lungs.19200:32:36.010 --> 00:32:36.420Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: So.19300:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.170The Alliance: That's see you19400:32:37.170 --> 00:32:46.019The Alliance: right. That's the like. That's that. That's that's part of like. When you give me a billion, then I can have. I have my pot. Friendly dog, friendly airline, too. No, kids19500:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.449The Alliance: weed dogs.19600:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.190Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Totally19700:32:49.960 --> 00:32:57.750Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: so that would. That was my lifelong thing as a kid, I'm like, why can't they get all the vitamins in the ice cream. I just I gotta eat ice cream all day.19800:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.750Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Okay.19900:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.670The Alliance: It's exactly true. It's exactly true. Alright20000:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.800Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: That's cool. Yeah, that aspect.20100:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.470The Alliance: I can't tell what time it is. Yeah, okay, cool.20200:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.430Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Clock. Okay.20300:33:08.430 --> 00:33:13.863The Alliance: I will. And do you have? I don't know you do. Did you get all the pop up dates? Have you seen those20400:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.580The Alliance: I.20500:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.120Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: No, I don't think so. Then, cause there's a bunch more. Yeah.20600:33:19.120 --> 00:33:30.960The Alliance: We're going to hood on. I think it's the 17th and 18.th Ryan is going to text everybody again this afternoon, probably put on the Whatsapp. So we're gonna go do it for anybody who wants to come skiing at the glacier.20700:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.874The Alliance: We'll be up there and then.20800:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.260The Alliance: August 11th Chicago. We're gonna go see Lincoln Park.20900:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.080Blair Lukan, CFP¨, CEPA¨, CEA¨: Oh, yeah, see, I didn't get that. So yeah, okay.21000:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.009The Alliance: Ticket if you want. If you want in on that, we're gonna get like21100:33:45.350 --> 00:33:54.689The Alliance: I've never been to the United Center, but like apparently section 112 is the best, not on the floor, but view of the stage from the like.21200:33:55.143 --> 00:34:15.419The Alliance: and with access to the floor. And I was like, Okay, we can. We found like 20 tickets in a row. So like we move fast, we just pick those up. But I think Ryan's gonna like names. Then we're gonna if for anybody wants.
