WEBVTT100:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.710The Alliance: You know, as soon as I hear it's vibe, you know, Steve, vibrato, we're gonna do one link, I justÉ200:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.150The Alliance: Hey, sir, how are ya?300:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.940James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Hello!400:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.310James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm doing okay.500:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920The Alliance: Cool!600:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.629James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You have a large collection of black hoodies.700:09:52.530 --> 00:10:00.129The Alliance: I haveÉ thisÉ 40 of them, I would say, 30 of them.800:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.040The Alliance: Yeah, I'veÉ I have that, but so you have, Jim, I haveÉ LikeÉ900:10:06.640 --> 00:10:19.609The Alliance: sweaters that are in maybe some other colors, and I have black hoodies, and then I have black shirts that go under my black jacket when I wear a suit. And that's, likeÉ1000:10:19.850 --> 00:10:28.249The Alliance: Like, that's it. I've got t-shirts. Other than that. I made a decision years ago that I was going to, É1100:10:28.370 --> 00:10:42.279The Alliance: pretty much take, like, hey, I, like, I like it better, but I was gonna simplify decision making, and I also find that when I wear all black, it solvesÉ1200:10:42.650 --> 00:10:59.469The Alliance: in the world, a bunch of problems for me that otherwiseÉ it's the same thing with the earring. These things solve problems for me, that, otherwise are, like, a pain in the ass to solve, but theyÉ they take care of it.1300:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.500The Alliance: Boom.1400:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You have a consistent brand, too, that's good.1500:11:04.210 --> 00:11:22.260The Alliance: I have a consistent brand, and like, if you see me in the airport with my hoodie, you know what I mean, and this on, and the eye scar, you don't tend to talk to me. I don't, right? You justÉ you tend to leave me alone. IÉ you know what I mean? I look very much like an old punk rocker.1600:11:22.340 --> 00:11:28.010The Alliance: and people, and I, like, I sort of really appreciate that,1700:11:28.150 --> 00:11:40.989The Alliance: And it also, like, when I'm working with clients, when I'm working with people who come in through, like, the real business world, they need, it's going to be very helpful to them to understand, like.1800:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.590The Alliance: I have a different background.1900:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.010The Alliance: Right, like, those things areÉ2000:11:46.570 --> 00:12:03.729The Alliance: I went for, like, a 10-year period where I was like, okay, I gotta play their game, right? Abundance had just come out, and I, like, I wore suits, you know what I mean, and sport coats, and IÉ and IÉ and I didÉ I did that, and I found that it actuallyÉ I don't think it helped me very much.2100:12:03.730 --> 00:12:14.869The Alliance: I was never myself, and it created more problems than it solved, you know what I mean? So, like, at a certain point when I was like, okay, I just could, likeÉ2200:12:14.870 --> 00:12:27.870The Alliance: fucking just be me. Everywhere I go, I'm just gonna be me no matter what, with, like, zero apology. And, we'll see how that goes. And I don't think it's hurt, I actually think it's helped.2300:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.900James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, yeah.2400:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.930The Alliance: you knowÉ.2500:12:30.680 --> 00:12:37.679James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, this sort of touches onÉ well, first of all, I really enjoyed the last expert call, or whatever.2600:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.439The Alliance: Thank you. That was so fucking magical, as far as I'm concerned.2700:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.820James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.2800:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.479The Alliance: Oh, was that cool?2900:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.960James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, andÉ3000:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.760James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, they obviously have a lot of deep experience in teams, and I've been thinking about team, like, sole performer versus team.3100:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.949James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I feel like I'm usually a pretty good sole performer, but then a team leader, I'm alwaysÉ3200:12:59.110 --> 00:13:06.109James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Less accomplished, andÉ One of the things that touches on, you know, punk rocker versus suit thing is.3300:13:06.480 --> 00:13:25.859James Crowe/Vanderbilt: we are in a really highly regulated situation. You know, federal laws about money, biosafety, chemicals, export control, IP. So we're, like, locking people down, and then we tell them, think completely out of the box, and come up with brand new science that's really innovative. So it's this, like, crushingÉ3400:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: regulation tightness.3500:13:29.550 --> 00:13:38.179James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And meanwhile, tell them to be intellectually free. And I feel like I myself can toggle back and forth. I don'tÉ I don't feel that.3600:13:38.620 --> 00:13:55.689James Crowe/Vanderbilt: difficulty, in fact, you know, fulfilling the catch-22 of regulatory things is like a game, it's like a puzzle. It's actually creative to fully fulfill regulatory stuff which can't be fulfilled and get on the other side of it. But most people, it's this contradictory thing, and I've notÉ3700:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.400James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, who do you hire for that, and then how do you.3800:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.430The Alliance: Oh, I know, I mean, soÉ3900:14:01.850 --> 00:14:11.499The Alliance: I can tell you who you hire in a funny way. I don't know the person, but I know the type. So, and it's literally, the reason I know this is you want a tax lawyer4000:14:11.900 --> 00:14:20.670The Alliance: for regulation, right? It's the same skill set as my brother. My brother was a taxÉ I mean, now he runs a law firm, but he was a tax lawyer. And, like.4100:14:20.750 --> 00:14:42.070The Alliance: when I was listening to you, I was like, God, he sounds like Brad talking about tax law back in the day, like, beforeÉ and, like, he bitches about it. He's like, I miss doing the, like, that was my flow, and now I gotta run all around the world, and, like, run meetings and blah blah blah, and I, like, I don't get toÉ yeah, it's really funny, that's the personality type you're looking for, right?4200:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.010James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. Bum.4300:14:43.440 --> 00:14:50.829The Alliance: You know, É So you're looking for somebody who can help you navig all that?4400:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.389James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, no, I'm sayingÉ4500:14:54.960 --> 00:15:12.029James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I think it's confusing to my team members, because we get them in a room and say, you have to follow all these rules, or we're gonna get in trouble, we're gonna get busted, I'm gonna go to jail. There's all this stuffÉ I mean, literally, I'm under gain-of-function inquiry right now, where people can go to jail. So there's that, and then we're saying, like.4600:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.130James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But we gotta invent new stuff that nobody ever thought about.4700:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: In science, É4800:15:18.630 --> 00:15:24.889James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I don't thinkÉ it's hard for them to switch, I don't know. You have more compliant people and more rebellious people.4900:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.830James Crowe/Vanderbilt: É.5000:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.280The Alliance: Yeah, so, to me.5100:15:33.030 --> 00:15:40.230The Alliance: One, that's very challenging, and I see it. The thing I think the rebellious people are missing, the thing that they don'tÉ5200:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.919The Alliance: they don't get it. It's hard to understand. You may never love this, butÉ5300:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.479The Alliance: Every creative career, and this is very much scientist, and this is also, like.5400:15:51.890 --> 00:15:59.430The Alliance: Any scienceÉ whatever your science career is, an astounding chunk of it5500:15:59.610 --> 00:16:15.080The Alliance: is spent navigating, like, weird-ass politics. Like, we justÉ you know, that Nature Pub thing that came out last week, ourÉ I don't know if you saw our Neurodynamics of Intuition paper came out last week, in Nature. I can send you a link. Have you seen it?5600:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.690James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I haven't read it, but I saw it came out.5700:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.220The Alliance: Okay.5800:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's a long road, I know.5900:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.760The Alliance: But up!6000:16:24.750 --> 00:16:42.009The Alliance: the fucking getting it just into nature tap dance, I nearly lost my mind. Even Manina was stressed. He was like, whoa, this isÉ like, this is bad for, like, for anything I've seen. I can't imagine what regulation is like. The thing that I always think about isÉ6100:16:45.250 --> 00:17:00.699The Alliance: creativity inside other people's lines, being forced to be creative inside somebody else's box, is the greatest skill set to learn for a career. Because if you can do that, and you already have the outside-the-box stuff.6200:17:00.700 --> 00:17:08.589James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah. You're great. And it reallyÉ and I honestly believe, not that this is gonna help with your team, but between you, me, and the wall.6300:17:08.880 --> 00:17:24.709The Alliance: you have to swallow your ego, and sort of go beginner's mind with it a little bit, and just, like, you know, the question is, how can you be the best version of yourself inside their box? Like, how do you express yourself the best that way? Yeah.6400:17:24.710 --> 00:17:41.840James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, I was remembering, like, a graph in ZTD, too, where you have the expansive open thing, and then you lock down, you execute for a while. And the executing, you gotta stay between the lines, and then the open-minded, you have to break the lines, so it'sÉ it's different phases of work, too, basically.6500:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.230The Alliance: Yeah, I mean, I, likeÉ6600:17:43.360 --> 00:17:57.869The Alliance: that's the phase of everything, right? You have to, likeÉ iteration is wildly open, build phase is really tight, iterÉ you knowÉ I justÉ if you haven't read it, you'll really enjoy it. Tony Fidel's book, Build.6700:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.940James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I haven't, yeah.6800:17:59.940 --> 00:18:22.239The Alliance: It'sÉ it's, É I wannaÉ I would definitely put it up there with the best business books I've ever read. It's the first business book I've read where, like, the guy talks like me, and thinks like me, and is reallyÉ he's not a science guy, but he's very fucking practical, and he goes through, like, everything on entrepreneurship. He learnedÉ you know who he is? He's the guy who builtÉ designedÉ he designed the iPod, he built Nest.6900:18:22.260 --> 00:18:33.669The Alliance: He's doneÉ he's like the designer, designer, designer. Was it Apple? Was it Magic? Whatever the fuck that first Andy Catsfield's thing, É7000:18:33.790 --> 00:18:47.360The Alliance: God, I can't remember if before or after Apple. Anyways, he's a tech genius. Now he's aÉ now he's a VC, but his build is a greatÉ like, he had good advice on Teams, he had good advice sort of across the boards on, like.7100:18:47.370 --> 00:19:06.499The Alliance: every sort of little detail. I was like, this is a really good playbook. This is very, like, for playbook for entrepreneurship, I sort ofÉ I was like, if you couple this with, like, the update to Bold that I'd like to write, you'd almost have the, like, you'd almost have a pretty damn good operating manual.7200:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.720James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Okay.7300:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.200James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So I want to also, like, connect back to previous meetings that we had, soÉ.7400:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.569The Alliance: Yeah, what can I help you with? What's big? What's first on your mind? What's foremost? What are we gonna do?7500:19:18.570 --> 00:19:28.050James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, IÉ you know, I've said, like, twice, I've been kind of in crisis mode, because the U.S. government went nuts around infectious disease, andÉ7600:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.510James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm theÉ just at NIH, I'm the 15th ofÉ7700:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.870James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm number 15 on the list of 45,000 investigators in terms of money. So, like.7800:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.520James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Stuff's happening toward me right now. You know, just the scale of it.7900:19:44.650 --> 00:19:52.069James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And being targeted for, you know, various crazy things. So work's been crazy, and thenÉ8000:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.119James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, my wife is reassessing whether she wants to live with me. This started, you know.8100:19:57.580 --> 00:20:06.120James Crowe/Vanderbilt: 6 months ago, and so we got into some really intensive marriage therapy, and it's going well, but I mean, it takes a lot of attention.8200:20:06.400 --> 00:20:15.440James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And discussion, not just during the therapy, but daily, andÉ you know, some other stuff. So, youÉ8300:20:15.790 --> 00:20:24.600James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you were asking me about my clear goals, which, okay, were 50 clear goals, but they were supposed to be 8 to 12, and you told me, no, 3. So I literally did that.8400:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.729James Crowe/Vanderbilt: in the last, maybe, 2 or 3 months, I'm just like, what is the one thing I gottaÉ8500:20:30.930 --> 00:20:36.250James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Hellbent, get done today to make sure people get paid and nothing bad happens.8600:20:36.650 --> 00:20:44.969James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, to some extent, I've only been doing things like that, except I finish them, and I finish them in a really short time frame.8700:20:45.490 --> 00:20:52.609James Crowe/Vanderbilt: because I'm only doing one to three things, I'm like, I might as well just get it done today, rather than string it out.8800:20:53.010 --> 00:20:59.400James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So I've actually shifted over this time to a whole new way of working, where I'm doing very little8900:21:00.210 --> 00:21:11.299James Crowe/Vanderbilt: riff-raff, or if I do stuffÉ I mean, I do have, like, 50 to 100 buttons every day I gotta push, approve this, budget that, but, like, I'm not even thinking about it. I'm just like, click, click, click, click, click, get this done.9000:21:11.460 --> 00:21:19.919James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I'm trusting my people, you know, to not send me to jail, and I'm only spinning my brain on the 1 to 3,9100:21:20.060 --> 00:21:29.449James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I sort of feel like it's going great. Like, I've turned in a number of really difficult grants, andÉ9200:21:29.960 --> 00:21:37.600James Crowe/Vanderbilt: finishing papers, like, only my highest payoff stuff, that's all I'm doing. And I'm paying attention to my wife, and I'mÉ9300:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.669James Crowe/Vanderbilt: running a lot, because I have a race coming up. So, I've sort of purified it down.9400:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.799James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I just don't know, like, is this gonna bite me?9500:21:47.610 --> 00:21:56.269James Crowe/Vanderbilt: because, like, I'm not paying attention to details, or did I shift into a new mode, and people are seeing, okay, this is a new gym, we gotta take care of these details.9600:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.760James Crowe/Vanderbilt: If it's a new mode, I like it.9700:21:59.760 --> 00:22:09.060The Alliance: Yeah, and so, let me, let me, let me, that's awesome. Like, that is so much value out of theÉ like, I, like.9800:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.369The Alliance: IÉ in a weird way, myÉ let meÉ you look a hell of a lot happier.9900:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.409James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, you look happy.10000:22:16.890 --> 00:22:17.290James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.10100:22:17.290 --> 00:22:30.840The Alliance: Like, you're literally, like, there's glowy rather than, like, angst. And É I also thinkÉ likeÉ10200:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.019The Alliance: Flat truth, unless you want to get divorced.10300:22:35.150 --> 00:22:54.089The Alliance: Your health, it's gonna be priority one, and your marriage is gonna be priority two. It sort of has to be that way, and when those things go into crisis, you're like, oh, fuck, IÉ like, I gotta really pay attention to this, because it gets so complicated if this goes away, and everything explodes.10400:22:54.090 --> 00:23:05.279The Alliance: So, like, I think that's a great, like, I think that's always a great priority. I also think learning to trust your team is fantastic. That sounds tremendous. I, É10500:23:08.700 --> 00:23:17.729The Alliance: would tell youÉ the only thing I would tell you is, É Make sure they are, like.10600:23:17.910 --> 00:23:38.150The Alliance: have the meeting where you make sure everybody who's tracking the day-to-day is also keeping their eye on the long-term goals, because when people get really focused short-term, they miss someÉ like, are they checking the long-term goal boxes or just the short-term goal boxes, right? Because often, when you take away supervision one or the other.10700:23:38.150 --> 00:23:49.340The Alliance: is where they focus on, and they start seeing the short-term stuff, and not as much long-term, so I like toÉ that I've noticed, I like to checkÉ have check-ins on that, andÉ10800:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.780The Alliance: Like, and something, some kind ofÉ10900:23:58.260 --> 00:24:15.680The Alliance: I wouldÉ I, like, I don't know how to do it, I would build an AI agent for it if I were gonna do this, but IÉ some way to verify their stuff, that are you gonna go toÉ like, you shouldn't have to ask me the question, should I trust my team, am I gonna go to jail? That's too high of a cost.11000:24:15.680 --> 00:24:26.760The Alliance: You don't want that to break, right? That one can't break, but I love not micromanaging and trusting your team, but you need that. The only thing I would say is, like, what kind of, like.11100:24:26.900 --> 00:24:41.290The Alliance: check-in would you need, or what kind of information would you need to feel like they had thatÉ they had your back, and you would notice if they were slipping? Because that's the one thing you want toÉ like, everything else, É11200:24:41.290 --> 00:24:56.759The Alliance: IÉ you know, I think what you're gonna find, it's what I found when IÉ when I did what you did, and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna focus. I could do, you know, 4 things in a day, basically, and that's, like, you know.11300:24:56.810 --> 00:25:11.070The Alliance: and then the busyÉ and then some of the busy work, and then my fitness and my marriage, and that's, like, that's what I got, right? And, I mean, one of the things is my bookings can take 4 hours, and then, you know, and then I've got other stuff. É11400:25:11.210 --> 00:25:18.749The Alliance: But that's how IÉ I've always thought of it. Once I did that, I found that you get more done. And theÉ and whatÉ11500:25:18.860 --> 00:25:32.899The Alliance: when you'llÉ so here, Jim, hereÉ here's howÉ here's my answer to your question, actually. It took me a while to get there, I'm sorry. I don't have to hang up at 3.30, by the way, hard, so I can keep going a little bit. But É11600:25:35.830 --> 00:25:43.100The Alliance: IÉ so I call itÉ I think of it as the Habit of Ferocity, which is a class I taught through Mindvalley, and the ideaÉ I always say to youÉ11700:25:44.070 --> 00:25:50.089The Alliance: Know you're there when you, like, 6 months have passed, and you look back, and you think.11800:25:50.140 --> 00:26:00.749The Alliance: oh wow, what have I accomplished in the past 6 months? And you list all the big projects that are done, and the list sort of blows your mind, and you're like, that doesn't make any sense, how do I do all that?11900:26:00.750 --> 00:26:21.060The Alliance: That's when you know you're sort of there. Sounds like you're moving in that direction to me, like you're getting the reallyÉ you get the really, really big stuff done, and then the little stuff doesn't weigh as much. You've got so much cognitive RAM cleared up, you fly through it, and you end up getting much more done in less time with a lot less insanity.12000:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.359The Alliance: But, you have to trust your team. Now.12100:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.549The Alliance: like, I did that at the Flow Research Collective, and it worked for the first 3 years.12200:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.729The Alliance: And then, in years 4 and 5, it didn't work.12300:26:39.900 --> 00:26:46.179The Alliance: Because my CEO wanted to become his own rising star, and stopped12400:26:46.350 --> 00:27:09.570The Alliance: running my long-term projects and started, you know, doing his own stuff, and, without talking to you. I was like, I would have beenÉ we could have, you know what I mean? Like, I would have been fine with it, and I helped him. I like to help the people I mentor, you know what I mean? I'm not mad at it, but, like, it sort of wobbled the company, and it didn't have to if you would have talked to me about, you know what I mean?12500:27:09.570 --> 00:27:17.170The Alliance: That'sÉ so, like, Even really good people, if their motivations change, that's when stuffÉ12600:27:17.350 --> 00:27:23.219The Alliance: starts to wobble and break, and you have to be careful, right? So thatÉ if that's my answer.12700:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.340James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I have a little bit of that going on, because I haveÉ12800:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.499James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Junior people, and there's not an amazing job12900:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Market right now for assistant professors to go out.13000:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.089James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So I have some people whoÉ13100:27:38.190 --> 00:27:45.059James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Historically would have been, and they stayed in my group because there's a lot of money and projects, and there's not independent jobs for them.13200:27:45.160 --> 00:28:02.309James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But they kind of wish they were running the show, and there's sort of credit, and I'm trying to think through that, because I can feel like they want the credit for being the man, and at some point, I want to promote them, but it's like, yeah, but you're one of the lieutenants here. There's actuallyÉ13300:28:02.460 --> 00:28:09.120James Crowe/Vanderbilt: IÉ ultimately, I need some credit, because I'm the one who then turns that into money to get grants to do more work.13400:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.520James Crowe/Vanderbilt: SoÉ.13500:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.129The Alliance: Do you have that conversation transparently with them?13600:28:14.130 --> 00:28:24.369James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, one of them in particular, I was like, so get your own thing, you know, andÉ and the person is locked in because of ailing parents, andÉ13700:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.760James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you know, needs to stay in Nashville, and there's no biotech in Nashville, soÉ13800:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.590James Crowe/Vanderbilt: She, you know, and I've tried to say, like, that's kind of not my problem.13900:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.170James Crowe/Vanderbilt: you knowÉ you can't say, well, I can't leave because, you know, I have personal reasons.14000:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.859James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I want to be the boss, but you can't be the boss.14100:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.360The Alliance: SoÉ É I wouldÉ so, likeÉ14200:28:49.750 --> 00:28:56.159The Alliance: This is the point at which I gave Ryan company funding to start his YouTube channel.14300:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.280James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Huh.14400:28:57.660 --> 00:29:03.349The Alliance: Right? And, like, that'sÉ like, whenÉ when that stuff started to happen, I was like, okay.14500:29:03.410 --> 00:29:13.249The Alliance: Cool, you don't get to be the boss, I'm the boss. This is the Flower Research Collective, and I own the majority of shares. I'm the boss, and I have 30 years here.14600:29:13.250 --> 00:29:28.169The Alliance: you're very good, let's build you up, but it's gonna beÉ YouTube will do it as an FRC, we endorse YouTube, and that sort of stuff, as a place to start. And Rhian built a giant YouTube, 300,000É 50,000 fans, so it worked.14700:29:28.170 --> 00:29:34.710The Alliance: Like, it worked for him. In the end, É it, É14800:29:36.060 --> 00:29:44.349The Alliance: And I think it workedÉ it workedÉ it worked out. ItÉ where it slowed down is, like, my long-term projects never got done. So, like.14900:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.879The Alliance: You know, I, I don'tÉ oh, I haven'tÉ15000:29:49.300 --> 00:30:02.500The Alliance: I canÉ so when we're done, I'll text you. I'm starting, my giant project onÉ with PTSD, depression, and, worker reskilling, and, what's it called?15100:30:02.500 --> 00:30:10.520The Alliance: addiction, right? And we're starting to go for government grants, and get funding, and do all that stuff, and É15200:30:10.770 --> 00:30:16.270The Alliance: One of the things we have to do is rebuild Z2D for the common man, and it should have been fucking done years ago.15300:30:16.500 --> 00:30:31.009The Alliance: Like, it should'veÉ like, my whole, like, let's keep rebuilding Z2D, like, I had to shut down our company so I can, like, go through the data and rebuild the core training, because it hasn't been updated since 2018, and it's really not current.15400:30:31.290 --> 00:30:31.880James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yep.15500:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.790The Alliance: And so many.15600:30:32.790 --> 00:30:38.490James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I would so loveÉ there's so many people on my team, I feel like, oh god, they should do CTD.15700:30:39.110 --> 00:30:46.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: like, I was already pretty good at that stuff, and maybe, you know, upped my game, but then I thought, I need to teach my people, they don't know the basics of this stuff.15800:30:46.970 --> 00:30:59.400The Alliance: Well, I thinkÉ so, Jim, here's what I think you should do on that front, is, É and we haven't, likeÉ there's gotta be some kind of discount pricing I'll figure out for, for, like, alliance members around this stuff, but, likeÉ15900:30:59.520 --> 00:31:10.119The Alliance: I do a 3-hour workshop. It's the workshop that I did at Google, it's the, likeÉ the thing is with Z2D is, I was like, you can go through the whole thing.16000:31:10.360 --> 00:31:18.339The Alliance: Right? And somebody will hold your hand, you know, all the coaches, but as a general rule, if the boss has been trained thoroughly.16100:31:18.340 --> 00:31:18.730James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.16200:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.150The Alliance: I can do a 3-hour workshop.16300:31:21.150 --> 00:31:42.499The Alliance: Because you know enough to talk to them about distraction management and recovery, and really, like, you, like, IÉ like, the same steering a coach is going to provide, because none of this shit is hard, you can sort of provide, and it'llÉ one, if you're leading by example, and, like, living this stuff, and you so do, you know what I mean, in the various things you do. And I, by the way.16400:31:42.720 --> 00:31:54.040The Alliance: I'm really fucking proud of you, like, for what you've done with your marriage. Like, that, likeÉ I'm proud of what you do for a living, like, it's cool, you have a great job, I'm reallyÉ16500:31:54.040 --> 00:32:02.919The Alliance: It's been an honor to sort of help you do it better, but, like, the fact that you, that was your priority,16600:32:03.000 --> 00:32:14.799The Alliance: and you never stop trading along the way, also, is what I, like, I was just like, okay, that's, like, my book, that's super badass. Those are the things that, like, people fuck this shit up all the time.16700:32:14.800 --> 00:32:27.740The Alliance: You didn't fuck any of it up. And when you came in, I was like, oh shit, Jim Crow is a hot mess. I don't know if we're gonna be able to help him. And it, like, Jim Crow's not a hot mess right now.16800:32:27.740 --> 00:32:34.959The Alliance: There's, like, things that you gotta, like, boxes you gotta check so your ass is covered, you know what I mean? But, likeÉ16900:32:35.220 --> 00:32:52.309The Alliance: Boom. IÉ and by the way, that's myÉ that's what I would say, is I would do, like, a 3-month review of, like, the projects you'veÉ you've gotÉ you've accomplished, andÉ and think about what that means, and then, like, literally, like, go back, compare it to a year ago, and what you did in a 3-month period, see if you'veÉ17000:32:52.310 --> 00:33:03.109The Alliance: you know, or start trackÉ I track my life and how many projects I do. It's too hard to track in terms of any otherÉ any other thing, because some of them, you know what I mean, they're all giant.17100:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.260The Alliance: And, É.17200:33:04.720 --> 00:33:19.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So I don'tÉ I don't know if you heard at the end, the last question I asked the Google lady, like, aboutÉ has to do with satisfaction and dissatisfaction. So I feel like a lot of the good energy that I inject into my group is dissatisfaction.17300:33:20.290 --> 00:33:31.850James Crowe/Vanderbilt: and urgency. Like, come on, we can do better, we can do faster. And the problem is, like, we'll accomplish a goal, and I'll be like, I'll get up the next morning, I'm like, more, faster.17400:33:31.960 --> 00:33:38.229James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And, like, they want to have, you know, donuts and coffee to celebrate we hit the goal, and I don'tÉ.17500:33:38.640 --> 00:33:49.640The Alliance: Oh, alright, so that's easy. No, no, it's easy. This one, this oneÉ Like, I don't feel the satisfaction I want more. No, no, I underÉ I underÉ yeah, yeah, so IÉ I get this one.17600:33:49.740 --> 00:34:08.590The Alliance: I learned this one from Anthony Randall. He taught me this one. So Anthony Randall, a friend of mine who does, like, I toldÉ I mentioned him at some point to you, I think. If you'reÉ if you're U2, and you want to go on tour, you're Beyonce, and you want to go on tour, or you want to throw a Super Bowl halftime show, he's the guy you hire to do it.17700:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.209The Alliance: That's what he does, right? That's likeÉ so he is used to managing teams of, like.17800:34:14.239 --> 00:34:33.869The Alliance: 10,000 who come together for 3 months to take you two on tour, and it's like, you know, it's a $50 million set that they're moving and rehanging every day, and it weighs 74,000 tons, like, it's the fucking craziest shit you've ever seen. Anyways, É17900:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.230The Alliance: What was your question?18000:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.460James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Getting dissatisfied.18100:34:38.460 --> 00:35:00.259The Alliance: What is satisfaction? Yeah, he told me this one. He said a couple of things, because I said, what do you do? Because he's on a tight thing, and that was like, if you guys don't sell aÉ he's like, no, no. He's like, first of all, it's a rookie, though, so they sort of party hard, they sort of take care of the celebration themselves, so some of this is less me, but the thing he said is, when it comes to milestone.18200:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.649The Alliance: People want their work celebrated.18300:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.280The Alliance: But you can level set.18400:35:08.410 --> 00:35:20.680The Alliance: to what you celebrate. So, in other words, they think every victory is a celebration. That's not your checklist. Your checklist is like, no, when we get 10 things, 20 things done.18500:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.120The Alliance: then, like, yay! Right? So what you have to figure out is where they are.18600:35:26.120 --> 00:35:48.249The Alliance: where you are, pick a midpoint, you know what I mean? You compromise, they compromise, and you're gonnaÉ and at that point, what you do is you bring everybody together to celebrate the wins, and you do something a little sort of extra around the celebration, or whatever. And, É18700:35:52.670 --> 00:36:04.170The Alliance: Yeah, I, like, I think that, like, I think you could reframe it, and like, hey, say, you know what, I've noticed this is a problem, and it's not that I don't celebrate your wins, I loveÉ I fucking love them, but thatÉ18800:36:04.170 --> 00:36:24.120The Alliance: I see theÉ I see the large scale of things and how much is left to do, and so I can'tÉ I actually can't stop and celebrate every win. My calendar is to, like, you know, every 20 wins, then I declare it a victory, but, like, that doesn't seem fair to you guys either, because that's my calendar, so can we meet in the middle, right?18900:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.050James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yep.19000:36:26.170 --> 00:36:31.789James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, well, I know very specifically, because I've sat with my leadership team and made a quad chart ofÉ19100:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.500James Crowe/Vanderbilt: four things that are, like, my goals, so we're trying to getÉ19200:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.839James Crowe/Vanderbilt: 40 papers peer-reviewed out a year, plus, you know, I write, like, 30 chapters.19300:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.880The Alliance: Let me ask you a question. Is that visualized on a wall that everybody can see every time they come in?19400:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.060James Crowe/Vanderbilt: No, it's not.19500:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.190The Alliance: Yeah.19600:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.680James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Company's doing that, yeah.19700:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.680The Alliance: Get it? Get it? Like, I don't know if you can gamify it, because, like.19800:36:55.020 --> 00:37:02.820The Alliance: Scientists are weird and competitive and strange, and like, that might go horribly wrong, but, É19900:37:02.890 --> 00:37:27.250The Alliance: this is somethingÉ but Tony Fidel talked about it in his book a little bit, and I've talked about it, when everybody shares the same story, right? That's culture building, right? All those fourÉ you have to take those 40 projects, they have to be a story. You have to be able to tell the story to the team, and then give them a visual, this is where we are on the story. That way, when you say we're going to celebrate when we get to this point on the20000:37:27.250 --> 00:37:34.410The Alliance: Matt, this is the point. You know, this is halfway, then we're gonna fucking get really drunk on GERD bourbon that I'm buying.20100:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.459The Alliance: And who wants a hooker?20200:37:37.670 --> 00:37:43.870James Crowe/Vanderbilt: We don't do that at our university, but okay. It's been done, it didn't goÉ.20300:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.740The Alliance: I haven'tÉ.20400:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.280James Crowe/Vanderbilt: IÉ heÉ.20500:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.190The Alliance: the other timeÉ I said, oh god, this was funny.20600:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.269The Alliance: Went to seeÉ you should have come, by the way, Pennywise and Sublime.20700:37:56.870 --> 00:38:08.790The Alliance: was fucking dope. Pennywise was dope. Dope. If you're an old punk guy, that guy's 60-whatever, and he can still sing faster than, likeÉ20800:38:08.790 --> 00:38:28.100The Alliance: he was singing faster than, like, anybody but, like, dancehall rappers. I was like, I don't know how he's movingÉ we couldn't sing along. We wereÉ I know all the words, and half the time, Brian and I, we could not sing along, and I was like, this is really weird. I was like, I've never had this happen before, I don't know, I'm out of breath, I can't keep up, and É20900:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.999The Alliance: É I don't know why I was telling you that.21000:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.769The Alliance: There was a reference, but anyways, É.21100:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.280James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I, É yeah, IÉ21200:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.600James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I had, you know, you sort of pegged me early on, I like novelty, so I was atÉ.21300:38:43.610 --> 00:38:48.110The Alliance: World Mummy Studies Conference, that's why I couldn't go, in Cuscos, Peru.21400:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.729The Alliance: You told me that.21500:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.930James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Machu Picchu, where I'd worked as a college student for 6 weeks. This is an amazing experience.21600:38:55.300 --> 00:39:01.389James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, I had aÉ it's part of why I'm feeling good right now. I just went to South America for 10 days.21700:39:03.180 --> 00:39:11.540James Crowe/Vanderbilt: ButÉ You know, sort of toggling into work and toggling out to other interests also helps me a lot.21800:39:11.910 --> 00:39:23.570James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And, you know, it's a little more macro scale of theÉ it's aÉ I mean, you've been teaching us microdosing, like, that's like macrodosing. I spent 10 days in South America hiking andÉ21900:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.299James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, all that. And then I came right back into work.22000:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.450James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And I feel like I'm doing a good job because of it, IÉ So,22100:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.650The Alliance: But, Jim, like, I thinkÉ22200:39:37.970 --> 00:39:46.469The Alliance: skiing doesÉ skiing is a complete reset for me, so I don't have to do this during ski season. But when I'm not in ski season.22300:39:46.620 --> 00:40:06.079The Alliance: every 9 weeks, I have to do what you just did. It doesn't evenÉ for me, it was like, I did it yesterday, we took the Alliance, everybody went to the show Saturday night, and then I just stayed in Vegas. I didn'tÉ I caught the last flight out yesterday, and I stayed in Vegas, and I just sat in a, like, in a park.22400:40:06.090 --> 00:40:20.789The Alliance: smoked cigarettes, and read books. And, like, let myÉ like, and not books related to anything I'm doing, and not novels, like, just, like, just fed my brain some shit, some new shit, É22500:40:21.600 --> 00:40:21.950The Alliance: Yeah.22600:40:21.950 --> 00:40:26.750James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I'm doing the same thing, soÉ I'm reading Muhammad Ali's biography. Oh my god.22700:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.150The Alliance: How is it?22800:40:28.390 --> 00:40:34.520James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's amazing, the guyÉ I don't know, I just relate to some of it. Like, when he wasÉ22900:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.749James Crowe/Vanderbilt: 13 or 14, he said, I will be the heavyweight champion of the world.23000:40:39.590 --> 00:40:47.459James Crowe/Vanderbilt: at 13 or 14, like, the assurance, like, I am going to do this, and you are not going to stop me.23100:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.110The Alliance: So I have to tell you something very funny, and this may change your reading pattern, but IÉ soÉ23200:40:56.660 --> 00:41:09.509The Alliance: there was a period in my life when I got pretty far away from action sports. When I was living in New Mexico, I wasn't as deeply connected to the community. The community there wasÉ there's a hardcore community there, but they're notÉ23300:41:09.910 --> 00:41:15.170The Alliance: They're connected to the mountain bike scene, sort of, and beyond that, they don't, like, they're just notÉ23400:41:15.170 --> 00:41:31.690The Alliance: one pro athlete has come out of Taos ever. They're just, likeÉ I always say that, like, it's sort of like the Gas Humper Olympics. They're sort of likeÉ they're really hardcore mountain people, and they don't give a fuck, and they're not interested in the rest of the world. So, I was disconnected from it, and IÉ23500:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.810The Alliance: remember when I was, like.23600:41:34.170 --> 00:41:41.589The Alliance: trying to, like, build my career up, I started reading, when IÉ before Rise of Superman, I was like, oh, I'm gonna go back and read a bunch ofÉ23700:41:41.720 --> 00:41:49.660The Alliance: action sports biographies to sort of prep for that. And I remember I started with Rodney Mullen's autobiography, Mutt.23800:41:49.710 --> 00:42:05.249The Alliance: And the skater, who's a sort of idiot savant, like, genius, he's also a genius, he's working at MIT right now, trying to, like, figure out what he does on a skateboard, you know. They're doing cool stuff, but É he, É I'm reading it, and I was like, oh my god, this dude thinks like me.23900:42:05.850 --> 00:42:11.139James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Not, likeÉ and he's got my same competitiveness, and the same, likeÉ.24000:42:11.140 --> 00:42:26.660The Alliance: MyÉ I was like, that's interesting, and I read a different action sports biography by another top Evely, and I was like, oh shit, it's the same psychology, and I was like, I'm wired more like a top athlete for writing than I am a writer.24100:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.309The Alliance: And IÉ24200:42:29.670 --> 00:42:38.839The Alliance: itÉ IÉ I readÉ I readÉ I like Athlet, I likeÉ I like those biographies, because I'm like, I sort of understand the mindset. If you want to be best in the world.24300:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.780The Alliance: and you're just that obsessive, well, you're speaking my language, I get that.24400:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.320James Crowe/Vanderbilt: True.24500:42:45.310 --> 00:42:49.840James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, maybe not even competitive, you just want to be good for yourself, orÉ24600:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.590James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I mean, itÉ it is comparative, but it's notÉ Essential.24700:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.069The Alliance: Oh, IÉ when I say I'm usually competitive with myself.24800:42:57.070 --> 00:42:57.670James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.24900:42:57.670 --> 00:43:09.579The Alliance: I don't really compete against other people that much, though I will tell you that, like, I'm fiercely competitive, you know what I mean? Like, I do want to be the best. I walk into a room full of writers, I want to be the best.25000:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yo.25100:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.420The Alliance: Or I want to be friends with the best.25200:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.300James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You got friends in high places.25300:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.290James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Correct.25400:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.350James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, so I think that'sÉ.25500:43:25.310 --> 00:43:25.890The Alliance: What else?25600:43:25.890 --> 00:43:26.470James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Hmm.25700:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.430The Alliance: What's next?25800:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.360James Crowe/Vanderbilt: É25900:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.350James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, I'm taking myÉ I'm only dropping in my job to do my laundry and check in on things. I'm taking my wife to Italy, we're hiking dolomites.26000:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.250James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Starting Sunday.26100:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.699James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, É it's kind of dual, like, I'll beÉ26200:43:47.830 --> 00:43:52.210James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Exercising in nature, and 100% paying attention to my wife.26300:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.820James Crowe/Vanderbilt: come back, write a bunch of stuff, turn it in, and then IÉ26400:43:57.060 --> 00:44:07.569James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I have a 250K race in Greece I'm scheduled for, so I'mÉ I'm, like, doing rapid toggling, only working a week at a time, but it'sÉ it's actuallyÉ26500:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.939James Crowe/Vanderbilt: You know, the one to three things?26600:44:10.150 --> 00:44:18.600James Crowe/Vanderbilt: idea. Like, if I'm only here for a week and I gotta get the big thing done, it's actually sort ofÉ it's a restraint, you know? It's a helpful restraint.26700:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.179James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Because I'm good at just-in-time and deadlines, it helps me.26800:44:23.510 --> 00:44:29.839James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So that's my next few months. So I'm gonna go, you know, to your end thing, and fly from there to Greece and do the race.26900:44:30.100 --> 00:44:36.020James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And then I'll start overÉ I don't have a vision longer than that, butÉ É27000:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.520James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's been a really great summer, and É27100:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.759James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, I've done well at work, and my marriage is good, andÉ27200:44:44.290 --> 00:44:50.970James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Even my kids are good. Like, we spent a lot of time with them. Well, talking with them. My daughter just got engaged.27300:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.090James Crowe/Vanderbilt: just for today, it's pretty amazing, and IÉ I do feel like27400:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.260James Crowe/Vanderbilt: The crisis and switching to just a fewÉ27500:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.120James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Things at work has been sort of the secrets.27600:45:06.730 --> 00:45:19.919The Alliance: Do you remember at the start of the class, I said, you guys are gonna feel like I'm disappointing you with this, but my real goal is that 6 months from now, you look back and you're like, okay, I doÉ27700:45:21.000 --> 00:45:37.530The Alliance: two new things, I stop doing two things, and I do two things differently, and you're gonna get, like, a 10-20% lift out of that. That's sortÉ like, this is what that looks like. You just got there fast, in a sense. That's what itÉ likeÉ27800:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.289The Alliance: I really, I really, you know, I think that's whatÉ27900:45:42.370 --> 00:45:59.829The Alliance: a couple of well-applied tools, because peopleÉ you gottaÉ you're doing most of this shit anyways, you can't get to the top without it, so it's really a question of what are you doing wrong, what can we fix, you know what I mean? Like, when you actually do that stuff, you stop doing a couple of things.28000:45:59.830 --> 00:46:08.639The Alliance: you started doing a couple of things, you do a couple things differently. In your case, it's maybe a little bit more than a couple, but that, likeÉ but the lift is huge.28100:46:08.750 --> 00:46:15.919The Alliance: And the better news is it feels like, at least on my end, I don't want to speak for you, but it seems sustainable.28200:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.250James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.28300:46:17.870 --> 00:46:23.550James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I think so, IÉ I do need to think about what you're saying, how do I check in, andÉ28400:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.849James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Spot check and make sureÉ Stuff's okay, butÉ28500:46:29.050 --> 00:46:34.619James Crowe/Vanderbilt: We're hitting high goals right now in a very adverseÉ Environment, too, likeÉ28600:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.659James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Actually, IÉ I have this weird, É28700:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.239James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I don't know, it's like you talk about gamifying. I gamified the whole grant, andÉ28800:46:46.420 --> 00:47:01.359James Crowe/Vanderbilt: political thing for myself over the years. I always think the harder and stupider these grant applications, the longer it takes to get a nature paper published, the better for me, because a lot of people are going to give up, because it's dumb, and it's notÉ28900:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.740James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It doesn't make sense, and it's frustrating.29000:47:03.870 --> 00:47:07.319James Crowe/Vanderbilt: But if you sort of think, oh, I want to be on the other side of all that.29100:47:07.730 --> 00:47:15.469James Crowe/Vanderbilt: then you will do it, and the current environment for infectious disease research right now is terrible. I mean, RFK is justÉ29200:47:15.900 --> 00:47:29.449James Crowe/Vanderbilt: is just decimating the thing, and what I'm telling my team is like, yeah, but we're getting hurt a little bit, but if we can see beyond this, we're gonna be the only people left standing in our space, and we almost are for29300:47:29.470 --> 00:47:36.289James Crowe/Vanderbilt: United States military, we're almost sole source for making human antibodies for emerging infections.29400:47:36.390 --> 00:47:41.039James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Almost nobody else. So the fact that it's adverse is good for us.29500:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.440The Alliance: Cause we're gonna survive it, and IÉ Yeah, Jim, IÉ soÉ29600:47:45.460 --> 00:48:00.129The Alliance: That's funny. This isÉ I said thisÉ we went throughÉ this is where the Flow Research Collective went away, and I'm still okay with it, because I said, look, everyone became a coach during COVID. The whole world became a coach.29700:48:00.130 --> 00:48:15.949The Alliance: everybody. And you can no longer tell who's good, who's bad, who's real, who's fake. There's gonna be a hugeÉ there's gonna be a recession. It's coming. There'sÉ right? Everything's gonna go away. And it happened, right? Like.29800:48:15.950 --> 00:48:34.360The Alliance: the coaching industry, top to bottom, isÉ was down, like, it's still down, like, 50É it's 50% of what it was at the end of COVID, maybe less at this point. And it's top to bottom. It's, like, myself, Tony Robbins, like, everybody'sÉ like, everybody'sÉ all the way to theÉ most of theÉ butÉ29900:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.899The Alliance: What's happening now is, because obviously people need training.30000:48:38.910 --> 00:48:58.599The Alliance: Right? That doesn't change. And so, there's, you know, the shitty coaches are becoming AI coaches now, like, that's the new market, so they're, like, the people who failed at life coaching or whatever, they're AI coaches now, which is great for me, because, like, they're moving out of the peak performance space, in a sense.30100:49:00.230 --> 00:49:11.290The Alliance: I'm ha- like, it sucked, and itÉ and, you know, it hurt my income for a couple of years, but as we're coming a little bit out of that.30200:49:11.730 --> 00:49:18.269The Alliance: there's 50% of the competition is gone, and a bunch of the nonsense is gone, right? So, likeÉ30300:49:18.810 --> 00:49:30.619The Alliance: I, you know, and the people who are left, I also, like, it was gross being in a field with all these, likeÉ you know, I do applied performance neuroscience. What the fuck do you do? You know what I mean? LikeÉ.30400:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.130James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.30500:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.610James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah, well, that's good. I meanÉ It gives youÉ30600:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.569James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It forces you to do something new, and it's gonna be better, and you're gonna own it, you know?30700:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.580James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yeah.30800:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.399The Alliance: I agree.30900:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.960James Crowe/Vanderbilt: I feel optimistic that way about our team. I don'tÉ they're all scared, but I feel likeÉ31000:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.770James Crowe/Vanderbilt: It's gonna be better for us, because there's a winnowing.31100:49:58.130 --> 00:50:03.089James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And we may downsize a little bit and go through a narrow gate, but we're gonnaÉ31200:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.570James Crowe/Vanderbilt: We're gonna beÉ really, we're gonna be sole source after this.31300:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.300James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Which is pretty amazing.31400:50:09.120 --> 00:50:09.680James Crowe/Vanderbilt: SoÉ.31500:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.929The Alliance: So, let me ask you a question.31600:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.180James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Yup.31700:50:13.180 --> 00:50:19.410The Alliance: I might be able toÉ This could be really bad or really good, and you tell me.31800:50:19.980 --> 00:50:26.290The Alliance: I have a really dear friend, Joe Polish, who's one of my favorite people on the planet, whoÉ31900:50:27.040 --> 00:50:32.690The Alliance: is really tight. I know a couple people who are very, very tight with, RFK.32000:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.680The Alliance: Really tight with him.32100:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.760The Alliance: Work with him, have been involved with him, blah blah blah.32200:50:38.930 --> 00:50:44.459The Alliance: And if you're getting a lot ofÉ Pressure from the top.32300:50:46.260 --> 00:50:52.049The Alliance: I could have a conversation with Joe and say, hey, I'd like you to just talk to my friend Jim.32400:50:52.250 --> 00:50:59.919The Alliance: Like, he's not the enemy he's being treated like, and I think RFK would kind of like him.32500:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.640The Alliance: É AndÉ32600:51:03.280 --> 00:51:22.929The Alliance: would youÉ and he'd likeÉ he'd likeÉ so the other thing is, he would like what you're doing. Like, he wouldÉ even if he opposed it, he'd, like, he'd want to think about bringing you in as a speaker at one of his events. Like, it's the kind of thing where he'd be like, oh, you have a coolÉ you do a cool thing, I want to hear more about it. He's very curious.32700:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.240The Alliance: About all this stuff. É32800:51:25.240 --> 00:51:42.419The Alliance: he's a real blue-collar guy, but anyways, I couldÉ I gotta talk to Joe. I'm talking to Joe anytime, sometime soon, about an ongoing project. He's sort of out of town in August, but I might be able to make that introduction if you want it. Like, if he's open to a conversation.32900:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.709The Alliance: Maybe, like, maybe he, maybe it could help.33000:51:46.140 --> 00:51:54.619James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Well, I don'tÉ what I would say is I don't need intervention, because it's a systematic thing they're doing, I don't need personal intervention, butÉ33100:51:55.320 --> 00:52:03.400James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, what these guys don't like is vaccines, for weird reasons, that are not really very logical, but, like, the V word.33200:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.880James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And it is complicated, because a vaccine, you put aÉ33300:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.679James Crowe/Vanderbilt: substance in your body, and your body responds, whereas what we're doing33400:52:11.950 --> 00:52:24.310James Crowe/Vanderbilt: IsÉ we're taking blood from somebody who's already responded, they survive, they're good. We're making an antibody, and we're transferring it, and your body doesn't have to do anything but receive it.33500:52:24.530 --> 00:52:33.810James Crowe/Vanderbilt: So, we're basically transferring natural immunity from one person to another, and that natural immunity actually is best if the person's been infected and didn't die.33600:52:33.920 --> 00:52:48.649James Crowe/Vanderbilt: not evenÉ I mean, we can do it with vaccines, but if the person's been infected, we're moving their good molecules to another person. It's a different strategy that does not, you know, it doesn't modify your body, we're just giving you the antibody.33700:52:48.920 --> 00:52:56.860James Crowe/Vanderbilt: And in a way, it's a vaccine surrogate, and it's maybeÉ I don't like to say it publicly.33800:52:57.050 --> 00:53:01.160James Crowe/Vanderbilt: because I'm not anti-vax, but it's probably safer33900:53:01.510 --> 00:53:19.559James Crowe/Vanderbilt: than vaccines, and it can be used in more people, like babies and old people, and cancer patients, and so on. So it's more widely applicable, and what I'm saying to the science world is, this is coming, it's going to be equally as important as vaccines, if not more important, number one, because it works.34000:53:19.740 --> 00:53:27.990James Crowe/Vanderbilt: Number two, it's going to be more socially acceptable long-term to people who have vaccine hesitancy. So I'm interested in what34100:53:28.200 --> 00:53:43.919James Crowe/Vanderbilt: RFK and the current administration think about that idea of passive antibodies instead of vaccines, which is different from saying, hey, could you give me administrative relief of the bad stuff that's coming at me? Because it's just a systematic thing they're doing.34200:53:44.200 --> 00:53:52.250The Alliance: Alright, if that's the question, then theÉ it's aÉ it's not my friend Joe, it's my friend Isaac.
